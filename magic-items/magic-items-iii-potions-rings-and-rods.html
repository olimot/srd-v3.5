    <h2 id="potions-and-oils">Potions and Oils</h2>
    <p>
      A potion is a magic liquid that produces its effect when imbibed. Magic oils are similar to potions, except that
      oils are applied externally rather than imbibed. A potion or oil can be used only once. It can duplicate the
      effect of a spell of up to 3rd level that has a casting time of less than 1 minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Potions are like spells cast upon the imbiber. The character taking the potion doesn’t get to make any decisions
      about the effect —the caster who brewed the potion has already done so. The drinker of a potion is both the
      effective target and the caster of the effect (though the potion indicates the caster level, the drinker still
      controls the effect).
    </p>
    <p>The person applying an oil is the effective caster, but the object is the target.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Physical Description:</strong> A typical potion or oil consists of 1 ounce of liquid held in a ceramic or
      glass vial fitted with a tight stopper. The stoppered container is usually no more than 1 inch wide and 2 inches
      high. The vial has AC 13, 1 hit point, hardness 1, and a break DC of 12. Vials hold 1 ounce of liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Identifying Potions:</strong> In addition to the standard methods of identification, PCs can sample from
      each container they find to attempt to determine the nature of the liquid inside. An experienced character learns
      to identify potions by memory
    </p>
    <p>
      —for example, the last time she tasted a liquid that reminded her of almonds, it turned out to be a
      <i>potion of cure moderate wounds</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Activation:</strong> Drinking a potion or applying an oil requires no special skill. The user merely
      removes the stopper and swallows the potion or smears on the oil. The following rules govern potion and oil use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drinking a potion or using an oil on an item of gear is a standard action. The potion or oil takes effect
      immediately. Using a potion or oil provokes attacks of opportunity. A successful attack (including grappling
      attacks) against the character forces a Concentration check (as for casting a spell). If the character fails this
      check, she cannot drink the potion. An enemy may direct an attack of opportunity against the potion or oil
      container rather than against the character. A successful attack of this sort can destroy the container.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature must be able to swallow a potion or smear on an oil. Because of this, incorporeal creatures cannot use
      potions or oils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any corporeal creature can imbibe a potion. The potion must be swallowed. Any corporeal creature can use an oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character can carefully administer a potion to an unconscious creature as a full-round action, trickling the
      liquid down the creature’s throat. Likewise, it takes a full-round action to apply an oil to an unconscious
      creature.
    </p>
    <h2 id="potion-descriptions">Potion Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
      The caster level for a standard potion is the minimum caster level needed to cast the spell (unless otherwise
      specified).

    <h2 id="rings">Rings</h2>
    <p>Rings bestow magical powers upon their wearers. Only a rare few have charges. Anyone can use a ring.</p>
    <p>
      A character can only effectively wear two magic rings. A third magic ring doesn’t work if the wearer is already
      wearing two magic rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Physical Description:</strong> Rings have no appreciable weight. Although exceptions exist that are
      crafted from glass or bone, the vast majority of rings are forged from metal—usually precious metals such as gold,
      silver, and platinum. A ring has AC 13, 2 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 25.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Activation:</strong> Usually, a ring’s ability is activated by a command word (a standard action that does
      not provoke attacks of opportunity) or it works continually. Some rings have exceptional activation methods,
      according to their descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special Qualities:</strong> Roll d%. A result of 01 indicates the ring is intelligent, 02–31 indicates
      that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32–100 indicates no
      special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes.
      Rings with charges can never be intelligent.

    <p>Standard rings are described below.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Animal Friendship:</strong> On command, this ring affects an animal as if the wearer had cast
      <i>charm animal</i>.
    </p>
    <p>Faint enchantment; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, <i>charm animal;</i> Price 10,800 gp.</p>
    <p><strong>Blinking:</strong> On command, this ring makes the wearer blink, as with the <i>blink</i> spell.</p>
    <p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, <i>blink;</i> Price 27,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Chameleon Power:</strong> As a free action, the wearer of this ring can gain the ability to magically
      blend in with the surroundings. This provides a +10 competence bonus on her Hide checks. As a standard action, she
      can also command the ring to utilize the spell <i>disguise self</i> as often as she wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Forge Ring,
      <i>disguise self, invisibility;</i> Price 12,700 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Climbing:</strong> This ring is actually a magic leather cord that ties around a finger. It continually
      grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Climb checks.
    </p>
    <p>Faint transmutatation; CL 5th; Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in the Climb skill; Price 2,500 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Climbing, Improved:</strong> As climbing, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on its wearer’s Climb
      checks.
    </p>
    <p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks in the Climb skill; Price 10,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Counterspells:</strong> This ring might seem to be a <i>ring of spell storing</i> upon first examination.
      However, while it allows a single spell of 1st through 6th level to be cast into it, that spell cannot be cast out
      of the ring again. Instead, should that spell ever be cast upon the wearer, the spell is immediately countered, as
      a counterspell action, requiring no action (or even knowledge) on the wearer’s part. Once so used, the spell cast
      within the ring is gone. A new spell (or the same one as before) may be placed in it again.

      <i>imbue with spell ability;</i> Price 4,000 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Djinni Calling:</strong> One of the many rings of fable, this “genie” ring is most useful indeed. It
      serves as a special <i>gate</i> by means of which a specific djinni can be called from the Elemental Plane of Air.
      When the ring is rubbed (a standard action), the call goes out, and the djinni appears on the next round. The
      djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni
      of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless.
    </p>
    <p>Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Forge Ring, <i>gate;</i> Price 125,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Elemental Command:</strong> All four kinds of <i>elemental command</i> rings are very powerful. Each
      appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as
      single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate
      element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can’t attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of
      him. If the wearer desires, he may forego this protection and instead attempt to <i>charm</i> the elemental (as
      <i>charm monster,</i> Will DC 17 negates). If the <i>charm</i> attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost
      and no further attempt at <i>charming</i> can be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned who attack the wearer take a –1 penalty on their attack
      rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws from the extraplanar creature’s attacks with a +2 resistance
      bonus. He gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapon he uses bypasses the
      damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which his ring is attuned. These
      creatures recognize that he wears the ring. They show a healthy respect for the wearer if alignments are similar.
      If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if he is strong. If he is weak, they hate and desire to slay
      him.
    </p>
    <p>The possessor of a <i>ring of elemental command</i> takes a saving throw penalty as follows:</p>

      In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according
      to its kind.

    <p>Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Forge Ring, <i>summon monster VI</i>, all appropriate spells; Price 200,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Energy Resistance:</strong> This reddish iron ring continually protects the wearer from damage from one
      type of energy—acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic (chosen by the creator of the item; determine randomly if
      found as part of a treasure hoard). Each time the wearer would normally take such damage, subtract the ring’s
      resistance value from the damage dealt.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>minor ring of energy resistance</i> grants 10 points of resistance. A
      <i>major ring of energy resistance</i> grants 20 points of resistance. A
      <i>greater ring of energy resistance</i> grants 30 points of resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faint (minor or major) or moderate (greater) abjuration; CL 3rd (minor), 7th (major), or 11th (greater); Forge
      Ring, <i>resist energy;</i> Price 12,000 gp (minor), 28,000 gp (major), 44,000 gp (greater).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Evasion:</strong> This ring continually grants the wearer the ability to avoid damage as if she had
      evasion. Whenever she makes a Reflex saving throw to determine whether she takes half damage, a successful save
      results in no damage.
    </p>
    <p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, <i>jump;</i> Price 25,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Feather Falling:</strong> This ring is crafted with a feather pattern all around its edge. It acts exactly
      like a <i>feather fall</i> spell, activated immediately if the wearer falls more than 5 feet.
    </p>
    <p>Faint transmutation; CL 1st; Forge Ring, <i>feather fall;</i> Price 2,200 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Force Shield:</strong> An iron band, this simple ring generates a shield-sized (and shield-shaped)
      <i>wall of force</i> that stays with the ring and can be wielded by the wearer as if it were a heavy shield (+2
      AC). This special creation has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance since it is weightless and
      encumbrance-free. It can be activated and deactivated at will as a free action.
    </p>
    <p>Moderate evocation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, <i>wall of force;</i> Price 8,500 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Freedom of Movement:</strong> This gold ring allows the wearer to act as if continually under the effect
      of a <i>freedom of movement</i> spell.
    </p>
    <p>Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Forge Ring, <i>freedom of movement;</i> Price 40,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Friend Shield:</strong> These curious rings always come in pairs. A <i>friend shield</i> ring without its
      mate is useless. Either wearer of one of a pair of the rings can, at any time, command his or her ring to cast a
      <i>shield other</i> spell with the wearer of the mated ring as the recipient. This effect has no range limitation.
    </p>
    <p>Moderate abjuration; CL 10th; Forge Ring, <i>shield other;</i> Price 50,000 gp (for a pair).</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Invisibility:</strong> By activating this simple silver ring, the wearer can benefit from
      <i>invisibility</i>, as the spell.
    </p>
    <p>Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, <i>invisibility;</i> Price 20,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Jumping:</strong> This ring continually allows the wearer to leap about, providing a +5 competence bonus
      on all his Jump checks.
    </p>
    <p>Faint transmutation; CL 2nd; Forge Ring, creator must have 5 ranks in the Jump skill; Price 2,500 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Jumping, Improved:</strong> As jumping, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on its wearer’s Jump
      check.
    </p>
    <p>Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, creator must have 10 ranks in the Jump skill; Price 10,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mind Shielding:</strong> This ring is usually of fine workmanship and wrought from heavy gold. The wearer
      is continually immune to <i>detect thoughts, discern lies,</i> and any attempt to magically discern her alignment.
    </p>
    <p>Faint aburation; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, <i>nondetection;</i> Price 8,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Protection:</strong> This ring offers continual magical protection in the form of a deflection bonus of +1
      to +5 to AC.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Forge Ring, <i>shield of faith,</i> caster must be of a level at least three times
      greater than the bonus of the ring; Price 2,000 gp (<i>ring +1</i>); 8,000 gp (<i>ring +2</i>); 18,000 gp (<i
        >ring +3</i
      >); 32,000 gp (<i>ring +4</i>); 50,000 gp (<i>ring +5</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ram:</strong> The <i>ring of the ram</i> is an ornate ring forged of hard metal, usually iron or an iron
      alloy. It has the head of a ram as its device.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ramlike force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that
      resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1
      charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat
      this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet
      of the ring-wearer. (The ram has Strength 25 and is Large.) The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2
      charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to its attack mode, the <i>ring of the ram</i> also has the power to open doors as if it were a
      character with Strength 25. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with Strength 27.
      If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength 29.
    </p>
    <p>A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.</p>
    <p>
      Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring,
      <i>bull’s strength, telekinesis;</i> Price 8,600 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Regeneration:</strong> This white gold ring continually allows a living wearer to heal 1 point of damage
      per level every hour rather than every day. (This ability cannot be aided by the Heal skill.) Nonlethal damage
      heals at a rate of 1 point of damage per level every 5 minutes. If the wearer loses a limb, an organ, or any other
      body part while wearing this ring, the ring <i>regenerates</i> it as the spell. In either case, only damage taken
      while wearing the ring is regenerated.
    </p>
    <p>Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Forge Ring, <i>regenerate;</i> Price 90,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shooting Stars:</strong> This ring has two modes of operation, one for being in shadowy darkness or
      outdoors at night and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the night under the open sky or in areas of shadow or darkness, the
      <i>ring of shooting stars</i> can perform the following functions on command.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Dancing lights</i> (once per hour)</li>
      <li><i>Light</i> (twice per night)</li>
      <li><i>Ball lightning</i> (special, once per night)</li>
      <li><i>Shooting stars</i> (special, three per week)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The first special function, <i>ball lightning,</i> releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer’s choice).
      These glowing globes resemble <i>dancing lights</i>, and the ring wearer controls them in the same fashion (see
      the <i>dancing lights</i> spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They
      can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5
      feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of
      balls created.

    </table>
    <p>
      Once the <i>ball lightning</i> function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises.
      (Multiple balls can be released in the same round.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The second special function produces three <i>shooting stars</i> that can be released from the ring each week,
      simultaneously or one at a time. They impact for 12 points of damage and spread (as a <i>fireball</i>) in a
      5-foot-radius sphere for 24 points of fire damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any creature struck by a <i>shooting star</i> takes full damage from impact plus full fire damage from the spread
      unless it makes a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take
      only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. Range is 70 feet, at the end of which the
      <i>shooting star</i> explodes, unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A <i>shooting star</i> always
      follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a save or be hit by the projectile.
    </p>
    <p>Indoors at night, or underground, the <i>ring of shooting stars</i> has the following properties.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Faerie fire</i> (twice per day)</li>
      <li><i>Spark shower</i> (special, once per day)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <i>spark shower</i> is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of
      20 feet in an arc 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal
      armor or carrying a metal weapon. Those wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon take 4d8 points of
      damage.

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell Storing, Minor:</strong> A <i>minor ring of spell storing</i> contains up to three levels of spells
      that the wearer can cast. Each spell has a caster level equal to the minimum level needed to cast that spell. The
      user need not provide any material components or focus, or pay an XP cost to cast the spell, and there is no
      arcane spell failure chance for wearing armor (because the ring wearer need not gesture). The activation time for
      the ring is same as the casting time for the relevant spell, with a minimum of 1 standard action.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a randomly generated ring, treat it as a scroll to determine what spells are stored in it. If you roll a spell
      that would put the ring over the three-level limit, ignore that roll; the ring has no more spells in it. (Not
      every newly discovered ring need be fully charged.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A spellcaster can cast any spells into the ring, so long as the total spell levels do not add up to more than
      three. Metamagic versions of spells take up storage space equal to their spell level modified by the metamagic
      feat. A spellcaster can use a scroll to put a spell into the
      <i>minor ring of spell storing.</i>
    </p>
    <p>The ring magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells currently stored within it.</p>

    <h2 id="rods">Rods</h2>
    <p>
      Rods are scepterlike devices that have unique magical powers and do not usually have charges. Anyone can use a
      rod.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Rods weigh approximately 5 pounds.</p>
    <p>
      They range from 2 feet to 3 feet long and are usually made of iron or some other metal. (Many, as noted in their
      descriptions, can function as light maces or clubs due to their sturdy construction.)
    </p>
    <p>These sturdy items have AC 9, 10 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 27.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Activation:</strong> Details relating to rod use vary from item to item. See the individual descriptions
      for specifics.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special Qualities:</strong> Roll d%. A 01 result indicates the rod is intelligent, 02–31 indicates that
      something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32–100 indicates no special
      qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes.
    </p>
    <p>Rods with charges can never be intelligent.</p>

    <h2 id="rod-descriptions">Rod Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
      Although all rods are generally scepterlike, their configurations and abilities run the magical gamut. Standard
      rods are described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Absorption:</strong> This rod acts as a magnet, drawing spells or spell-like abilities into itself. The
      magic absorbed must be a single-target spell or a ray directed at either the character possessing the rod or her
      gear. The rod then nullifies the spell’s effect and stores its potential until the wielder releases this energy in
      the form of spells of her own. She can instantly detect a spell’s level as the rod absorbs that spell’s energy.
      Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell
      energy to cast any spell she has prepared, without expending the preparation itself. The only restrictions are
      that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the
      wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in hand
      when casting. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod’s energy can be used to
      cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>rod of absorption</i> absorbs a maximum of fifty spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining
      potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod’s remaining absorbing potential
      and current amount of stored energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then
      roll d% again: On a result of 71–100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored within.
    </p>
    <p>Strong abjuration; CL 15th;Craft Rod, <i>spell turning;</i> Price 50,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Alertness:</strong> This rod is indistinguishable from a <i>+1 light mace.</i> It has eight flanges on its
      macelike head. The rod bestows a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks. If grasped firmly, the rod enables the
      holder to use <i>detect evil, detect good, detect chaos, detect law</i>,
      <i>detect magic, discern lies, light,</i> or <i>see invisibility.</i> Each different use is a standard action.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the head of a <i>rod of alertness</i> is planted in the ground, and the possessor wills it to alertness (a
      standard action), the rod senses any creature within 120 feet who intends to harm the possessor. At the same time,
      the rod creates the effect of a <i>prayer</i> spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot
      radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning them of
      possible danger from the unfriendly creature or creatures within the 120-foot radius. These effects last for 10
      minutes, and the rod can perform this function once per day. Last, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of
      an <i>animate objects</i> spell, utilizing any eleven (or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the
      perimeter of a 5-foot-radius circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground. Objects remain animated for 11
      rounds. The rod can perform this function once per day.
    </p>

        prayer, animate objects;</i
      >
      Price 85,000 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cancellation:</strong> This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item of all
      magical properties. The item touched must make a DC 23 Will save to prevent the rod from draining it. If a
      creature is holding it at the time, then the item can use the holder’s Will save bonus in place of its own if the
      holder’s is better. In such cases, contact is made by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining an item, the
      rod itself becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by <i>wish</i>or
      <i>miracle.</i> (If a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> and a <i>rod of cancellation</i> negate each other, nothing
      can restore either of them.)
    </p>
    <p>Strong abjuration; CL 17th; Craft Rod, <i>mage’s disjunction;</i> Price 11,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Enemy Detection:</strong> This device pulses in the wielder’s hand and points in the direction of any
      creature or creatures hostile to the bearer of the device (nearest ones first). These creatures can be invisible,
      ethereal, hidden, disguised, or in plain sight. Detection range is 60 feet. If the bearer of the rod concentrates
      for a full round, the rod pinpoints the location of the nearest enemy and indicates how many enemies are within
      range. The rod can be used three times each day, each use lasting up to 10 minutes. Activating the rod is a
      standard action.
    </p>
    <p>Moderate divination; CL 10th; Craft Rod, <i>true seeing;</i> Price 23,500 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Flailing:</strong> Upon the command of its possessor, the rod activates, changing from a normal-seeming
      rod to a <i>+3 dire flail</i>. The dire flail is a double weapon, which means that each of the weapon’s heads can
      be used to attack. The wielder can gain an extra attack (with the second head) at the cost of making all attacks
      at a –2 penalty (as if she had the Two-Weapon Fighting feat).
    </p>
    <p>
      Once per day the wielder can use a free action to cause the rod to grant her a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class
      and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws for 10 minutes. The rod need not be in weapon form to grant this
      benefit.
    </p>
    <p>Transforming it into a weapon or back into a rod is a move action.</p>
    <p>
      Moderate enchantment; CL 9th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>bless;</i> Price 50,000 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Flame Extinguishing:</strong> This rod can extinguish Medium or smaller nonmagical fires with simply a
      touch (a standard action). For the rod to be effective against other sorts of fires, the wielder must expend 1 or
      more of the rod’s charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extinguishing a Large or larger nonmagical fire, or a magic fire of Medium or smaller (such as that of a flaming
      weapon or a
      <i>burning hands</i> spell), expends 1 charge. Continual magic flames, such as those of a weapon or a fire
      creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire
      spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used a ready action, effectively
      countering the entire spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      When applied to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by
      <i>fireball, flame strike,</i> or <i>wall of fire</i>, extinguishing the flames expends 2 charges from the rod.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the device is used upon a fire creature (a melee touch attack), it deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature.
      This use requires 3 charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>rod of flame extinguishing</i> has 10 charges when found. Spent charges are renewed every day, so that a
      wielder can expend up to 10 charges in any 24-hour period.

    <p>
      <strong>Immovable Rod:</strong> This rod is a flat iron bar with a small button on one end. When the button is
      pushed (a move action), the rod does not move from where it is, even if staying in place defies gravity. Thus, the
      owner can lift or place the rod wherever he wishes, push the button, and let go. Several <i>immovable rods</i> can
      even make a ladder when used together (although only two are needed). An <i>immovable rod</i> can support up to
      8,000 pounds before falling to the ground. If a creature pushes against an <i>immovable rod,</i> it must make a DC
      30 Strength check to move the rod up to 10 feet in a single round.

    <p>
      <strong>Lordly Might:</strong> This rod has functions that are spell-like, and it can also be used as a magic
      weapon of various sorts. It also has several more mundane uses. The <i>rod of lordly might</i> is metal, thicker
      than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. (Pushing any of the
      rod’s buttons is equivalent to drawing a weapon.) It weighs 10 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Hold person</i> upon touch, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use
        this power and then succeed on a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is
        lost.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Fear</i> upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial).
        Invoking this power is a standard action.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half ) and cure the
        wielder of a like amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with
        <i>hold person.</i>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following weapon functions of the rod have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In its normal form, the rod can be used as a <i>+2 light mace.</i></li>
      <li>
        When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a
        <i>+1 flaming longsword.</i> A blade springs from the ball, with the ball itself becoming the sword’s hilt. The
        weapon lengthens to an overall length of 4 feet.
      </li>
      <li>
        When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a <i>+4 battleaxe.</i> A wide blade springs forth at the ball, and the
        whole lengthens to 4 feet.
      </li>
      <li>
        When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a <i>+3 shortspear</i> or <i>+3 longspear.</i> The spear blade springs
        forth, and the handle can be lengthened up to 12 feet (wielder’s choice), for an overall length of from 6 feet
        to 15 feet. At its 15-foot length, the rod is suitable for use as a lance.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Climbing pole/ladder. When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in granite is extruded from the ball,
        while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single
        round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars three inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot
        apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds.
        The wielder can retract the pole by pushing button 5.
      </li>
      <li>
        The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod’s base 30 feet or less from the
        portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength modifier of +12.
      </li>
      <li>
        When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder a knowledge of his approximate
        depth beneath the surface or height above it.
      </li>

      Price 70,000 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Metal and Mineral Detection:</strong> This rod pulses in the wielder’s hand and points to the largest mass
      of metal within 30 feet. However, the wielder can concentrate on a specific metal or mineral. If the specific
      mineral is within 30 feet, the rod points to any places it is located, and the rod wielder knows the approximate
      quantity as well. If more than one deposit of the specified metal or mineral is within range, the rod points to
      the largest cache first. Each operation requires a full-round action.
    </p>
    <p>Moderate divination; CL 9th; Craft Rod, <i>locate object;</i> Price 10,500 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Metamagic Rods:</strong> Metamagic rods hold the essence of a metamagic feat but do not change the spell
      slot of the altered spell. All the rods described here are use-activated (but casting spells in a threatened area
      still draws an attack of opportunity). A caster may only use one metamagic rod on any given spell, but it is
      permissible to combine a rod with metamagic feats possessed by the rod’s wielder. In this case, only the feats
      possessed by the wielder adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possession of a metamagic rod does not confer the associated feat on the owner, only the ability to use the given
      feat a specified number of times per day. A sorcerer still must take a full-round action when using a metamagic
      rod, just as if using a metamagic feat he possesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Lesser and Greater Metamagic Rods:</em> Normal metamagic rods can be used with spells of 6th level or lower.
      Lesser rods can be used with spells of 3rd level or lower, while greater rods can be used with spells of 9th level
      or lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Metamagic, Empower:</strong> The wielder can cast up to three spells per day that are empowered as though
      using the Empower Spell feat.

      (greater).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Negation:</strong> This device negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of magic items. The
      wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking
      as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray functions as a <i>greater dispel magic</i> spell, except it only affects
      magic items. To negate instantaneous effects from an item, the rod wielder needs to have used a ready action. The
      dispel check uses the rod’s caster level (15th). The target item gets no saving throw, although the rod can’t
      negate artifacts (even minor artifacts). The rod can function three times per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong varied; CL 15th; Craft Rod, <i>dispel magic,</i> and <i>limited wish</i> or <i>miracle;</i> Price 37,000
      gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Python:</strong> This rod is longer than normal rods. It is about 4 feet long and weighs 10 pounds. It
      strikes as a <i>+1/+1 quarterstaff</i>. If the user throws the rod to the ground (a standard action), it grows to
      become a giant constrictor snake by the end of the round. The python obeys all commands of the owner. (In animal
      form, it retains the +1 enhancement bonus on attacks and damage possessed by the rod form.) The serpent returns to
      rod form (a full-round action) whenever the wielder desires, or whenever it moves farther than 100 feet from the
      owner. If the snake form is slain, it returns to rod form and cannot be activated again for three days. A
      <i>python rod</i> only functions if the possessor is good.

      <i>baleful polymorph,</i> creator must be good; Price 13,000 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rulership:</strong> This rod looks like a royal scepter worth at least 5,000 gp in materials and
      workmanship alone. The wielder can command the obedience and fealty of creatures within 120 feet when she
      activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 300 Hit Dice can be ruled, but creatures with
      Intelligence scores of 12 or higher are entitled to a DC 16 Will save to negate the effect. Ruled creatures obey
      the wielder as if she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is contrary to the
      nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is broken. The rod can be used for 500 total minutes before crumbling
      to dust. This duration need not be continuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong enchantment; CL 20th; Craft Rod, <i>mass charm monster;</i> Price 60,000 gp; Cost 27,500 gp + 2,200 XP.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Security:</strong> This item creates a nondimensional space, a pocket paradise. There the rod’s possessor
      and as many as 199 other creatures can stay in complete safety for a period of time, up to 200 days divided by the
      number of creatures affected. All fractions are rounded down.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this pocket paradise, creatures don’t age, and natural healing take place at twice the normal rate. Fresh water
      and food (fruits and vegetables only) are in abundance. The climate is comfortable for all creatures involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Activating the rod (a standard action) causes the wielder and all creatures touching the rod to be transported
      instantaneously to the paradise. Members of large groups can hold hands or otherwise maintain physical contact,
      allowing all connected creatures in a circle or a chain to be affected by the rod. Unwilling creatures get a DC 17
      Will save to negate the effect. If such a creature succeeds on its save, other creatures beyond that point in a
      chain can still be affected by the rod.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the rod’s effect expires or is dispelled, all the affected creatures instantly reappear in the location they
      occupied when the rod was activated. If something else occupies the space that a traveler would be returning to,
      then his body is displaced a sufficient distance to provide the space required for reentry. The rod’s possessor
      can dismiss the effect whenever he wishes before the maximum time period expires, but the rod can only be
      activated once per week.

    <p>Strong conjuuration; CL 20th; Craft Rod, <i>gate;</i> Price 61,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Splendor:</strong> The possessor of this rod gains a +4 enhancement bonus to her Charisma score for as
      long as she holds or carries the item. Once per day, the rod creates and garbs her in clothing of the finest
      fabrics, plus adornments of furs and jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparel created by the magic of the rod remains in existence for 12 hours. However, if the possessor attempts to
      sell or give away any part of it, to use it for a spell component, or the like, all the apparel immediately
      disappears. The same applies if any of it is forcibly taken from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The value of noble garb created by the rod ranges from 7,000 to 10,000 gp (1d4+6 x 1,000 gp)—1,000 gp for the
      fabric alone, 5,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for the jewel trim (maximum of twenty gems, maximum value 200 gp
      each).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the rod has a second special power, usable once per week. Upon command, it creates a palatial tent—a
      huge pavilion of silk 60 feet across. Inside the tent are temporary furnishings and food suitable to the splendor
      of the pavilion and sufficient to entertain as many as one hundred persons. The tent and its trappings last for
      one day. At the end of that time, the tent and all objects associated with it (including any items that were taken
      out of the tent) disappear.

      <strong>Thunder and Lightning:</strong> Constructed of iron set with silver rivets, this rod has the properties of
      a <i>+2 light mace</i>. Its other magical powers are as follows.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Thunder:</i> Once per day, the rod can strike as a <i>+3 light mace,</i> and the opponent struck is stunned
        from the noise of the rod’s impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this power counts as a free action, and
        it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Lightning:</i> Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of electricity can leap forth when the
        rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a <i>+2 light mace</i> (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of
        electricity damage. Even when the rod might not score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to
        count as a successful melee touch attack hit, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still applies. The
        wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Thunderclap:</i> Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening
        noise, just as a <i>shout</i> spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for
        2d6 rounds).
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Lightning Stroke:</i> Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a
        5-foot-wide lightning bolt (9d6 points of electricity damage, Reflex DC 16 half ) to a range of 200 feet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Thunder and Lightning:</i> Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the
        <i>thunderclap</i> described above with a lightning bolt, as in the <i>lightning stroke.</i> The thunderclap
        affects all within 10 feet of the bolt. The <i>lightning stroke</i> deals 9d6 points of electricity damage
        (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the <i>thunderclap</i> deals 2d6
        points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects.

    <p>
      <strong>Viper:</strong> This rod strikes as a <i>+2 heavy mace</i>. Once per day, upon command, the head of the
      rod becomes that of an actual serpent for 10 minutes. During this period, any successful strike with the rod deals
      its usual damage and also poisons the creature hit. The poison deals 1d10 points of Constitution damage
      immediately (Fortitude DC 14 negates) and another 1d10 points of Constitution damage 1 minute later (Fortitude DC
      14 negates). The rod only functions if its possessor is evil.

      Moderate necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>poison,</i> creator must be evil; Price 19,000 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Withering:</strong> A <i>rod of withering</i> acts as a <i>+1 light mace</i> that deals no hit point
      damage. Instead, the wielder deals 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage to any
      creature she touches with the rod (by making a melee touch attack). If she scores a critical hit, the damage from
      that hit is permanent ability drain. In either case, the defender negates the effect with a DC 17 Fortitude save.

      <strong>Wonder:</strong> A <i>rod of wonder</i> is a strange and unpredictable device that randomly generates any
