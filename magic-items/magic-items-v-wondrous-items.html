    <h2 id="wondrous-items">Wondrous Items</h2>
    <p>
      This is a catch-all category for anything that doesn’t fall into the other groups. Anyone can use a wondrous item
      (unless specified otherwise in the description).
    </p>
    <p><strong id="wondrous-items--physical-description">Physical Description:</strong> Varies.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="wondrous-items--activation">Activation:</strong> Usually use activated or command word, but details
      vary from item to item.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="wondrous-items--special-qualities">Special Qualities:</strong> Roll d%. An 01 result indicates the
      wondrous item is intelligent, 02–31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue
      to its function, and 32–100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes
      extraordinary powers and special purposes.
    </p>
    <p>Wondrous items with charges can never be intelligent.</p>

    <p>
      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--amulet-of-the-planes">Amulet of the Planes:</strong> This device usually
      appears to be a black circular amulet, although any character looking closely at it sees a dark, moving swirl of
      color. The amulet allows its wearer to utilize <i>plane shift</i>. However, this is a difficult item to master.
      The user must make a DC 15 Intelligence check in order to get the amulet to take her to the plane (and the
      specific location on that plane) that she wants. If she fails, the amulet transports her and all those traveling
      with her to a random location on that plane (01–60 on d%) or to a random plane (61–100).

        >Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location:</strong
      >
      This silver amulet protects the wearer from scrying and magical location just as a <i>nondetection</i> spell does.
      If a divination spell is attempted against the wearer, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level
      check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the caster had cast <i>nondetection</i> on herself ).

      to be a large, sealed iron barrel, but it has a secret catch (Search DC 20 to locate) that opens a hatch in one
      end. Anyone who crawls inside finds ten (unlabeled) levers: The device has the following characteristics: hp 200;

      Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be operated more than once per round. However, since
      two Medium characters can fit inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round. The device can function
      in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a
      single occupant). When activated, the apparatus looks something like a giant lobster.

      If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined.
      All contents are lost forever. If a <i>bag of holding</i> is turned inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed,
      but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can
      survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a
      <i>bag of holding</i> is a move action—unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which
      case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a <i>bag of holding</i> is placed within a <i>portable hole</i> a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the
      space: Bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a <i>portable hole</i> is placed within a
      <i>bag of holding,</i> it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot
      radius are drawn there, destroying the <i>portable hole</i> and <i>bag of holding</i> in the process.

      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--bag-of-tricks">Bag of Tricks:</strong> This small sack appears normal and
      empty. However, anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20
      feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or
      until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands
      described in the Handle Animal skill. Each of the three kinds of a <i>bag of tricks</i> produces a different set
      of animals. Use the following tables to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy warhorse appears with harness and tack and accepts the character who drew it from the bag as a rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time. Up to ten animals can be drawn from the bag
      each week.

      It functions like a <i>resilient sphere</i> spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration

      the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell’s duration. The sphere is not subject to
      damage of any sort except from a <i>rod of cancellation,</i> a <i>rod of negation, disintegrate,</i> or a targeted
      <i>dispel magic</i> spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through
      the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot
      be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.

      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--chime-of-opening">Chime of Opening:</strong> A <i>chime of opening</i> is
      a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids,
      doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on.
      A <i>chime of opening</i> also automatically dispels a <i>hold portal</i> spell or even an <i>arcane lock</i> cast
      by a wizard of lower than 15th level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the
      user). The chime is then struck, a clear tone rings forth, and in 1 round the target lock is unlocked, the shackle
      is loosed, the secret door is opened, or the lid of the chest is lifted. Each sounding only opens one form of
      locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and <i>arcane locked,</i> it takes four uses of a
      <i>chime of opening</i> to get it open. A <i>silence</i> spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime
      can be used a total of ten times before it cracks and becomes useless.

      to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats objects
      within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of
      <i>blur</i> and <i>displacement.</i> (In this, it works just like the <i>faerie fire</i> spell). The dust also
      reveals figments, <i>mirror images</i>, and <i>projected images</i> for what they are. A creature coated with the
      dust takes a –30 penalty on its Hide checks. The dust’s effect lasts for 5 minutes.

      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--dust-of-disappearance">Dust of Disappearance:</strong> This dust looks
      just like <i>dust of appearance</i> and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it
      becomes invisible (as <i>greater invisibility</i>). Normal vision can’t see dusted creatures or objects, nor can
      they be detected by magical means, including <i>see invisibility</i> or <i>invisibility purge</i>.
      <i>Dust of appearance,</i> however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by
      <i>dust of disappearance.</i> Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection.

      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--dust-of-dryness">Dust of Dryness:</strong> This special dust has many
      uses. If it is thrown into water, a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed to nothingness, and
      the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled down, it
      breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other
      liquids.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the dust is employed against an elemental with the water subtype, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save
      or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the creature even if its saving throw succeeds.

      <i>dust of illusion</i> on a creature, and that creature is affected as if by a <i>disguise self</i> glamer, with
      the individual who sprinkles the dust envisioning the illusion desired. An unwilling target is allowed a DC 11
      Reflex save to avoid the dust. The glamer lasts for 2 hours.

      dust is actually a magic powder that can conceal the passage of its possessor and his companions. Tossing a
      handful of this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to 100 square feet of floor space to become as dusty,
      dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a decade.
    </p>
    <p>
      A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage of as many as a dozen men and horses to
      be obliterated for 250 feet back into the distance. The results of the dust are instantaneous, and no magical aura

      space allowing it to store far more than would normally be possible. The first and smallest one can contain up to
      sixty objects of the same general size and shape as an arrow. The second slightly longer compartment holds up to
      eighteen objects of the same general size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case
      contains as many as six objects of the same general size and shape as a bow (spears, staffs, or the like). Once
      the owner has filled it, the quiver can produce any item she wishes, as if from a regular quiver or scabbard. The

      of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. A thin stream of smoke is often seen issuing from
      it. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle
      instantly. There is a 10% chance (01–10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being
      released. There is also a 10% chance (91–100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three <i>wishes</i>. In either
      case, the efreeti afterward disappears forever. The other 80% of the time (11–90), the inhabitant of the bottle
      loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti’s death), doing as she commands.

    <p>
      She is compelled to answer any questions put to her in that time, but with each question she is free to make a

      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--eversmoking-bottle">Eversmoking Bottle:</strong> This metal urn is
      identical in appearance to an <i>efreeti bottle,</i> except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is
      great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread
      in 1 round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another 10 feet per round until it has
      covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains smoke-filled until the <i>eversmoking bottle</i> is stoppered.
    </p>

      failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the <i>doom</i> spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the

      come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different
      function:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>The Goat of Traveling:</i> This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse
        in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of one day each week—continuously or in any
        combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its
        statuette form for not less than one day before it can again be used.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>The Goat of Travail:</i> This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics
        of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each
        horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful
        attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>The Goat of Terror:</i> When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like
        mount, with the statistics of a light warhorse. However, its rider can employ the goat’s horns as weapons (one
        horn as a <i>+3 heavy lance,</i> the other as a <i>+5 longsword</i>). When ridden in an attack against an
        opponent, the <i>goat of terror</i> radiates <i>fear</i> as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial).
        It can be used once every two weeks for up to 3 hours per use.

      the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command
      word, a <i>marble elephant</i> grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from
      the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine’s owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant.

      figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely
      resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat
      it as a heavy warhorse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will:
      <i>overland flight, plane shift,</i> and <i>ethereal jaunt.</i> The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the
      rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to
      its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that
      when an <i>obsidian steed</i> becomes ethereal or <i>plane shifts,</i> its rider and his gear follow suit.
    </p>
    <p>Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.</p>

      Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. (It has the
      scent ability and adds +4 to its Spot and Search checks.) It has 60-foot darkvision, and it can

      transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three
      transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties. The owl communicates with its

      figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10).
      Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an
      <i>animal messenger</i> spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner,

      <em id="wondrous-item-descriptions--feather-token--fan">Fan:</em> A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing
      a breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind

        Another command word causes the <i>gem of brightness</i> to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet

        unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.
      </li>
      <li>
        The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although
        this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for
        1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.

      a +5 competence bonus on skill checks made to craft the golem’s body. Each manual also holds the prerequisite
      spells needed for a specific golem, effectively grants the builder use of the Craft Construct feat during the
      construction of the golem, and grants the character an increase to her caster level for the purpose of crafting a
      golem. Any golem built using a <i>golem manual</i> does not cost the creator any XP, since the requisite XP are
      “contained” in the book and “expended” by the book during the creation process.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spells included in a <i>golem manual</i> require a spell trigger activation and can be activated only to
      assist in the construction of a golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing the golem’s

      to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It is constructed of finely tanned leather, and the straps have
      brass hardware and buckles. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of
      material. In fact, each is like a <i>bag of holding</i> and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet
      in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80
      pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.

    <p>
      While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power in addition. When the wearer reaches into
      it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find
      what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke
      the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.

      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--helm-of-brilliance">Helm of Brilliance:</strong> This normal-looking helm
      takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant
      silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: ten diamonds, twenty rubies, thirty
      fire opals, and forty opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in
      all directions from its crownlike, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels’ functions are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Diamond: <i>Prismatic spray</i> (save DC 20)</li>
      <li>Ruby: <i>Wall of fire</i></li>
      <li>Fire opal: <i>Fireball</i> (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half )</li>
      <li>Opal: <i>Daylight</i></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels
      are depleted, a
      <i>helm of brilliance</i> also has the following magical properties when activated.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to
        all such creatures within that range.
      </li>
      <li>
        The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever
        abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round
        to take effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        The helm provides resistance to fire 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other
        sources.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder.
      Removing a jewel destroys it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and
      fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds
      become <i>prismatic sprays</i> that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies
      become straight-line <i>walls of fire</i> extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire
      opals become <i>fireballs</i> centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.

      Regeneration from the pearly white <i>ioun stone</i> works like a <i>ring of regeneration.</i> (It only cures
      damage taken while the character is using the stone.) The pale lavender and lavender and green stones work like a
      <i>rod of absorption,</i> but absorbing a spell requires a readied action, and these stones cannot be used to
      empower spells. Stored spells in the vibrant purple stone must be placed by a spellcaster but can be used by
      anyone (see <i>ring of minor spell storing</i>).

      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--iron-bands-of-binding">Iron Bands of Binding:</strong> When initially
      discovered, this very potent item appears to be a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere with bandings on the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand
      and then contract to bind the target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller
      creature can be captured thus and held immobile until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical
      form again. The creature can break (and ruin) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30
      Escape Artist check. <i>Iron bands of binding</i> are usable once per day.

      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--iron-flask">Iron Flask:</strong> These special containers are typically
      inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special
      symbols. When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container,
      provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time
      can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature.
    </p>
    <p>The command word can be given only once per day.</p>
    <p>
      If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1
      hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually
      attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask
      a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile. A newly discovered bottle might
      contain any of the following:

      form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the desired image. One pot of <i>marvelous pigments</i> is
      sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface.

    <p>
      Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures can’t be created. The pigments must be applied to a

      device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then
      activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A
      <i>mirror of life trapping</i> has fifteen nonspatial extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming
      within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within
      the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection.
      The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if
      the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).
    </p>
    <p>
      When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead
      are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim’s equipment (including clothing
      and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror’s owner knows the right command word, he can call the
      reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation.
      Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the mirror’s capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the

        Use it as a portal to visit other places. The user first views the place with the <i>clairvoyance</i> function,

        invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she
        returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she’s still in the
        other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence of 12 or higher
        might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a <i>scrying</i> spell. Any creature who
        steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror.

      as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character’s worn magic items is
      effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is—a golden chain from which
      hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily
      hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a
      <i>fireball</i> spell (Reflex DC 14 half ).

      Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal

      until the rats appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10 Perform (wind instruments) check. Success
      means that they obey the piper’s telepathic commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they

      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--robe-of-useful-items">Robe of Useful Items:</strong> This appears to be an
      unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small cloth patches of various
      shapes. Only the wearer of the robe can see these patches, recognize them for what items they become, and detach
      them. One patch can be detached each round. Detaching a patch causes it to become an actual item, as indicated
      below. A newly created <i>robe of useful items</i> always has two each of the following patches:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dagger</li>
      <li>Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)</li>
      <li>Mirror (a highly polished 2-foot-by-4-foot steel mirror)</li>

      In addition, the robe has several other patches. Roll 4d4 for the number of other patches and then roll for each

      <i>rope of climbing</i> is no thicker than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command,
      the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other direction at 10 feet per round, attaching itself
      securely wherever its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>rope of climbing</i> can be commanded to knot or unknot itself. This causes large knots to appear at 1-foot
      intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length until the knots are untied but lowers the
      DC of Climb checks while using it by 10. A creature must hold one end of the rope when its magic is invoked.

      normally, or it can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine).

      coated with 1 ounce of <i>salve of slipperiness</i>, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the
      flask, a new application of the <i>salve of slipperiness</i> must be put in the flask within 1 round to prevent
      the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of <i>sovereign glue,</i> when found, holds
      anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8–1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask’s capacity taken up
      by the <i>salve of slipperiness.</i> One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually
      any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart
      (a move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless.
      If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects has no effect, except when

      The possessor of such a stone need but utter a few words of summoning, and a Huge earth elemental comes to the

      is Large instead, and the stone functions as the <i>summon monster VI</i> spell.) The elemental appears in 1d4
      rounds. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new patch of earth or stone,
      which cannot be accessed until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).

      A <i>stone horse</i> can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or feed. Damage dealt to it can be

      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--tome-of-understanding">Tome of Understanding:</strong> This thick book
      contains tips for improving instinct and perception, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect.
      If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, she gains an inherent bonus
      of from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to her Wisdom score. Once the book is read, the magic disappears
      from the pages and it becomes a normal book.

      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--unguent-of-timelessness">Unguent of Timelessness:</strong> When applied to
      any matter that was once alive this ointment allows that substance to resist the passage of time. Each year of
      actual time affects the substance as if only a day had passed. The coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on
      all saving throws. The unguent never wears off, although it can be magically removed (by dispelling the effect,
      for instance). One flask contains enough material to coat eight Medium or smaller objects. A Large object counts
      as two Medium objects, and a Huge object counts as two Large objects.

      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--well-of-many-worlds">Well of Many Worlds:</strong> This strange,
      interdimensional device looks just like a <i>portable hole.</i> Anything placed within it is immediately cast to
      another world—a parallel world, another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved, the
      random factor again comes into play. It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a <i>portable hole</i> can
      be. Objects from the world the well touches can come through the opening just as easily as from the initiating
      place. (It is a two-way portal.)

      <strong id="wondrous-item-descriptions--wind-fan">Wind Fan:</strong> A <i>wind fan</i> appears to be nothing more
      than a wood and papyrus or cloth instrument with which to create a cooling breeze. By uttering the command word,
      its possessor causes the fan to generate air movement duplicating a <i>gust of wind</i> spell. The fan can be used
      once per day with no risk. If it is used more frequently, there is a 20% cumulative chance per usage during that
      day that the device tears into useless, nonmagical tatters.

      appear to be nothing more than a plain cloak of old, black cloth, or they could be as elegant as a long cape of
      blue feathers. When the wearer speaks the command word, the cloak turns into a pair of bat or bird wings that
      empower her to fly with a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability).
