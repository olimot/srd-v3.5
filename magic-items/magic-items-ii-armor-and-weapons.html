    <h1>MAGIC ITEMS II (ARMOR &amp; WEAPONS)</h1>

    <h2 id="armor">Armor</h2>
    <p>
      In general, magic armor protects the wearer to a greater extent than nonmagical armor. Magic armor bonuses are
      enhancement bonuses, never rise above +5, and stack with regular armor bonuses (and with shield and magic shield
      enhancement bonuses). All magic armor is also masterwork armor, reducing armor check penalties by 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities. Special abilities usually count as
      additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. A suit of armor cannot have
      an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A suit of armor with a
      special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      A suit of armor or a shield may be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01–95 indicates that the item is of a
      standard sort, and 96–100 indicates that it is made of a special material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armor is always created so that even if the type of armor comes with boots or gauntlets, these pieces can be
      switched for other magic boots or gauntlets.

    <p>
      <strong id="armor--caster-level-for-armor-and-shields">Caster Level for Armor and Shields:</strong> The caster
      level of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with
      only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an
      enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--shields">Shields:</strong> Shield enhancement bonuses stack with armor enhancement bonuses.
      Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as attack or damage bonuses when the shield is used in a bash. The bashing
      special ability, however, does grant a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls (see the special ability description).
    </p>
    <p>
      A shield could be built that also acted as a magic weapon, but the cost of the enhancement bonus on attack rolls
      would need to be added into the cost of the shield and its enhancement bonus to AC.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value in the form of additions to the
      bonus of the shield, although they do not improve AC. A shield cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus
      special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability must have at least a +1
      enhancement bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--shield-hardness-and-hit-points">Shield Hardness and Hit Points:</strong> Each +1 of enhancement
      bonus adds 2 to a shield’s hardness and +10 to its hit points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--activation">Activation:</strong> Usually a character benefits from magic armor and shields in
      exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields—by wearing them. If armor or a shield has a
      special ability that the user needs to activate then the user usually needs to utter the command word (a standard
      action).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-for-unusual-creatures">Armor for Unusual Creatures:</strong> The cost of armor for
      nonhumanoid creatures, as well as for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium, varies. The cost of the
      masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.

      Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have one or more of the special

      both her hands. Only one shield can protect a character at a time. A character with an animated shield still takes

      with this ability attracts ranged weapons to it. It has a deflection bonus of +1 against ranged weapons because
      projectiles and thrown weapons veer toward it. Additionally, any projectile or thrown weapon aimed at a target
      within 5 feet of the shield’s wearer diverts from its original target and targets the shield’s bearer instead. (If
      the wielder has total cover relative to the attacker, the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted.)
      Additionally, those attacking the wearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chances that would normally apply.
      Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an enhancement bonus higher than the shield’s base AC bonus are not
      diverted to the wearer (but the shield’s increased AC bonus still applies against these weapons). The wielder can
      activate or deactivate this ability with a command word.

      by a ranged weapon, he can make a DC 20 Reflex save. If the ranged weapon has an enhancement bonus, the DC
      increases by that amount. If he succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. He must be aware of the attack and not
      flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn’t count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as
      boulders hurled by giants or <i>acid arrows</i>, can’t be deflected.

    </p>
    <h2 id="weapons">Weapons</h2>
    <p>
      Magic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses to both attack and damage
      rolls when used in combat. All magic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonus on attack
      rolls does not stack with their enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be
      used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonus applies to either type of attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to an enhancement bonus, weapons may have special abilities. Special abilities count as additional
      bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses (except where
      specifically noted). A single weapon cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus
      equivalents) higher than +10. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      A weapon or a kind of ammunition may be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01–95 indicates that the item is of
      a standard sort, and 96–100 indicates that it is made of a special material.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--caster-level-for-weapons">Caster Level for Weapons:</strong> The caster level of a weapon
      with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus and no other
      abilities, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a
      special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--additional-damage-dice">Additional Damage Dice:</strong> Some magic weapons deal additional
      dice of damage. Unlike other modifiers to damage, additional dice of damage are not multiplied when the attacker
      scores a critical hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--ranged-weapons-and-ammunition">Ranged Weapons and Ammunition:</strong> The enhancement bonus
      from a ranged weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus from ammunition. Only the higher of the two
      enhancement bonuses applies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon
      for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an
      alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already have).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--magic-ammunition-and-breakage">Magic Ammunition and Breakage:</strong> When a magic arrow,
      crossbow bolt, or sling bullet misses its target, there is a 50% chance it breaks or otherwise is rendered
      useless. A magic arrow, bolt, or bullet that hits is destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--light-generation">Light Generation:</strong> Fully 30% of magic weapons shed light equivalent
      to a <i>light</i> spell (bright light in a 20-foot radius, shadowy light in a 40-foot radius). These glowing
      weapons are quite obviously magical. Such a weapon can’t be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off.
      Some of the specific weapons detailed below always or never glow, as defined in their descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--hardness-and-hit-points">Hardness and Hit Points:</strong> An attacker cannot damage a magic
      weapon that has an enhancement bonus unless his own weapon has at least as high an enhancement bonus as the weapon
      or shield struck. Each +1 of enhancement bonus also adds 1 to the weapon’s or shield’s hardness and hit points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--activation">Activation:</strong> Usually a character benefits from a magic weapon in the same
      way a character benefits from a mundane weapon—by attacking with it. If a weapon has a special ability that the
      user needs to activate then the user usually needs to utter a command word (a standard action).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--magic-weapons-and-critical-hits">Magic Weapons and Critical Hits:</strong> Some weapon
      qualities and some specific weapons have an extra effect on a critical hit. This special effect functions against
      creatures not subject to critical hits, such as undead, elementals, and constructs. When fighting against such
      creatures, roll for critical hits as you would against humanoids or any other creature subject to critical hits.
      On a successful critical roll, apply the special effect, but do not multiply the weapon’s regular damage.

      energy weapon has its significant portion transformed into light, although this does not modify the item’s weight.
      It always gives off light as a torch (20-foot radius). A brilliant energy weapon ignores nonliving matter. Armor
      and shield bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the
      weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.) A
      brilliant energy weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, and objects. This property can only be applied to melee
      weapons, thrown weapons, and ammunition.

      weapon can be loosed to attack on its own. It fights for 4 rounds using the base attack bonus of the one who
      loosed it and then drops. While dancing, it cannot make attacks of opportunity, and the person who activated it is
      not considered armed with the weapon. In all other respects, it is considered wielded or attended by the creature
      for all maneuvers and effects that target items. While dancing, it takes up the same space as the activating
      character and can attack adjacent foes (weapons with reach can attack opponents up to 10 feet away). The dancing
      weapon accompanies the person who activated it everywhere, whether she moves by physical or magical means. If the
      wielder who loosed it has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it while it is attacking on its own as a free action;
      when so retrieved the weapon can’t dance (attack on its own) again for 4 rounds.

      by an incorporeal creature at any time. A manifesting ghost can wield the weapon against corporeal foes.
      Essentially, a ghost touch weapon counts as either corporeal or incorporeal at any given time, whichever is more

      weapon allows a spellcaster to store a single targeted spell of up to 3rd level in the weapon. (The spell must

      special ability is an exception to the general rule that casting a spell from an item takes at least as long as
      casting that spell normally.) Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast any other
      targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell
      currently stored within it. A randomly rolled spell storing weapon has a 50% chance to have a spell stored in it

      to confirm the critical hit), the weapon severs the opponent’s head (if it has one) from its body. Some creatures,
      such as many aberrations and all oozes, have no heads. Others, such as golems and undead creatures other than
      vampires, are not affected by the loss of their heads. Most other creatures, however, die when their heads are cut

      the wielder would otherwise take.
    </p>

      A <i>frost brand</i> extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. As a standard action, it can also dispel
      lasting fire spells, but not instantaneous effects, though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +14) against

      and constructs, who do not suffer its drawback. A <i>life-drinker</i> bestows two negative levels on its target

      luck bonus on all saving throws. Its possessor also gains the power of good fortune, usable once per day. This

      <i>wishes</i> (when randomly rolled, a <i>luck blade</i> holds 1d4–1 <i>wishes,</i> minimum 0). When the last
      <i>wish</i> is used, the sword remains a <i>+2 short sword,</i> still grants the +1 luck bonus, and still grants
      its reroll power.

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="specific-weapons--mace-of-terror">Mace of Terror:</strong> On command, this
      <i>+2 heavy mace</i> causes the wielder’s clothes and appearance to transform into an illusion of darkest horror
      such that living creatures in a 30-foot cone become panicked as if by a <i>fear</i> spell (Will DC 16 partial).
      They take a –2 morale penalty on saving throws, and they flee from the wielder. The wielder may use this ability
      up to three times per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>fear;</i> Price 38,552 gp; Cost 19,276 gp + 1,542 XP.

      rolls.
    </p>
    <p>No aura (nonmagical); Price 330 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="specific-weapons--nine-lives-stealer">Nine Lives Stealer:</strong> This longsword always performs as a
      <i>+2 longsword,</i> but it also has the power to draw the life force from an opponent. It can do this nine times
      before the ability is lost. At that point, the sword becomes a simple <i>+2 longsword</i> (with a hint of evil
      about it). A critical hit must be dealt for the sword’s death-dealing ability to function, and this weapon has no
      effect on creatures not subject to critical hits. The victim is entitled to a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid death.
      If the save is successful, the sword’s death-dealing ability does not function, no use of the ability is expended,
      and normal critical damage is determined. This sword is evil, and any good character attempting to wield it gains
      two negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the sword is in hand and disappear when the sword is
      no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way
      (including <i>restoration</i> spells) while the sword is wielded.

      Strong necromancy [evil]; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

    <p>
      <strong id="specific-weapons--oathbow">Oathbow:</strong> Of elven make, this white <i>+2 composite longbow</i> (+2
      Str bonus) whispers “Swift defeat to my enemies” in Elven when nocked and pulled. Once per day, if the firer
      swears aloud to slay her target (a free action), the bow’s whisper becomes the low shout “Swift death to those who
      have wronged me.” Against such a sworn enemy, the bow has a +5 enhancement bonus, and arrows launched from it deal
      an additional 2d6 points of damage (and x4 on a critical hit instead of the normal x3). However, the bow is
      treated as only a masterwork weapon against all foes other than the sworn enemy, and the wielder takes a –1
      penalty on attack rolls with any weapon other than the <i>oathbow.</i> These bonuses and penalties last for seven
      days or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wielder of the <i>oathbow,</i> whichever comes first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>oathbow</i> may only have one sworn enemy at a time. Once the wielder swears to slay a target, he cannot
      make a new oath until he has slain that target or seven days have passed. Even if the wielder slays the sworn
      enemy on the same day that he makes the oath, he cannot activate the <i>oathbow</i>’s special power again until 24
      hours have passed from the time he made the oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be an elf; Price 25,600 gp; Cost 13,100 gp +

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="specific-weapons--rapier-of-puncturing">Rapier of Puncturing:</strong> Three times per day, this
      <i>+2 wounding rapier</i> allows the wielder to make a touch attack with the weapon that deals 1d6 points of
      Constitution damage by draining blood. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the Constitution damage
      dealt by this weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>harm;</i> Price 50,320 gp; Cost 25,320 gp + 2,000 XP.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="specific-weapons--screaming-bolt">Screaming Bolt:</strong> One of these <i>+2 bolts</i> screams when
      fired, forcing all enemies of the wielder within 20 feet of the path of the bolt to succeed on a DC 14 Will save
      or become shaken. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
    </p>
    <p>

      <strong id="specific-weapons--shatterspike">Shatterspike:</strong> Wielders without the Improved Sunder feat use
      <i>Shatterspike</i> as a <i>+1 longsword</i> only; wielders with the Improved Sunder feat add a +4 bonus
      (including the sword’s +1 enhancement bonus) to the opposed roll when attempting to strike a foe’s weapon. If
      successful, <i>Shatterspike</i> deals 1d8+4 points of damage plus the wielder’s Strength modifier to the target
      weapon (the target weapon’s hardness must still be overcome with each hit). <i>Shatterspike</i> can damage weapons
      with an enhancement bonus of +4 or lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong evocation; CL 13th; Str 13, Craft Arms and Armor, Power Attack, Improved Sunder, <i>shatter</i>; Price

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="specific-weapons--shifters-sorrow">Shifter’s Sorrow:</strong> This <i>+1/+1 two-bladed sword</i> has
      blades of alchemical silver. The weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against any creature with the
      shapechanger subtype. When a shapechanger or a creature in an alternate form (such as a druid using wild shape) is
      struck by the weapon, it must make a DC 15 Will save or return to its natural form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Arms and Armor,
      <i>baleful polymorph;</i> Price 12,780 gp; Cost 6,780 gp + 480 XP; Weight 10 lb.

      <strong id="specific-weapons--silver-dagger-masterwork">Silver Dagger, Masterwork:</strong> This masterwork
      alchemical silver dagger is nonmagical. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
    </p>
    <p>No aura (nonmagical); Price 322 gp.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="specific-weapons--slaying-arrow">Slaying Arrow:</strong> This <i>+1 arrow</i> is keyed to a particular
      type or subtype of creature. If it strikes such a creature, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or die
      (or, in the case of unliving targets, be destroyed) instantly. Note that even creatures normally exempt from
      Fortitude saves (undead and constructs) are subject to this attack. When keyed to a living creature, this is a
      death effect (and thus <i>death ward</i> protects a target). To determine the type or subtype of creature the
      arrow is keyed to, roll on the table below.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>greater slaying arrow</i> functions just like a normal <i>slaying arrow,</i> but the DC to avoid the death
      effect is 23.
    </p>

      <strong id="specific-weapons--sleep-arrow">Sleep Arrow:</strong> This <i>+1 arrow</i> is painted white and has
      white fletching. If it strikes a foe so that it would normally deal damage, it instead bursts into magical energy
      that deals nonlethal damage (in the same amount as would be lethal damage) and forces the target to make a DC 11
      Will save or fall asleep.
    </p>
    <p>Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>sleep;</i> Price 132 gp; Cost 69 gp 5 sp + 5 XP.</p>

      <strong id="specific-weapons--sun-blade">Sun Blade:</strong> This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a
      <i>sun blade</i> is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. (In other words,
      the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and
      reacts as if the weapon were a short sword.) Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword
      with proficiency is proficient in the use of a <i>sun blade.</i> Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization
      in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a
      <i>+2 bastard sword.</i> Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane
      creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and x3 on a critical hit instead of the usual x2).
    </p>
    <p>
      The blade also has a special <i>sunlight</i> power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above
      her head while speaking a command word. The <i>sunblade</i> then sheds a bright yellow radiance that is like full
      daylight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet
      per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops
      swinging, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All
      <i>sun blades</i> are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level.
      The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded.
      This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including
      <i>restoration</i> spells) while the sword is wielded.

      hit points each time a negative level is bestowed on another. These temporary hit points last for 24 hours. One
      day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose a character
      level.

      enhancement bonus also applies on the Material Plane when the weapon is used against elementals.) It operates as a
      <i>+3 longsword</i> on the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane or when used against opponents native to either of
      those planes. On any other plane, or against any outsider, it functions as a

      (Will DC 16 negates, animals get a +5 bonus if currently under attack by the wielder or his allies), no two of
      which can be more than 30 feet apart. The wielder can use this effect up to three times per day. The wielder can
      communicate with the animals as if using a <i>speak with animals</i> spell. Animals making their saving throw are
      free of control, but they will not approach within 10 feet of the trident. The trident can be used up to three
