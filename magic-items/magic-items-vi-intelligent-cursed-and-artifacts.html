    <h2 id="intelligent-items">Intelligent Items</h2>
    <p>
      Magic items sometimes have intelligence of their own. Magically imbued with sentience, these items think and feel
      the same way characters do and should be treated as NPCs. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes
      extraordinary powers and special purposes. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to single-use items or those
      with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never
      intelligent.) In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intelligent items can actually be considered creatures because they have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
      scores. Treat them as constructs. Intelligent items often have the ability to illuminate their surroundings at
      will (as magic weapons do); many cannot see otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike most magic items, intelligent items can activate their own powers without waiting for a command word from
      their owner. Intelligent items act during their owner’s turn in the initiative order.
    </p>
    <h3 id="intelligent-item-alignment">Intelligent Item Alignment</h3>
    <p>
      Any item with intelligence has an alignment. Note that intelligent weapons already have alignments, either stated
      or by implication. If you’re generating a random intelligent weapon, that weapon’s alignment must fit with any
      alignment-oriented special abilities it has.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any character whose alignment does not correspond to that of the item (except as noted by the asterisks on the
      table) gains one negative level if he or she so much as picks up the item. Although this negative level never
      results in actual level loss, it remains as long as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way
      (including
      <i>restoration</i> spells). This negative level is cumulative with any other penalties the item might already
      place on inappropriate wielders. Items with Ego scores (see below) of 20 to 29 bestow two negative levels. Items
      with Ego scores of 30 or higher bestow three negative levels.

    <h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      An item’s purpose must suit the type and alignment of the item and should always be treated reasonably. A purpose
      of “defeat/slay arcane spellcasters” doesn’t mean that the sword forces the wielder to kill every wizard she sees.
      Nor does it mean that the sword believes it is possible to kill every wizard, sorcerer, and bard in the world. It
      does mean that the item hates arcane spellcasters and wants to bring the local wizard’s cabal to ruin, as well as
      end the rule of a sorceress-queen in a nearby land. Likewise, a purpose of “defend elves” doesn’t mean that if the
      wielder is an elf, he only wants to help himself. It means that the item wants to be used in furthering the cause
      of elves, stamping out their enemies and aiding their leaders. A purpose of “defeat/slay all” isn’t just a matter
      of self-preservation. It means that the item won’t rest (or let its wielder rest) until it places itself above all
      others.
    </p>
    <h3 id="dedicated-power">Dedicated Power</h3>
    <p>
      A dedicated power operates only when an intelligent item is in pursuit of its special purpose. This determination
      is always made by the item. It should always be easy and straightforward to see how the ends justify the means.
      Unlike its other powers, an intelligent item can refuse to use its dedicated power even if the owner is dominant
      (see Items against Characters, below).

    <h3 id="item-ego">Item Ego</h3>
    <p>
      Ego is a measure of the total power and force of personality that an item possesses. Only after all aspects of an
      item have been generated can its Ego score be calculated. An item’s Ego score helps determine whether the item or
      the character is dominant in their relationship, as detailed below.

    <h3 id="items-against-characters">Items Against Characters</h3>
    <p>
      When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is, of course, absolutely true to its
      alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment’s goals or the item’s special
      purpose, personality conflict—item against character—results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or
      higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does
      not always agree with the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw (DC = item’s Ego). If the
      possessor succeeds, she is dominant. If she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for one day or until a
      critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to either the item or the character, and so
      on). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character’s desires and demands concessions such as any of the
      following.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.</li>
      <li>The character divesting herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.</li>
      <li>Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.</li>
      <li>Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.</li>
      <li>Magical protections and devices to protect the item from molestation when it is not in use.</li>
      <li>That the character carry the item with her on all occasions.</li>
      <li>
        That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or
        conduct.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures, such as the following acts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Force its possessor into combat.</li>
      <li>Refuse to strike opponents.</li>
      <li>Strike at its wielder or her associates.</li>
      <li>Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.</li>
      <li>Cause itself to drop from the character’s grasp.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character’s and item’s alignments or when
      their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess
      it in order to easily establish and maintain dominance over him, or a higher-level possessor so as to better
      accomplish its goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way,
      particularly combat. Such items are rivals of each other, even if they are of the same alignment. No intelligent
      item wants to share its wielder with others. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent
      item within 60 feet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract their host so that she
      ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might change this sort of behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters who possess them, even though
      they may never successfully control their possessors. They may be powerless to force their demands but remain
      undaunted and continue to air their wishes and demands.
    </p>
    <h2 id="cursed-items">Cursed Items</h2>
    <p>
      Cursed items are magic items with some sort of potentially negative impact. Sometimes they’re directly bad for the
      user; sometimes they’re just inconvenient. Occasionally they mix bad with good, forcing characters to make
      difficult choices.

    <p>
      <strong>Delusion:</strong> The user believes the item is what it appears to be, yet it actually has no magical
      power other than to deceive. The user is mentally fooled into thinking the item is functioning and cannot be
      convinced otherwise without the help of a <i>remove curse</i> spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Opposite Effect or Target:</strong> These cursed items malfunction, so that either they do the opposite of
      what the creator intended, or they target the user instead of someone else. The interesting point to keep in mind
      here is that these items aren’t always bad to have. Opposite-effect items include weapons that impose penalties on
      attack and damage rolls rather than bonuses. Just as a character shouldn’t necessarily immediately know what the
      enhancement bonus of a noncursed magic item is, she shouldn’t immediately know that a weapon is cursed. Once she
      knows, however, the item can be discarded unless some sort of compulsion is placed upon it that compels the
      wielder to keep and use it. In such cases, a <i>remove curse</i> spell is generally needed to get rid of the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Intermittent Functioning:</strong> The three varieties of intermittent functioning items all function
      perfectly as described—at least some of the time. The three varieties are unreliable, dependent, and uncontrolled
      items.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Unreliable:</em> Each time the item is activated, there is a 5% chance (01–05 on d%) that it does not
      function.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Dependent:</em> The item only functions in certain situations. To determine what the situation is, either
      select a situation or roll on the following table.

    <p>
      <em>Uncontrolled:</em> An uncontrolled item occasionally activates at random times. Roll d% every day. On a result
      of 01–05 the item activates at some random point during that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Requirement:</strong> In a sense, a command word is a requirement. Nevertheless, some items have much more
      stringent requirements that must be met for them to be usable. To keep an item with this kind of curse
      functioning, one or more of the following conditions must be met.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Character must eat twice as much as normal.</li>
      <li>Character must sleep twice as much as normal.</li>
      <li>Character must undergo a specific quest (one time only, and then item functions normally thereafter).</li>
      <li>Character must sacrifice (destroy) 100 gp worth of valuables per day.</li>
      <li>Character must sacrifice (destroy) 2,000 gp worth of magic items each week.</li>
      <li>Character must swear fealty to a particular noble or his family.</li>
      <li>Character must discard all other magic items.</li>
      <li>Character must worship a particular deity.</li>
      <li>Character must change her name to a specific name. (The item only works for characters of that name.)</li>
      <li>Character must add a specific class at the next opportunity if not of that class already.</li>
      <li>Character must have a minimum number of ranks in a particular skill.</li>
      <li>
        Character must sacrifice some part of her life energy (2 points of Constitution) one time. If the character gets
        the Constitution points back (such as from a <i>restoration</i> spell), the item ceases functioning. (The item
        does not cease functioning if the character receives a Constitution increase caused by level gain, a
        <i>wish,</i> or the use of a magic item.)
      </li>
      <li>Item must be cleansed with holy water each day.</li>
      <li>Item must be used to kill a living creature each day.</li>
      <li>Item must be bathed in volcanic lava once per month.</li>
      <li>Item must be used at least once a day, or it won’t function again for its current possessor.</li>
      <li>
        Item must draw blood when wielded (weapons only). It can’t be put away or exchanged for another weapon until it
        has scored a hit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Item must have a particular spell cast upon it each day (such as
        <i>bless, atonement,</i> or <i>animate objects</i>).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Requirements are so dependent upon suitability to the item that they should never be determined randomly. An item
      with a requirement that is also intelligent often imposes its requirement through its personality. If the
      requirement is not met, the item ceases to function. If it is met, usually the item functions for one day before
      the requirement must be met again (although some requirements are one time only, others monthly, and still others
      continuous).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Drawback:</strong> Items with drawbacks are usually still beneficial to the possessor but they also carry
      some negative aspect. Although sometimes drawbacks occur only when the item is used (or held, in the case of some
      items such as weapons), usually the drawback remains with the character for as long as she has the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roll on the table below to generate a drawback that (unless otherwise indicated) remains in effect as long as the
      item is in the character’s possession.

    <p>
      Specific Cursed Items are provided as examples of cursed items. They are given creation prerequisites, should
      someone want to intentionally create them (although that does not need to be the origin of the item). Note,
      however, two exceptions: The <i>crystal hypnosis ball</i> and the <i>bag of devouring</i> cannot be created by any
      known means.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple <i>detect magic</i> spell yields a misleading aura and strength, often indicating that the item is a
      noncursed item of similar sort. An <i>identify</i> spell only has a 1% chance per caster level to reveal a cursed
      item’s true properties, including the cursed aspect. <i>Analyze dweomer</i> reveals the true nature of a cursed
      item.

      <strong>Amulet of Inescapable Location:</strong> This device is typically worn on a chain or as a brooch. It
      appears, to magical analysis, to prevent location, scrying or detection or influence by <i>detect thoughts</i> or
      telepathy. It seems to be an <i>amulet of proof against detection and location</i>. Actually, the amulet gives the
      wearer a –10 penalty on all saves against divination spells.

      Moderate abjuration; CL 10th; Create Wondrous Item,
      <i>bestow curse;</i> Price 1,000 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Armor of Arrow Attraction:</strong> Magical analysis indicates that this armor is a normal suit of
      <i>+3 full plate.</i> However, the armor is cursed. It works normally with regard to melee attacks but actually
      serves to attract ranged weapons. The wearer takes a –15 penalty to AC against any attack by a ranged weapon. The
      true nature of the armor does not reveal itself until the character is fired upon in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong abjuration; CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>bestow curse;</i> Price 9,000 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Armor of Rage:</strong> This armor is similar in appearance to <i>armor of command</i> and functions as a
      suit of <i>+1 full plate</i>. However, when it is worn, the armor causes the character to take a –4 penalty to
      Charisma. All unfriendly characters within 300 feet have a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against her. The effect
      is not noticeable to the wearer or those affected. (In other words, the wearer does not immediately notice that
      donning the armor is the cause of her problems, nor do foes understand the reason for the depth of their enmity.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong necromancy; CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>bestow curse;</i> Price 1,600 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bag of Devouring:</strong> This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for magical properties makes
      it seem as if it were a <i>bag of holding</i>. The sack is, however, a lure used by an extradimensional
      creature—in fact, one of its feeding orifices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to “swallowing’’ if thrust within the bag. The
      <i>bag of devouring</i> is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but any time thereafter that it senses
      living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close
      around the offending member and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on grapple checks made
      to pull someone in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a
      <i>bag of holding type I,</i> but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then
      spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round.
      The bag destroys the victim’s body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the
      corpse. There is a 50% chance that a <i>wish, miracle,</i> or <i>true resurrection</i> spell can restore a
      devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be
      brought back to life by mortal magic.
    </p>
    <p>Moderate conjuration; CL 17th; In effect, this is a creature and cannot be created; Price n/a.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Boots of Dancing:</strong> These boots initially appear and function as one of the other kinds of magic
      boots. But when the wearer is in (or fleeing from) melee combat, <i>boots of dancing</i> impede movement, making
      him behave as if <i>irresistible dance</i> had been cast upon him. Only a <i>remove curse</i> spell enables the
      wearer to be rid of the boots once their true nature is revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong enchantment; CL 16th; Create Wondrous Item,
      <i>irresistible dance;</i> Price 30,000 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bracers of Defenselessness:</strong> These appear to be <i>bracers of armor +5</i> and actually serve as
      such until the wearer is attacked in anger by an enemy with a Challenge Rating equal to or greater than her level.
      At that moment and thereafter, the bracers cause a –5 penalty to AC. Once their curse is activated,
      <i>bracers of defenselessness</i> can be removed only by means of a <i>remove curse</i> spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moderate conjuration; CL 16th; Create Wondrous Item,
      <i>mage armor, bestow curse;</i> Price 1,200 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Broom of Animated Attack:</strong> This item is indistinguishable in appearance from a normal broom. It is
      identical to a <i>broom of flying</i> by all tests short of attempted use.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a command is spoken, the broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, dumping him on his head from 1d4+5
      feet off the ground (no falling damage, since the fall is less than 10 feet). The broom then attacks the victim,
      swatting the face with the straw or twig end and beating him with the handle end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broom gets two attacks per round with each end (two swats with the straw and two with the handle, for a total
      of four attacks per round). It attacks with a +5 bonus on each attack roll. The straw end causes a victim to be
      blinded for 1 round when it hits. The handle deals 1d6 points of damage when it hits. The broom has AC 13, 18 hit
      points, and hardness 4.

      <strong>Cloak of Poisonousness:</strong> This cloak is usually made of a woolen material, although it can be made
      of leather. A <i>detect poison</i> spell can reveal the presence of poison impregnated in the cloak’s fabric. The
      garment can be handled without harm, but as soon as it is actually donned the wearer is killed instantly unless
      she succeeds on a DC 28 Fortitude save.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once donned, a <i>cloak of poisonousness</i> can be removed only with a <i>remove curse</i> spell; doing this
      destroys the magical property of the cloak. If a <i>neutralize poison</i> spell is then used, it is possible to
      revive the victim with a <i>raise dead</i> or <i>resurrection</i> spell, but not before.

      <strong>Crystal Hypnosis Ball:</strong> This cursed item is indistinguishable from a normal
      <i>crystal ball.</i> However, anyone attempting to use the scrying device becomes fascinated for 1d6 minutes, and
      a telepathic <i>suggestion</i> is implanted in his mind (Will DC 19 negates).
    </p>
    <p>
      The user of the device believes that the desired creature or scene was viewed, but actually he came under the
      influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or even some power or being from another plane. Each further use brings the
      <i>crystal hypnosis ball</i> gazer deeper under the influence of the controller, either as a servant or a tool.
      Note that throughout this time, the user remains unaware of his subjugation.

      DC 15 Fortitude save take 2d6 points of Constitution damage immediately. In addition, those failing a second DC 15
      Fortitude save 1 minute later are dealt 1d6 points of Constitution damage. Those who succeed on either saving

      make a DC 17 Will save or be cursed, taking a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until a

      suitable for use with armor. In the former instance, they appear to be <i>gloves of Dexterity.</i> In the latter
      case, they appear to be <i>gauntlets of ogre power.</i> The gauntlets perform according to every test as if they
      were <i>gloves of Dexterity</i> or <i>gauntlets of ogre power</i> until the wearer finds herself under attack or
      in a life-and-death situation. At that time, the curse is activated. The wearer becomes fumble-fingered, with a
      50% chance each round of dropping anything held in either hand. The gauntlets also lower Dexterity by 2 points.
      Once the curse is activated, the gloves can be removed only by means of a <i>remove curse</i> spell, a
      <i>wish,</i> or a <i>miracle.</i>

      <strong>Helm of Opposite Alignment:</strong> This metal hat looks like a typical helmet. When placed upon the
      head, however, its curse immediately takes effect (Will DC 15 negates). On a failed save, the alignment of the
      wearer is radically altered to an alignment as different as possible from the former alignment—good to evil,
      chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration in alignment is mental as
      well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds
      on his save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it off and
      later puts it on again, another save is required. The curse only works once; that is, a character whose alignment
      has been changed cannot change it again by donning the helmet a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i> can restore former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any
      attempt to return to the former alignment. (In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way
      possible.) If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an <i>atonement</i> spell is
      needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a <i>helm of opposite alignment</i> has functioned once, it
      loses its magical properties.

      the user to become totally confident that her spell ability is superior, due to the magic incense. The user is

      15 Will save to sort out. However, while the user thinks she is picking up the thoughts of others, all she is
      really hearing are figments created by the medallion itself. These illusory thoughts always seem plausible and
      thus can seriously mislead any who rely upon them. What’s worse, unknown to her, the cursed medallion actually
      broadcasts her thoughts to creatures in the path of the beam, thus alerting them to her presence.

      only be identified as a cursed item when placed around a character’s neck. The necklace immediately constricts,
      dealing 6 points of damage per round. It cannot be removed by any means short of a <i>limited wish, wish,</i> or
      <i>miracle</i> and remains clasped around the victim’s throat even after his death. Only when he has decayed to a

      drains 1 point of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be
      removed only by application of a <i>remove curse</i> spell followed by a <i>cure disease</i> and then a
      <i>heal, miracle, limited wish</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing a

      <strong>Robe of Vermin:</strong> The wearer notices nothing unusual when the robe is donned, other than that it
      offers great magical defense (as a <i>cloak of protection +4</i>). However, as soon as he is in a situation
      requiring concentration and action against hostile opponents, the true nature of the garment is revealed: The
      wearer immediately suffers a multitude of bites from the insects that magically infest the garment. He must cease
      all other activities in order to scratch, shift the robe, and generally show signs of the extreme discomfort
      caused by the bites and movement of these pests.

      The wearer takes a –5 penalty on initiative checks and a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks.

      <strong>Scarab of Death:</strong> This small pin appears to be any one of the various beneficial amulets,

      it changes into a horrible burrowing beetlelike creature. The thing tears through any leather or cloth, burrows
      into flesh, and reaches the victim’s heart in 1 round, causing death. A DC 25 Reflex save allows the wearer to
      tear the scarab away before it burrows out of sight, but he still takes 3d6 points of damage. The beetle then
      returns to its scarab form. Placing the scarab in a container of wood, ceramic, bone, ivory, or metal prevents the
      monster from coming to life and allows for long-term storage of the item.

      <strong>Spear, Cursed Backbiter:</strong> This is a <i>+2 shortspear,</i> but each time it is used in melee

      curse takes effect, the spear curls around to strike its wielder in the back, automatically dealing the damage to
      the wielder. The curse even functions when the spear is hurled, and in such a case the damage to the hurler is

      All damage dealt is also reduced by 2 points, but never below a minimum of 1 point of damage on any successful

      <strong>Book of Infinite Spells:</strong> This work bestows upon any character of any class the ability to use the
      spells within its pages. However, any character not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as
      long as the book is in her possession or while she uses its power. A <i>book of infinite spells</i> contains
      1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a dice roll: 01–50, arcane spell; 51–100, divine spell.
    </p>
    <p>Determine the exact spell by using the tables for determining major scroll spells.</p>
    <p>
      Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back—paging through a
      <i>book of infinite spells</i> is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was
      on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one
      that is on the character’s class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped
      out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as scroll spells, nor can they be copied
      into a spellbook—their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its power. The book can be stored in a
      place of safety while the owner is adventuring and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically
      turn despite all precautions. The owner knows this and may even benefit from the turning by gaining access to a
      new spell. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the
      owner is.

      <strong>Deck of Many Things:</strong> A <i>deck of many things</i> (both beneficial and baneful) is usually found
      in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is
      engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is
      bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character with a <i>deck of many things</i> who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will
      draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never again draw from
      this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or
      if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. <i>Exception:</i> If the
      jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw two additional cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless
      the draw is the jester or the fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A
      <i>deck of many things</i> contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as
      indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary

      <em>Balance:</em> The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act
      according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Comet:</em> The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the
      benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Donjon:</em> This card signifies imprisonment— either by the <i>imprisonment</i> spell or by some powerful
      being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Euryale:</em> The medusalike visage of this card brings a curse that only the fates card or a deity can
      remove. The –1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Fates:</em> This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the
      fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop
      something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card;
      other party members may have to endure the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Flames:</em> Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity.
      The enmity of the outsider can’t be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider
      randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Fool:</em> The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike
      all others except the jester.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Gem:</em> This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, the
      gems 1,000 gp value each.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Idiot:</em> This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is
      optional.
    </p>

      <em>Jester:</em> This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the fool. The redraws are
      optional.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Key:</em> The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in
      the character’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Knight:</em> The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race
      (or kind) and gender as the character.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Moon:</em> This card sometimes bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of
      <i>wishes</i> shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of
      <i>wishes</i> (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These <i>wishes</i> are the same as those
      granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Rogue:</em> When this card is drawn, one of the character’s NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally
      alienated and forever after
    </p>
    <p>
      hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order)
      can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Ruin:</em> As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Skull:</em> A dread wraith appears. Treat this creature as an unturnable undead. The character must fight it
      alone—if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and
      cannot be revived, even with a <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Star:</em> The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two
      abilities.
    </p>
    <p><em>Sun:</em> Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Talons:</em> When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and
      irrevocably gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Throne:</em> The character becomes a true leader in people’s eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area
      she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Vizier:</em> This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of
      wisdom to solve any
    </p>
    <p>
      single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within one year.
      Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another question entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>The Void:</em> This black card spells instant disaster. The character’s body continues to function, as though
      comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere—in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the
      possession of an outsider. A <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i> does not bring the character back, instead merely
      revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards.

      <strong>Hammer of Thunderbolts:</strong> This <i>+3 Large returning warhammer</i> deals 4d6 points of damage on
      any hit. Further, if the wielder wears a <i>belt of giant Strength</i> and <i>gauntlets of ogre power</i> and he
      knows that the hammer is a <i>hammer of thunderbolts</i> (not just a <i>+3 warhammer</i>), the weapon can be used
      to full effect: It gains a total +5 enhancement bonus, allows all <i>belt</i> and <i>gauntlet</i> bonuses to stack
      (only when using this weapon), and strikes dead any giant upon whom it scores a hit (Fortitude DC 20 negates the
      death effect but not the damage).
    </p>
    <p>
      When hurled, on a successful attack the hammer emits a great noise, like a clap of thunder, causing all creatures
      within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 negates). The hammer’s range increment is 30 feet.

      <strong>Philosopher’s Stone:</strong> This rare substance appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of blackish rock.
      If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is revealed at the stone’s heart. This cavity is lined with a
      magical type of quicksilver that enables any arcane spellcaster to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into
      silver and gold. A single <i>philosopher’s stone</i> can turn from up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver, or up
      to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold. However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses
      its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any
      <i>cure</i> potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special <i>oil of life</i> that acts as a
      <i>true resurrection</i> spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon.

      <strong>Sphere of Annihilation:</strong> A <i>sphere of annihilation</i> is a globe of absolute blackness, a ball
      of nothingness 2 feet in diameter. The object is actually a hole in the continuity of the multiverse. Any matter
      that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void, gone, and utterly destroyed. Only the
      direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>sphere of annihilation</i> is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to
      move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects
      but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character’s ability to gain control of a
      <i>sphere of annihilation</i> (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30
      (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds, the
      character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely).
      Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round.
      For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the
      sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere’s speed in a round is 10 feet +5 feet
      for every 5 points by which the character’s control check result in that round exceeded 30.
    </p>
    <p>If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it.</p>
    <p>
      If two or more creatures vie for control of a
      <i>sphere of annihilation,</i> the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who
      rolled lowest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should a <i>gate</i> spell be cast upon a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, there is a 50% chance (01–50 on d%) that
      the spell destroys it, a 35% chance (51–85) that the spell does nothing, and a 15% chance (86–100) that a gap is
      torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything within a 180-foot radius into another plane. If a
      <i>rod of cancellation</i> touches a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>,
    </p>
    <p>
      they negate each other in a tremendous explosion. Everything within a 60-foot radius takes 2d6x10 points of
      damage. <i>Dispel</i>
    </p>
    <p><i>magic</i> and <i>mage’s disjunction</i> have no effect on a sphere.</p>

      <strong>Staff of the Magi:</strong> A long wooden staff, shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes of all
      types, this potent artifact contains many spell powers and other functions. Some of its powers use charges, while
      others don’t. The following powers do not use charges:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Detect magic</i></li>
      <li><i>Enlarge person</i> (Fortitude DC 15 negates)</li>
      <li><i>Hold portal</i></li>
      <li><i>Light</i></li>
      <li><i>Mage armor</i></li>
      <li><i>Mage hand</i></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following powers drain 1 charge per usage:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Dispel magic</i></li>
      <li><i>Fireball</i> (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half )</li>
      <li><i>Ice storm</i></li>
      <li><i>Invisibility</i></li>
      <li><i>Knock</i></li>
      <li><i>Lightning bolt</i> (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half )</li>
      <li><i>Passwall</i></li>
      <li><i>Pyrotechnics</i> (Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates)</li>
      <li><i>Wall of fire</i></li>
      <li><i>Web</i></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These powers drain 2 charges per usage:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Monster summoning IX</i></li>
      <li><i>Plane shift</i> (Will DC 21 negates)</li>
      <li><i>Telekinesis</i> (400 lb. maximum weight; Will DC 19 negates)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A <i>staff of the magi</i> gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff
      can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a <i>rod of absorption</i> does. Unlike
      the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a
      spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a
      retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her,
      for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a <i>rod of absorption</i> does. (Thus, absorbing spells can
      be risky.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Retributive Strike:</em> A <i>staff of the magi</i> can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an act must
      be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All within
      10 feet of the broken staff take hit points of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those
      between 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number of charges, and those 21 feet to 30 feet
      distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 17 Reflex save reduces damage by half.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance (01–50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence, but if
      she does not (51–100), the explosive release of spell energy destroys her. Only specific items, including the
      <i>staff of the magi</i> and the <i>staff of power</i> are capable of a retributive strike.

      <strong>Talisman of Pure Good:</strong> A good (LG, NG, CG) divine spellcaster who possesses this item can cause a
      flaming crack to open at the feet of an evil (LE, NE, CE) divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away. The
      intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman
      must be good, and if he is not exceptionally pure in thought and deed the evil character gains a DC 19 Reflex
      saving throw to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to
      function.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>talisman of pure good</i> has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these
      stones, he takes 6d6 points of damage. If an evil divine spellcaster touches one, he takes 8d6 points of damage.
      All other characters are unaffected by the device.

      <strong>Talisman of the Sphere:</strong> This small adamantine loop and handle are useless to those unable to cast
      arcane spells. Characters
    </p>
    <p>
      who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding a talisman of this
      sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a
      <i>sphere of annihilation,</i> a <i>talisman of the sphere</i> doubles the character’s modifier on his control
      check (doubling both his Intelligence bonus and his character level for this purpose).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he need check for maintaining control only every other round
      thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of
      cancellation have no effect upon a
      <i>sphere of annihilation,</i> the talisman’s power of control can be suppressed or canceled.

      <strong>Talisman of Reluctant Wishes:</strong> A talisman of this sort appears the same as a
      <i>stone of controlling earth elementals.</i> Its powers are quite different, however, and dependent on the
      Charisma of the individual holding the talisman. Whenever a character touches a
      <i>talisman of reluctant wishes,</i> he must make a DC 15 Charisma check.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he fails, the device acts as a <i>stone of weight</i>. Discarding or destroying it results in 5d6 points of
      damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a <i>wish</i> is made with it,
      whichever comes first. It then disappears.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he rolls a natural 20, the character finds it impossible to be rid of the talisman for as many months as he has
      points of Charisma. In addition, the artifact grants him one <i>wish</i> for every 6 points of the character’s
      Charisma. It also grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap.
      (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of which reaction results, a
      <i>talisman of reluctant wishes</i> disappears when its time period expires, leaving behind a 10,000 gp diamond in
      its stead.

      <strong>Talisman of Ultimate Evil:</strong> An evil (LE, NE, CE) divine spellcaster who possesses this item can
      cause a flaming crack to open at the feet of a good (LG, NG, CG) divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away.
      The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the
      talisman must be evil, and if she is not exceptionally foul and perverse in the sights of her evil deity the good
      character gains a DC 19 Reflex save to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid
      ground for this item to function.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>talisman of ultimate evil</i> has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these

      Unlike all other magic items, major artifacts are not easily destroyed. Each should have only a single, specific

      <strong>The Moaning Diamond:</strong> The <i>Moaning Diamond</i> appears to be an uncut diamond the size of a
      human fist. At all times, it gives forth a baleful moaning sound, as if in pain. Despite the noise, the
      <i>Moaning Diamond</i> is not evil. The wielder of the stone can, three times per day, call upon it to reshape
      earth and stone as if by the spell <i>stone shape,</i> affecting 5,000 cubic feet of material. The
      <i>Moaning Diamond</i> can summon an elder earth elemental with maximum hit points that serves the caster until it
      is slain. Only one such elemental can be summoned at a time; if it is slain, a new creature cannot be summoned for

      The bearer of an <i>Orb</i> can <i>dominate</i> dragons of its particular variety within 500 feet (as

      useful against this effect.) Each <i>Orb of Dragonkind</i> bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw
      bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether
      they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the
      <i>Orb.</i> A character possessing an <i>Orb of Dragonkind</i> is immune to the breath weapon—but only the breath
      weapon—of the dragon variety keyed to the <i>Orb.</i> Finally, a character possessing an <i>Orb</i> can herself
      use the breath weapon of the dragon in the <i>Orb</i> three times per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      All <i>Orbs of Dragonkind</i> can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other
      <i>Orbs.</i> The owner of an <i>Orb</i> knows whether there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons
      of the <i>Orb</i>’s particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the <i>Orb</i>’s
      variety, the wielder can determine the exact location and age of the creature. The bearer of one of these
      <i>Orbs</i> earns the enmity forever of all dragonkind for profiting by the enslavement of one of their kin, even
      if she later loses the item.
    </p>
    <p>Each <i>Orb</i> also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at 10th caster level.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Black Dragon Orb: Fly</i> (Will DC 17 negates).</li>
      <li><i>Blue Dragon Orb: Haste</i> (Fortitude DC 17 negates).</li>
      <li><i>Brass Dragon Orb: Teleport</i> (Will DC 19 negates).</li>
      <li><i>Bronze Dragon Orb: Scrying</i> (Will DC 18 negates).</li>
      <li><i>Copper Dragon Orb: Suggestion</i> (Will DC 17 negates).</li>
      <li>
        <i>Gold Dragon Orb:</i> The owner of the gold <i>Orb</i> can call upon any power possessed by one of the other
        <i>Orbs</i>—including the <i>dominate</i> and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon
        immunity—but can only use an individual
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      power once per day. She can use <i>dominate</i> on any other possessor of an <i>Orb</i> within 1 mile (Will DC 23
      negates).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Green Dragon Orb: Spectral hand.</i></li>
      <li><i>Red Dragon Orb: Wall of fire.</i></li>
      <li><i>Silver Dragon Orb: Cure critical wounds</i> (Will DC 18 half ).</li>
      <li><i>White Dragon Orb: Protection from energy (cold)</i> (Fortitude DC 17 negates).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>The Saint’s Mace:</strong> This relic appears to be a simple, well-used cudgel, but its simple appearance
      hides great power. The <i>saint’s mace</i> has a +5 enhancement bonus and functions as a heavy mace with the holy,
      lawful, and disruption special abilities. The wielder can project <i>searing light</i> from the mace at will, at
      caster level 20th.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Shadowstaff:</strong> This artifact was crafted centuries ago, weaving together the wispy strands of
      shadow itself into a twisted black staff. The <i>Shadowstaff</i> makes the wielder slightly shadowy and
      incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to AC and Reflex saves (which stacks with any other bonuses). However, in
      bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a –2 penalty on
      all attack rolls, saves, and checks.
    </p>
    <p>The <i>Shadowstaff</i> also has these powers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Summon Shadows:</i> Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the
        wielder as if called by a <i>summon monster V</i> spell cast at 20th level.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Summon Nightshade:</i> Once per month, the staff can summon a nightcrawler nightshade that serves the wielder
        as if called by a <i>summon monster IX</i> spell cast at 20th level.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Shadow Form:</i> Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers
        granted by the <i>gaseous form</i> spell.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Shadow Bolt:</i> Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage
        to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Shield of the Sun: This <i>+5 large shield,</i> emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to
      cast spells as if she were a 20th-level paladin with a Wisdom score of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with
      any existing spells per day that the character might have, even if she’s already a paladin. The
      <i>Shield of the Sun</i> also grants spell resistance 15 to its wielder. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage
      from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the
      shield’s owner must undertake a quest (no saving throw to avoid) at the behest of a lawful good deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character who is evil or chaotic (LE, NE, CE, CN, CG) gains four negative levels if she attempts to use this
      artifact. Although these negative levels never results in actual level loss, they remain as long as the shield is
      in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including
      <i>restoration</i> spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer’s
      possession.
