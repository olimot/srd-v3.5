The chromatic dragons are black, blue, green, red, and white; they are all evil and extremely fierce. The metallic dragons are brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver; they are all good, usually noble, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>All true dragons gain more abilities and greater power as they age. (Other creatures that have the dragon type do not.) They range in length from several feet upon hatching to more than 100 feet after attaining the status of great wyrm. The size of a particular dragon varies according to age and variety.</p><p>A dragon’s metabolism operates like a highly efficient furnace and can metabolize even inorganic material. Some dragons have developed a taste for such fare.</p><p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons, there is no such thing as enough treasure. It’s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. By the time a dragon matures to the age of great wyrm, hundreds of gems and coins may be imbedded in its hide.</p><p>All dragons speak Draconic.</p><section id="h2-2-combat"><h2>COMBAT</h2><p>A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, and can also use a breath weapon and special physical attacks, depending on its size. It prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the enemy with ranged attacks. Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first (or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).</p><p>The table below provides space and reach statistics for dragons of various sizes, plus the natural weapons a dragon of a certain size can employ and the damage those attacks deal.</p><p><strong>Bite:</strong> Bite attacks deal the indicated damage plus the dragon’s Strength bonus. A dragon also can use its bite to snatch opponents if it has the Snatch feat.</p><p><strong>Claw:</strong> Claw attacks deal the indicated damage plus 1/2 the dragon’s Strength bonus (round down). The dragon also can use its claws to snatch opponents if it has the Snatch feat. Claw attacks are secondary attacks, requiring a –5 penalty on the attack roll. (Many dragons choose the Multiattack feat to lessen this penalty to –2).</p><p><strong>Wing:</strong> The dragon can slam opponents with its wings, even when flying. Wing attacks deal the indicated damage plus 1/2 the dragon’s Strength bonus (round down) and are treated as secondary attacks.</p><p><strong>Tail Slap:</strong> The dragon can slap one opponent each round with its tail. A tail slap deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon’s Strength bonus (round down) and is treated as a secondary attack.</p><p><strong>Crush (Ex):</strong> This special attack allows a flying or jumping dragon of at least Huge size to land on opponents as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon (though it can attempt normal overrun or grapple attacks against larger opponents).</p><p>A crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under the dragon’s body. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon’s breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each round if they don’t escape.</p><p>A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon’s Strength bonus (round down).</p><p><strong>Tail Sweep (Ex):</strong> This special attack allows a dragon of at least Gargantuan size to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The <span style="font-size: 12px;">sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending from an </span>intersection on the edge of the dragon’s space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are four or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon’s Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the dragon’s breath weapon).</p><p><strong>Grappling:</strong> Dragons do not favor grapple attacks, though their crush attack (and Snatch feat, if they know it) use normal grapple rules. A dragon can always use its breath weapon while grappling, as well as its spells and spell-like or supernatural abilities, provided it succeeds on Concentration checks.</p><p><strong>Breath Weapon (Su):</strong> Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can’t breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. If a dragon has more than one type of breath weapon, it still can breathe only once every 1d4 rounds. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at any intersection adjacent to the dragon and extends in a direction of the dragon’s choice, with an area as noted on the table below. If the breath weapon deals damage, creatures caught in the area can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage; the DC depends on the dragon’s age and variety, and is given in each individual entry. Saves against nondamaging breath weapons use the same DC; the kind of saving throw is noted in the variety descriptions. The save DC against a breath weapon is 10 + 1/2 dragon’s HD + dragon’s Con modifier.</p><p>Breath weapons come in two basic shapes, line and cone, whose areas vary with the dragon’s size.</p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td colspan="3" style="font-weight: 700;">Dragon Breath Weapons</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Dragon Size</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Line* (Length)</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Cone** (Length)</td></tr><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>30 ft.</td><td>15 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>40 ft.</td><td>20 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>60 ft.</td><td>30 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>80 ft.</td><td>40 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>100 ft.</td><td>50 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>120 ft.</td><td>60 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>140 ft.</td><td>70 ft.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">*A line is always 5 feet high and 5 feet wide.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">**A cone is as high and wide as its length.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Frightful Presence (Ex):</strong> A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet x the dragon’s age category are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragon. A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 dragon’s HD + dragon’s Cha modifier) remains immune to that dragon’s frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or less HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.</p><p><strong>Spells:</strong> A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a sorcerer of the level indicated in its variety description, gaining bonus spells for a high Charisma score. Some dragons can also cast spells from the cleric list or cleric domain lists as arcane spells.</p><p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> A dragon’s spell-like abilities depend on its age and variety. It gains the abilities indicated for its age plus all previous ones. Its age category or its sorcerer caster level, whichever is higher, is the caster level for these abilities. The save DC is 10 + dragon’s Cha modifier + spell level. All spell-like abilities are usable once per day unless otherwise noted.</p><p><strong>Damage Reduction:</strong> Young adult and older dragons have damage reduction. Their natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><strong>Immunities (Ex):</strong> All dragons have immunity to <i>sleep</i> and paralysis effects. Each variety of dragon has immunity to one or two additional forms of attack no matter what its age, as given in its description.</p><p><strong>Spell Resistance (Ex):</strong> As dragons age, they become more resistant to spells and spell-like abilities, as indicated in the variety descriptions.</p><p><strong>Blindsense (Ex):</strong> Dragons can pinpoint creatures within a distance of 60 feet. Opponents the dragon can’t actually see still have total concealment against the dragon.</p><p><strong>Keen Senses (Ex):</strong> A dragon sees four times as well a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal light. It also has darkvision out to 120 feet.</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> All dragons have skill points equal to (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (Hit Dice + 3). Most dragons purchase the following skills at the maximum ranks possible: Listen, Search, and Spot. The remaining skill points are generally spent on Concentration, Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Intimidate, Knowledge (any), Sense Motive, and Use Magic Device at a cost of 1 skill point per rank. All these skills are considered class skills for dragons. (Each dragon has other class skills as well, as noted in the variety descriptions.)</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> All dragons have one feat, plus additional feats based on Hit Dice just like any other creature. Dragons favor Alertness, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Flyby Attack, Hover, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Snatch, Weapon Focus (claw or bite), Wingover, and any metamagic feat that is available and useful to sorcerers.</p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" style="font-weight: 700;">Dragon Age Categories</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Category</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Age (Years)</td></tr><tr><td>1 Wyrmling</td><td>0–5</td></tr><tr><td>2 Very young</td><td>6–15</td></tr><tr><td>3 Young</td><td>16–25</td></tr><tr><td>4 Juvenile</td><td>26–50</td></tr><tr><td>5 Young adult</td><td>51–100</td></tr><tr><td>6 Adult</td><td>101–200</td></tr><tr><td>7 Mature adult</td><td>201–400</td></tr><tr><td>8 Old</td><td>401–600</td></tr><tr><td>9 Very old</td><td>601–800</td></tr><tr><td>10 Ancient</td><td>801–1,000</td></tr><tr><td>11 Wyrm</td><td>1,001–1,200</td></tr><tr><td>12 Great wyrm</td><td>1,201 or more</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="table-container"><table style="min-width: 54.95em;" data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td colspan="8" style="font-weight: 700;">Dragon Space/Reach, Attacks, and Damage</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 6.225em; font-weight: 700;">Size</td><td style="min-width: 12.975em; font-weight: 700;">Space/Reach*</td><td style="min-width: 4.05em; font-weight: 700;">1 Bite</td><td style="min-width: 4.95em; font-weight: 700;">2 Claws</td><td style="min-width: 5.025em; font-weight: 700;">2 Wings</td><td style="min-width: 6.225em; font-weight: 700;">1 Tail Slap</td><td style="min-width: 4.725em; font-weight: 700;">1Crush</td><td style="min-width: 7.275em; font-weight: 700;">1 Tail Sweep</td></tr><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>2-1/2 ft./0 ft.

The size of its scales increases little as the dragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder. Its hide tends to hum and crackle faintly with built-up static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and sand. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed.</p><p>Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage.</p><p>Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems—especially sapphires.</p></section><section id="h4-11-combat"><h4>Combat</h4><p>Typically, blue dragons attack from above or burrow beneath the sands until opponents come within 100 feet. Older dragons use their special abilities, such as <i>hallucinatory terrain</i>, in concert with these tactics to mask the land and improve their chances to surprise the target. Blue dragons run from a fight only if they are severely damaged, since they view retreat as cowardly.</p><p><strong>Breath Weapon (Su):</strong> A blue dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of lightning.</p><p><strong><i>Create/Destroy Water</i> (Sp):</strong> A blue dragon of any age can use this ability three times per day. It works like the <i>create water</i> spell, except that the dragon can decide to destroy water instead of creating it, which automatically spoils unattended liquids containing water. Magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature’s possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon’s frightful presence) or be ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.</p><p><strong>Sound Imitation (Ex):</strong> A juvenile or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard, anytime it likes. Listeners must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon’s frightful presence) to detect the ruse.</p><p><strong>Other Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> 3/day—<i>ventriloquism</i> (adult or older); 1/day—<i>hallucinatory terrain</i> (old or older), <i>veil</i> (ancient or older), <i>mirage arcana</i> (great wyrm).</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Bluff, Hide, and Spellcraft are considered class skills for blue dragons.</p></section></section><section id="h2-12-green-dragon"><h2>GREEN DRAGON</h2><section id="h5-13-dragon-air"><h5>Dragon (Air)</h5><p><strong>Environment:</strong> Temperate forests</p><p><strong>Organization:</strong> Wyrmling, very young, young, juvenile, and young adult: solitary or clutch (2–5);

Toward the end of young age, the scales turn a deeper red, and the glossy texture is replaced by a smooth, dull finish. As the dragon grows older, the scales become large, thick, and as strong as metal. The neck frill and wings are an ash blue or purple-gray toward the edges, becoming darker with age. The pupils of a red dragon fade as it ages; the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.</p></section><section id="h4-17-combat"><h4>Combat</h4><p>Because red dragons are so confident, they seldom pause to appraise an adversary. On spotting a target, they make a snap decision whether to attack, using one of many strategies worked out ahead of time.

As the dragon gets older, the scales become more brassy until they reach a warm, burnished appearance. The grand head-plates of a brass dragon are smooth and metallic, and it sports bladed chin horns that grow sharper with age. Wings and frills are mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As the dragon grows older, its pupils fade until the eyes resemble molten metal orbs.</p></section><section id="h4-24-combat"><h4>Combat</h4><p>Brass dragons would rather talk than fight. If an intelligent creature tries to leave without engaging in conversation, the dragon might force compliance in a fit of pique, using <i>suggestion</i> or a dose of <i>sleep</i> gas. A creature put to sleep may wake to find itself pinned or buried to the neck in the sand until the dragon’s thirst for small talk is slaked. When faced with real danger, younger brass dragons fly out of sight, then hide by burrowing into the sand. Older dragons spurn this ploy but still prefer to have the advantage in combat.</p><p><strong>Breath Weapon (Su):</strong> A brass dragon has two types of breath weapon, a line of fire and a cone of <i>sleep</i>. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep, regardless of HD, for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.</p><p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> At will—<i>speak with animals;</i> 3/day—<i>endure elements</i> (juvenile or older; radius 10 ft. x dragon’s age category); 1/day—<i>suggestion</i> (adult or older), <i>control winds</i> (old or older), <i>control weather</i> (ancient or older).</p><p><strong><i>Summon Djinni</i> (Sp):</strong> This ability, usable by a great wyrm brass dragon, works like a <i>summon monster</i> spell, except that it summons one djinni. This ability is the equivalent of a 7th-level spell. </p><p>Skills: Bluff, Gather Information, and Survival are considered class skills for brass dragons.</p></section></section><section id="h2-25-bronze-dragon"><h2>BRONZE DRAGON</h2><section id="h5-26-dragon-water"><h5>Dragon (Water)</h5><p><strong>Environment:</strong> Temperate hills</p><p><strong>Organization:</strong> Wyrmling, very young, young, juvenile, and young adult: solitary or clutch (2–5);

As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color deepens slowly to a darker, rich bronze tone. Very old dragons develop a blue-black tint to the edges of their scales. Powerful swimmers, they have webbed feet and smooth, flat scales. The pupils of its eyes fade as a dragon ages, until in the oldest the eyes resemble glowing green orbs.</p></section><section id="h4-27-combat"><h4>Combat</h4><p>Bronze dragons dislike killing animals and would rather bribe them (perhaps with food) or force them away magically. They use <i>detect thoughts</i> to learn intelligent creatures’ intentions.</p><p>When attacking they blind their opponents with <i>fog cloud</i> and then charge or, if flying, snatch them up. Against seafaring opponents they conjure up a storm or use their tails to smash the vessels’ hulls. If a dragon is inclined to be lenient, ships might be merely becalmed, fogbound, or broken-masted.</p><p><strong>Breath Weapon (Su):</strong> Bronze dragons have two types of breath weapon, a line of lightning and a cone of <i>repulsion</i> gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon. This is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment effect.</p><p><strong>Water Breathing (Ex):</strong> A bronze dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.</p><p><strong>Alternate Form (Su):</strong> A young or older bronze dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day. This ability functions as a <i>polymorph</i> spell cast on itself at its caster level, except that the dragon does not regain hit points for changing form and can only assume the form of an animal or humanoid. The dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form.</p><p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> At will—<i>speak with animals;</i> 3/day—<i>create food and water</i> (adult or older), <i>fog cloud</i> (adult or older), <i>detect thoughts</i> (old or older), <i>control water</i> (ancient or older);

Gold dragons’ faces are bewhiskered and sagacious; as they age, their pupils fade until the eyes resemble pools of molten gold.</p></section><section id="h4-33-combat"><h4>Combat</h4><p>Gold dragons usually parley before fighting. When conversing with intelligent creatures, they use Intimidate and Sense Motive to gain the upper hand. In combat, they employ <i>bless</i> and their <i>luck bonus;</i> older dragons use their <i>luck bonus</i> at the start of each day. They make heavy use of spells in combat. Among their favorites are <i>cloudkill, delayed blast fireball, fire shield, globe of invulnerability, maze, sleep, slow,</i> and <i>stinking cloud.</i></p><p><strong>Breath Weapon (Su):</strong> A gold dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of fire and a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within a cone of weakening gas must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category of the dragon.</p><p><strong>Alternate Form (Su):</strong> A gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day. This ability functions as a <i>polymorph</i> spell cast on itself at its caster level, except that the dragon does not regain hit points for changing form and can only assume the form of an animal or humanoid. The dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form.</p><p><strong>Water Breathing (Ex):</strong> A gold dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged (the cone of fire becomes a cone of superheated steam underwater).</p><p><strong><i>Luck Bonus</i> (Sp):</strong> Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon’s hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature in a 10-foot radius per age category of the dragon receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws and similar rolls, as for a <i>stone of good luck</i>. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon but ends if the gem is destroyed. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.</p><p><strong><i>Detect Gems</i> (Sp):</strong> An old or older gold dragon can use this ability three times per day. This is a divination effect similar to a <i>detect magic</i> spell, except that it finds only gems. The dragon can scan a 60-degree arc each round: By concentrating for 1 round it knows if there are any gems within the arc; 2 rounds of concentration reveal the exact number of gems; and 3 rounds reveal their exact location, type, and value. This ability is the equivalent of a 2ndlevel spell.</p><p><strong>Other Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> 3/day—<i>bless</i> (juvenile or older); 1/day—<i>geas/quest</i> (old or older), <i>sunburst</i> (ancient or older), <i>foresight</i> (great wyrm).</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Disguise, Heal, and Swim are considered class skills for gold dragons.</p></section></section><section id="h2-34-silver-dragon"><h2>SILVER DRAGON</h2><section id="h5-35-dragon-cold"><h5>Dragon (Cold)</h5><p><strong>Environment:</strong> Temperate mountains</p><p><strong>Organization:</strong> Wyrmling, very young, young, juvenile, and young adult: solitary or clutch (2–5);

If necessary, they use <i>fog cloud</i> or <i>control weather</i> to blind or confuse opponents before attacking. When angry, they use <i>reverse gravity</i> to fling enemies helplessly into the air, where they can be snatched. Against flying opponents, a silver dragon hides in clouds (creating some with <i>control weather</i> on clear days), then jumps to the attack when it has the advantage.</p><p><strong>Breath Weapon (Su):</strong> A silver dragon has two types of breath weapon, a cone of cold and a cone of paralyzing gas. Creatures within a cone of paralyzing gas must succeed on a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.</p><p><strong>Alternate Form (Su):</strong> A silver dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action three times per day. This ability functions as a <i>polymorph</i> spell cast on itself at its caster level, except that the dragon does not regain hit points for changing form and can only assume the form of an anirmal or humanoid. The dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form.</p><p><strong>Cloudwalking (Su):</strong> A silver dragon can tread on clouds or fog as though on solid ground. The ability functions continuously but can be negated or resumed at will.</p><p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> 3/day—<i>fog cloud</i> (adult or older), <i>control winds</i> (old or older); 2/day—<i>feather fall</i> (juvenile or older); 1/day— <i>control weather</i> (ancient or older), <i>reverse gravity</i> (great wyrm).</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Bluff, Disguise, and Jump are considered class skills for silver dragons.</p></section></section></section><section id="h1-37-dragon-turtle"><h1>DRAGON TURTLE</h1><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td></td><td style="min-width: 21.4501em;">Huge Dragon (Aquatic)</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Hit Dice:</td><td>12d12+60 (138 hp)</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Initiative:</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Speed:</td><td>20 ft.

The skin can be very dark, but it is always some shade of tan or brown. Hair color can be black, gray, or brown. Dwarves average 4 feet tall and weigh as much as adult humans.</p><p>Dwarves speak Dwarven. Most who travel outside dwarven lands (as traders, mercenaries, or adventurers) know the Common tongue, while warriors in the dwarven cities usually learn Goblin to better interrogate and spy on those evil denizens of the deep caves.</p><p>Most dwarves encountered outside their home are warriors.</p><section id="h2-46-combat"><h2>COMBAT</h2><p>Dwarves are experts in combat, effectively using their environment and executing well-planned group attacks. They rarely use magic in fights, since they have few wizards or sorcerers (but dwarven clerics throw themselves into battle as heartily as their fellow warriors). If they have time to prepare, they may build deadfalls or other traps involving stone. In addition to the dwarven waraxe and thrown hammer, dwarves also use warhammers, picks, shortbows, heavy crossbows, and maces.</p><p><strong>Dwarf Traits (Ex):</strong> Dwarves possess the following racial traits.</p><p>— +2 Constitution, –2 Charisma.</p><p>—Medium size.</p><p>—A dwarf ’s base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.</p><p>—Darkvision out to to 60 feet.</p><p>—Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn’t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. Dwarves have a sixth sense about stonework, an innate ability that they get plenty of opportunity to practice and hone in their underground homes.</p><p>—Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.</p><p>—Stability: Dwarves are exceptionally stable on their feet. A dwarf has a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).</p><p>— +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison. *Not reflected in the saving throw numbers given here.</p><p>— +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects. *Not reflected in the saving throw numbers given here.</p><p>— +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs (including halforcs) and goblinoids (including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears).</p><p>— +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).</p><p>— +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items.</p><p>— +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.</p><p>—Automatic Languages: Common, Dwarven. Bonus Languages: Giant, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Terran, Undercommon.</p><p>—Favored Class: Fighter.</p><p>The dwarf warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.</p></section><section id="h2-47-subraces"><h2>SUBRACES</h2><p>The information above is for hill dwarves, the most common variety.</p><p>There are three other major dwarven subraces, which differ from hill dwarves as follows.</p><section id="h4-48-deep-dwarf"><h4>Deep Dwarf</h4><p>These dwarves live far underground and tend to be more standoffish with non-dwarves.</p><p>Deep dwarves are the same height as other dwarves, but leaner.
