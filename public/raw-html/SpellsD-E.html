A successful Will save negates the <i>suggestion</i> effect but not the contact itself. The <i>demand,</i> if received, is understood even if the subject’s Intelligence score is as low as 1.

Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p><p><em>Area Dispel:</em> When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.</p><p>For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level.

Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p><p><em>River, Lake, or Marsh:</em> Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures.

At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.</p><p><em>Pinned beneath Rubble:</em> Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned.

A sickened creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. A creature affected by this spell remains sickened for 10 minutes per caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i> spell, but a <i>remove curse</i> is effective.</p><p><em>Panicked:</em> The subject becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds. Even after the panic ends, the creature remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes panicked again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect.</p><p><em>Comatose:</em> The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a <i>sleep</i> effect, and thus elves are not immune to it.</p><p>The spell lasts for 1 round per three caster levels. You must spend a move action each round after the first to target a foe.</p></section></section></body></html>
