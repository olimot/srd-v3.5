Combat follows this sequence:</p><p>1. Each combatant starts out flat-footed. Once a combatant acts, he or she is no longer flat-footed.</p><p>2. Determine which characters are aware of their opponents at the start of the battle. If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise round happens before regular rounds of combat begin. The combatants who are aware of the opponents can act in the surprise round, so they roll for initiative. In initiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take one action (either a standard action or a move action) during the surprise round. Combatants who were unaware do not get to act in the surprise round. If no one or everyone starts the battle aware, there is no surprise round.</p><p>3. Combatants who have not yet rolled initiative do so. All combatants are now ready to begin their first regular round of combat.</p><p>4. Combatants act in initiative order (highest to lowest).</p><p>5. When everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the highest initiative acts again, and steps 4 and 5 repeat until combat ends.</p></section><section id="h1-2-combat-statistics"><h1>COMBAT STATISTICS</h1><p>This section summarizes the statistics that determine success in combat, and then details how to use</p><section id="h2-3-attack-roll"><h2>ATTACK ROLL</h2><p>An attack roll represents your attempt to strike your opponent on your turn in a round. When you make an attack roll, you roll a d20 and add your attack bonus. (Other modifiers may also apply to this roll.) If your result equals or beats the target’s Armor Class, you hit and deal damage.</p><p><strong>Automatic Misses and Hits:</strong> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on an attack roll is always a miss. A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a hit. A natural 20 is also a threat—a possible critical hit.</p></section><section id="h2-4-attack-bonus"><h2>ATTACK BONUS</h2><p>Your attack bonus with a melee weapon is:</p><p>Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + size modifier</p><p>With a ranged weapon, your attack bonus is:</p><p>Base attack bonus + Dexterity modifier + size modifier + range penalty</p><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Size Modifiers</caption><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Size</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Size Modifier</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Size</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Size Modifier</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>–8</td><td>Small</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>–4</td><td>Tiny</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>–2</td><td>Diminutive</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>–1</td><td>Fine</td><td>+8</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>+0</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h2-5-damage"><h2>DAMAGE</h2><p>When your attack succeeds, you deal damage. The type of weapon used determines the amount of damage you deal. Effects that modify weapon damage apply to unarmed strikes and the natural physical attack forms of creatures.</p><p>Damage reduces a target’s current hit points.</p><p><strong>Minimum Damage:</strong> If penalties reduce the damage result to less than 1, a hit still deals 1 point of damage.</p><p>Strength Bonus: When you hit with a melee or thrown weapon, including a sling, add your Strength modifier to the damage result. A Strength penalty, but not a bonus, applies on attacks made with a bow that is not a composite bow.</p><p><em>Off-Hand Weapon:</em> When you deal damage with a weapon in your off hand, you add only 1/2 your Strength bonus.</p><p><em>Wielding a Weapon Two-Handed:</em> When you deal damage with a weapon that you are wielding two-handed, you add 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus. However, you don’t get this higher Strength bonus when using a light weapon with two hands.</p><p><strong>Multiplying Damage:</strong> Sometimes you multiply damage by some factor, such as on a critical hit. Roll the damage (with all modifiers) multiple times and total the results. <i>Note:</i> When you multiply damage more than once, each multiplier works off the original, unmultiplied damage.</p><p><em>Exception:</em> Extra damage dice over and above a weapon’s normal damage are never multiplied.</p><p><strong>Ability Damage:</strong> Certain creatures and magical effects can cause temporary ability damage (a reduction to an ability score).</p></section><section id="h2-6-armor-class"><h2>ARMOR CLASS</h2><p>Your Armor Class (AC) represents how hard it is for opponents to land a solid, damaging blow on you. It’s the attack roll result that an opponent needs to achieve to hit you. Your AC is equal to the following: 10 + armor bonus + shield bonus + Dexterity modifier + size modifier</p><p>Note that armor limits your Dexterity bonus, so if you’re wearing armor, you might not be able to apply your whole Dexterity bonus to your AC.</p><p>Sometimes you can’t use your Dexterity bonus (if you have one). If you can’t react to a blow, you can’t use your Dexterity bonus to AC. (If you don’t have a Dexterity bonus, nothing happens.)</p><p>Other Modifiers: Many other factors modify your AC.</p><p><em>Enhancement Bonuses:</em> Enhancement effects make your armor better.</p><p><em>Deflection Bonus:</em> Magical deflection effects ward off attacks and improve your AC.</p><p><em>Natural Armor:</em> Natural armor improves your AC.</p><p><em>Dodge Bonuses:</em> Some other AC bonuses represent actively avoiding blows. These bonuses are called dodge bonuses. Any situation that denies you your Dexterity bonus also denies you dodge bonuses. (Wearing armor, however, does not limit these bonuses the way it limits a Dexterity bonus to AC.) Unlike most sorts of bonuses, dodge bonuses stack with each other.</p><p><strong>Touch Attacks:</strong> Some attacks disregard armor, including shields and natural armor. In these cases, the attacker makes a touch attack roll (either ranged or melee). When you are the target of a touch attack, your AC doesn’t include any armor bonus, shield bonus, or natural armor bonus. All other modifiers, such as your size modifier, Dexterity modifier, and deflection bonus (if any) apply normally.</p></section><section id="h2-7-hit-points"><h2>HIT POINTS</h2><p>When your hit point total reaches 0, you’re disabled. When it reaches –1, you’re dying. When it gets to –10, you’re dead.</p></section><section id="h2-8-speed"><h2>SPEED</h2><p>Your speed tells you how far you can move in a round and still do something, such as attack or cast a spell. Your speed depends mostly on your race and what armor you’re wearing.</p><p>Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have a speed of 20 feet (4 squares), or 15 feet (3 squares) when wearing medium or heavy armor (except for dwarves, who move 20 feet in any armor).</p><p>Humans, elves, half-elves, and half-orcs have a speed of 30 feet (6 squares), or 20 feet (4 squares) in medium or heavy armor.</p><p>If you use two move actions in a round (sometimes called a “double move” action), you can move up to double your speed. If you spend the entire round to run all out, you can move up to quadruple your speed (or triple if you are in heavy armor).</p></section><section id="h2-9-saving-throws"><h2>SAVING THROWS</h2><p>Generally, when you are subject to an unusual or magical attack, you get a saving throw to avoid or reduce the effect. Like an attack roll, a saving throw is a d20 roll plus a bonus based on your class, level, and an ability score. Your saving throw modifier is: Base save bonus + ability modifier </p><p><strong>Saving Throw Types:</strong> The three different kinds of saving throws are Fortitude, Reflex, and Will:</p><p><em>Fortitude:</em> These saves measure your ability to stand up to physical punishment or attacks against your vitality and health. Apply your Constitution modifier to your Fortitude saving throws. </p><p><em>Reflex:</em> These saves test your ability to dodge area attacks. Apply your Dexterity modifier to your Reflex saving throws. </p><p><em>Will:</em> These saves reflect your resistance to mental influence as well as many magical effects. Apply your Wisdom modifier to your Will saving throws.</p><p><strong>Saving Throw Difficulty Class:</strong> The DC for a save is determined by the attack itself.</p><p><strong>Automatic Failures and Successes:</strong> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always a failure (and may cause damage to exposed items; see Items Surviving after a Saving Throw). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.</p></section></section><section id="h1-10-initiative"><h1>INITIATIVE</h1><p><strong>Initiative Checks:</strong> At the start of a battle, each combatant makes an initiative check. An initiative check is a Dexterity check. Each character applies his or her Dexterity modifier to the roll. Characters act in order, counting down from highest result to lowest. In every round that follows, the characters act in the same order (unless a character takes an action that results in his or her initiative changing; see Special Initiative Actions).</p><p>If two or more combatants have the same initiative check result, the combatants who are tied act in order of total initiative modifier (highest first). If there is still a tie, the tied characters should roll again to determine which one of them goes before the other.</p><p><strong>Flat-Footed:</strong> At the start of a battle, before you have had a chance to act (specifically, before your first regular turn in the initiative order), you are flat-footed. You can’t use your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) while flat-footed. Barbarians and rogues have the uncanny dodge extraordinary ability, which allows them to avoid losing their Dexterity bonus to AC due to being flat-footed.</p><p>A flat-footed character can’t make attacks of opportunity.</p><p><strong>Inaction:</strong> Even if you can’t take actions, you retain your initiative score for the duration of the encounter.</p><section id="h2-11-surprise"><h2>SURPRISE</h2><p>When a combat starts, if you are not aware of your opponents and they are aware of you, you’re surprised.</p><section id="h4-12-determining-awareness"><h4>Determining Awareness</h4><p>Sometimes all the combatants on a side are aware of their opponents, sometimes none are, and sometimes only some of them are. Sometimes a few combatants on each side are aware and the other combatants on each side are unaware.</p><p>Determining awareness may call for Listen checks, Spot checks, or other checks.</p><p><strong>The Surprise Round:</strong> If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise round happens before regular rounds begin. Any combatants aware of the opponents can act in the surprise round, so they roll for initiative. In initiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take a standard action during the surprise round. You can also take free actions during the surprise round. If no one or everyone is surprised, no surprise round occurs.</p><p><strong>Unaware Combatants:</strong> Combatants who are unaware at the start of battle don’t get to act in the surprise round. Unaware combatants are flat-footed because they have not acted yet, so they lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p></section></section></section><section id="h1-13-attacks-of-opportunity"><h1>ATTACKS OF OPPORTUNITY</h1><p>Sometimes a combatant in a melee lets her guard down. In this case, combatants near her can take advantage of her lapse in defense to attack her for free. These free attacks are called attacks of opportunity.</p><p><strong>Threatened Squares:</strong> You threaten all squares into which you can make a melee attack, even when it is not your action. Generally, that means everything in all squares adjacent to your space (including diagonally). An enemy that takes certain actions while in a threatened square provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you’re unarmed, you don’t normally threaten any squares and thus can’t make attacks of opportunity.</p><p><em>Reach Weapons:</em> Most creatures of Medium or smaller size have a reach of only 5 feet. This means that they can make melee attacks only against creatures up to 5 feet (1 square) away. However, Small and Medium creatures wielding reach weapons threaten more squares than a typical creature. In addition, most creatures larger than Medium have a natural reach of 10 feet or more.</p><p><strong>Provoking an Attack of Opportunity:</strong> Two kinds of actions can provoke attacks of opportunity: moving out of a threatened square and performing an action within a threatened square.</p><p><em>Moving:</em> Moving out of a threatened square usually provokes an attack of opportunity from the threatening opponent. There are two common methods of avoiding such an attack—the 5-foot-step and the withdraw action (see below).</p><p><em>Performing a Distracting Act:</em> Some actions, when performed in a threatened square, provoke attacks of opportunity as you divert your attention from the battle. Table: Actions in Combat notes many of the actions that provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>Remember that even actions that normally provoke attacks of opportunity may have exceptions to this rule.</p><p><strong>Making an Attack of Opportunity:</strong> An attack of opportunity is a single melee attack, and you can only make one per round. You don’t have to make an attack of opportunity if you don’t want to.</p><p>An experienced character gets additional regular melee attacks (by using the full attack action), but at a lower attack bonus. You make your attack of opportunity, however, at your normal attack bonus—even if you’ve already attacked in the round.</p><p>An attack of opportunity “interrupts” the normal flow of actions in the round. If an attack of opportunity is provoked, immediately resolve the attack of opportunity, then continue with the next character’s turn (or complete the current turn, if the attack of opportunity was provoked in the midst of a character’s turn).</p><p><em>Combat Reflexes and Additional Attacks of Opportunity:</em> If you have the Combat Reflexes feat you can add your Dexterity modifier to the number of attacks of opportunity you can make in a round. This feat does not let you make more than one attack for a given opportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two attacks of opportunity from you, you could make two separate attacks of opportunity (since each one represents a different opportunity). Moving out of more than one square threatened by the same opponent in the same round doesn’t count as more than one opportunity for that opponent. All these attacks are at your full normal attack bonus.</p></section><section id="h1-14-actions-in-combat"><h1>ACTIONS IN COMBAT</h1><section id="h2-15-the-combat-round"><h2>THE COMBAT ROUND</h2><p>Each round represents 6 seconds in the game world. A round presents an opportunity for each character involved in a combat situation to take an action. </p><p>Each round’s activity begins with the character with the highest initiative result and then proceeds, in order, from there. Each round of a combat uses the same initiative order. When a character’s turn comes up in the initiative sequence, that character performs his entire round’s worth of actions. (For exceptions, see Attacks of Opportunity and Special Initiative Actions.)</p><p>For almost all purposes, there is no relevance to the end of a round or the beginning of a round. A round can be a segment of game time starting with the first character to act and ending with the last, but it usually means a span of time from one round to the same initiative count in the next round. Effects that last a certain number of rounds end just before the same initiative count that they began on.</p></section><section id="h2-16-action-types"><h2>ACTION TYPES</h2><p>An action’s type essentially tells you how long the action takes to perform (within the framework of the 6-second combat round) and how movement is treated. There are four types of actions: standard actions, move actions, full-round actions, and free actions.</p><p>In a normal round, you can perform a standard action and a move action, or you can perform a full-round action. You can also perform one or more free actions. You can always take a move action in place of a standard action.</p><p>In some situations (such as in a surprise round), you may be limited to taking only a single move action or standard action.</p><p><strong>Standard Action:</strong> A standard action allows you to do something, most commonly make an attack or cast a spell. See Table: Actions in Combat for other standard actions.</p><p><strong>Move Action:</strong> A move action allows you to move your speed or perform an action that takes a similar amount of time. See Table: Actions in Combat.</p><p>You can take a move action in place of a standard action. If you move no actual distance in a round (commonly because you have swapped your move for one or more equivalent actions), you can take one 5-foot step either before, during, or after the action.</p><p><strong>Full-Round Action:</strong> A full-round action consumes all your effort during a round. The only movement you can take during a full-round action is a 5-foot step before, during, or after the action. You can also perform free actions (see below).</p><p>Some full-round actions do not allow you to take a 5-foot step.</p><p>Some full-round actions can be taken as standard actions, but only in situations when you are limited to performing only a standard action during your round. The descriptions of specific actions, below, detail which actions allow this option.</p><p><strong>Free Action:</strong> Free actions consume a very small amount of time and effort. You can perform one or more free actions while taking another action normally. However, there are reasonable limits on what you can really do for free.</p><p><strong>Not an Action:</strong> Some activities are so minor that they are not even considered free actions. They literally don’t take any time at all to do and are considered an inherent part of doing something else.</p><p><strong>Restricted Activity:</strong> In some situations, you may be unable to take a full round’s worth of actions. In such cases, you are restricted to taking only a single standard action or a single move action (plus free actions as normal). You can’t take a full-round action (though you can start or complete a full-round action by using a standard action; see below).</p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td style="min-width: 20.5501em; font-weight: 700;">Table: Actions in Combat</td><td style="min-width: 10.65em;"></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Standard Action</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Attack of Opportunity<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Attack (melee)</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Attack (ranged)</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Attack (unarmed)</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Activate a magic item other than a potion or oil</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Aid another</td><td>Maybe<sup style="font-weight: 700;">2</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Bull rush</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Cast a spell (1 standard action casting time)</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Concentrate to maintain an active spell</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Dismiss a spell</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Draw a hidden weapon (see Sleight of Hand skill)</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Drink a potion or apply an oil</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Escape a grapple</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Feint</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Light a torch with a tindertwig</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Lower spell resistance</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Make a dying friend stable (see Heal skill)</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Overrun</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Read a scroll</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Ready (triggers a standard action)</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Sunder a weapon (attack)</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Sunder an object (attack)</td><td>Maybe<sup style="font-weight: 700;">3</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Total defense</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Turn or rebuke undead</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Use extraordinary ability</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Use skill that takes 1 action</td><td>Usually</td></tr><tr><td>Use spell-like ability</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Use supernatural ability</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Move Action</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Attack of Opportunity<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Move</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Control a frightened mount</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Direct or redirect an active spell</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Draw a weapon4</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Load a hand crossbow or light crossbow</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Open or close a door</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Mount a horse or dismount</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Move a heavy object</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Pick up an item</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Sheathe a weapon</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Stand up from prone</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Ready or loose a shield<sup style="font-weight: 700;">4</sup></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Retrieve a stored item</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Full-Round Action</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Attack of Opportunity<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Full attack</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Charge5</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Deliver coup de grace</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Escape from a net</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Extinguish flames</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Light a torch</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Load a heavy or repeating crossbow</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Lock or unlock weapon in locked gauntlet</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Prepare to throw splash weapon</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Run</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Use skill that takes 1 round</td><td>Usually</td></tr><tr><td>Use touch spell on up to six friends</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Withdraw<sup style="font-weight: 700;">5</sup></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Free Action</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Attack of Opportunity<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Cast a quickened spell</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Cease concentration on a spell</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Drop an item</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Drop to the floor</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Prepare spell components to cast a spell<sup style="font-weight: 700;">6</sup></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Speak</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">No Action</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Attack of Opportunity<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Delay</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>5-foot step</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Action Type Varies</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Disarm<sup style="font-weight: 700;">7</sup></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Grapple<sup style="font-weight: 700;">7</sup></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Trip an opponent<sup style="font-weight: 700;">7</sup></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Use feat<sup style="font-weight: 700;">8</sup></td><td>Varies</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">1 Regardless of the action, if you move out of a threatened square, you usually provoke an attack of opportunity.

(Opponents within 5 feet are considered adjacent to you.) Some melee weapons have reach, as indicated in their descriptions. With a typical reach weapon, you can strike opponents 10 feet away, but you can’t strike adjacent foes (those within 5 feet).</p><p><strong>Unarmed Attacks:</strong> Striking for damage with punches, kicks, and head butts is much like attacking with a melee weapon, except for the following:</p><p><em>Attacks of Opportunity:</em> Attacking unarmed provokes an attack of opportunity from the character you attack, provided she is armed. The attack of opportunity comes before your attack. An unarmed attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity from other foes nor does it provoke an attack of opportunity from an unarmed foe.</p><p>An unarmed character can’t take attacks of opportunity (but see “Armed” Unarmed Attacks, below).</p><p><em>“Armed” Unarmed Attacks:</em> Sometimes a character’s or creature’s unarmed attack counts as an armed attack. A monk, a character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, a spellcaster delivering a touch attack spell, and a creature with natural physical weapons all count as being armed.</p><p>Note that being armed counts for both offense and defense (the character can make attacks of opportunity)</p><p><em>Unarmed Strike Damage:</em> An unarmed strike from a Medium character deals 1d3 points of damage (plus your Strength modifier, as normal). A Small character’s unarmed strike deals 1d2 points of damage, while a Large character’s unarmed strike deals 1d4 points of damage. All damage from unarmed strikes is nonlethal damage. Unarmed strikes count as light weapons (for purposes of two-weapon attack penalties and so on).</p><p><em>Dealing Lethal Damage:</em> You can specify that your unarmed strike will deal lethal damage before you make your attack roll, but you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll. If you have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, you can deal lethal damage with an unarmed strike without taking a penalty on the attack roll.</p><p><strong>Ranged Attacks:</strong> With a ranged weapon, you can shoot or throw at any target that is within the weapon’s maximum range and in line of sight. The maximum range for a thrown weapon is five range increments. For projectile weapons, it is ten range increments. Some ranged weapons have shorter maximum ranges, as specified in their descriptions.</p><p><strong>Attack Rolls:</strong> An attack roll represents your attempts to strike your opponent. </p><p>Your attack roll is 1d20 + your attack bonus with the weapon you’re using. If the result is at least as high as the target’s AC, you hit and deal damage.</p><p><strong>Automatic Misses and Hits:</strong> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on the attack roll is always a miss. A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a hit. A natural 20 is also a threat—a possible critical hit.</p><p><strong>Damage Rolls:</strong> If the attack roll result equals or exceeds the target’s AC, the attack hits and you deal damage. Roll the appropriate damage for your weapon. Damage is deducted from the target’s current hit points.</p><p><strong>Multiple Attacks:</strong> A character who can make more than one attack per round must use the full attack action (see Full-Round Actions, below) in order to get more than one attack.</p><p><strong>Shooting or Throwing into a Melee:</strong> If you shoot or throw a ranged weapon at a target engaged in melee with a friendly character, you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll. Two characters are engaged in melee if they are enemies of each other and either threatens the other. (An unconscious or otherwise immobilized character is not considered engaged unless he is actually being attacked.)</p><p>If your target (or the part of your target you’re aiming at, if it’s a big target) is at least 10 feet away from the nearest friendly character, you can avoid the –4 penalty, even if the creature you’re aiming at is engaged in melee with a friendly character.</p><p><em>Precise Shot:</em> If you have the Precise Shot feat you don’t take this penalty.</p><p><strong>Fighting Defensively as a Standard Action:</strong> You can choose to fight defensively when attacking. If you do so, you take a –4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC for the same round.</p><p><strong>Critical Hits:</strong> When you make an attack roll and get a natural 20 (the d20 shows 20), you hit regardless of your target’s Armor Class, and you have scored a threat. The hit might be a critical hit (or “crit”). To find out if it’s a critical hit, you immediately make a critical roll—another attack roll with all the same modifiers as the attack roll you just made. If the critical roll also results in a hit against the target’s AC, your original hit is a critical hit. (The critical roll just needs to hit to give you a crit. It doesn’t need to come up 20 again.) If the critical roll is a miss, then your hit is just a regular hit.</p><p>A critical hit means that you roll your damage more than once, with all your usual bonuses, and add the rolls together. Unless otherwise specified, the threat range for a critical hit on an attack roll is 20, and the multiplier is x2.</p><p><i>Exception</i>:Extra damage over and above a weapon’s normal damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.</p><p><i>Increased Threat Range</i>:Sometimes your threat range is greater than 20. That is, you can score a threat on a lower number. In such cases, a roll of lower than 20 is not an automatic hit. Any attack roll that doesn’t result in a hit is not a threat.</p><p><i>Increased Critical Multiplier</i>:Some weapons deal better than double damage on a critical hit.</p><p><em>Spells and Critical Hits:</em> A spell that requires an attack rollcan score a critical hit. A spell attack that requires no attack rollcannot score a critical hit.</p></section><section id="h4-19-cast-a-spell"><h4>Cast a Spell</h4><p>Most spells require 1 standard action to cast. You can cast such a spell either before or after you take a move action. </p><p><em>Note:</em> You retain your Dexterity bonus to AC while casting.</p><p><strong>Spell Components:</strong> To cast a spell with a verbal (V) component, your character must speak in a firm voice. If you’re gagged or in the area of a <i>silence</i> spell, you can’t cast such a spell. A spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance to spoil any spell he tries to cast if that spell has a verbal component.</p><p>To cast a spell with a somatic (S) component, you must gesture freely with at least one hand. You can’t cast a spell of this type while bound, grappling, or with both your hands full or occupied.</p><p>To cast a spell with a material (M), focus (F), or divine focus (DF) component, you have to have the proper materials, as described by the spell. Unless these materials are elaboratepreparing these materials is a free action. For material components and focuses whose costs are not listed, you can assume that you have them if you have your spell component pouch.</p><p>Some spells have an experience point (XP) component and entail an experience point cost to you. No spell can restore the lost XP. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a level, so you cannot cast the spell unless you have enough XP to spare. However, you may, on gaining enough XP to achieve a new level, immediately spend the XP on casting the spell rather than keeping it to advance a level. The XP are expended when you cast the spell, whether or not the casting succeeds.</p><p><strong>Concentration:</strong> You must concentrate to cast a spell. If you can’t concentrate you can’t cast a spell. If you start casting a spell but something interferes with your concentration you must make a Concentration check or lose the spell. The check’s DC depends on what is threatening your concentration (see the Concentration skill). If you fail, the spell fizzles with no effect. If you prepare spells, it is lost from preparation. If you cast at will, it counts against your daily limit of spells even though you did not cast it successfully.</p><p><strong>Concentrating to Maintain a Spell:</strong> Some spells require continued concentration to keep them going. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action that doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. Anything that could break your concentration when casting a spell can keep you from concentrating to maintain a spell. If your concentration breaks, the spell ends.</p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Most spells have a casting time of 1 standard action. A spell cast in this manner immediately takes effect.</p><p><strong>Attacks of Opportunity:</strong> Generally, if you cast a spell, you provoke attacks of opportunity from threatening enemies. If you take damage from an attack of opportunity, you must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + points of damage taken + spell level) or lose the spell. Spells that require only a free action to cast don’t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p><strong>Casting on the Defensive:</strong> Casting a spell while on the defensive does not provoke an attack of opportunity. It does, however, require a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to pull off. Failure means that you lose the spell.</p><p><strong>Touch Spells in Combat:</strong> Many spells have a range of touch. To use these spells, you cast the spell and then touch the subject, either in the same round or any time later. In the same round that you cast the spell, you may also touch (or attempt to touch) the target. You may take your move before casting the spell, after touching the target, or between casting the spell and touching the target. You can automatically touch one friend or use the spell on yourself, but to touch an opponent, you must succeed on an attack roll.</p><p><em>Touch Attacks:</em> Touching an opponent with a touch spell is considered to be an armed attack and therefore does not provoke attacks of opportunity. However, the act of casting a spell does provoke an attack of opportunity. Touch attacks come in two types: melee touch attacks and ranged touch attacks. You can score critical hits with either type of attack. Your opponent’s AC against a touch attack does not include any armor bonus, shield bonus, or natural armor bonus. His size modifier, Dexterity modifier, and deflection bonus (if any) all apply normally.</p><p><em>Holding the Charge:</em> If you don’t discharge the spell in the round when you cast the spell, you can hold the discharge of the spell (hold the charge) indefinitely. You can continue to make touch attacks round after round. You can touch one friend as a standard action or up to six friends as a full-round action. If you touch anything or anyone while holding a charge, even unintentionally, the spell discharges. If you cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates. Alternatively, you may make a normal unarmed attack (or an attack with a natural weapon) while holding a charge. In this case, you aren’t considered armed and you provoke attacks of opportunity as normal for the attack. (If your unarmed attack or natural weapon attack doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, neither does this attack.) If the attack hits, you deal normal damage for your unarmed attack or natural weapon and the spell discharges. If the attack misses, you are still holding the charge.</p><p><strong>Dismiss a Spell:</strong> Dismissing an active spell is a standard action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p></section><section id="h4-20-activate-magic-item"><h4>Activate Magic Item</h4><p>Many magic items don’t need to be activated. However, certain magic items need to be activated, especially potions, scrolls, wands, rods, and staffs. Activating a magic item is a standard action (unless the item description indicates otherwise).</p><p><strong>Spell Completion Items:</strong> Activating a spell completion item is the equivalent of casting a spell. It requires concentration and provokes attacks of opportunity. You lose the spell if your concentration is broken, and you can attempt to activate the item while on the defensive, as with casting a spell.</p><p><strong>Spell Trigger, Command Word, or Use-Activated Items:</strong> Activating any of these kinds of items does not require concentration and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p></section><section id="h4-21-use-special-ability"><h4>Use Special Ability</h4><p>Using a special ability is usually a standard action, but whether it is a standard action, a full-round action, or not an action at all is defined by the ability.</p><p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> Using a spell-like ability works like casting a spell in that it requires concentration and provokes attacks of opportunity. Spell-like abilities can be disrupted. If your concentration is broken, the attempt to use the ability fails, but the attempt counts as if you had used the ability. The casting time of a spell-like ability is 1 standard action, unless the ability description notes otherwise.</p><p><em>Using a Spell-Like Ability on the Defensive:</em> You may attempt to use a spell-like ability on the defensive, just as with casting a spell. If the Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) fails, you can’t use the ability, but the attempt counts as if you had used the ability.</p><p><strong>Supernatural Abilities:</strong> Using a supernatural ability is usually a standard action (unless defined otherwise by the ability’s description). Its use cannot be disrupted, does not require concentration, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p><strong>Extraordinary Abilities:</strong> Using an extraordinary ability is usually not an action because most extraordinary abilities automatically happen in a reactive fashion. Those extraordinary abilities that are actions are usually standard actions that cannot be disrupted, do not require concentration, and do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p></section><section id="h4-22-total-defense"><h4>Total Defense</h4><p>You can defend yourself as a standard action.

Thus, it can’t be coupled with a standard or a move action, though if it does not involve moving any distance, you can take a 5-foot step.</p><section id="h4-33-full-attack"><h4>Full Attack</h4><p>If you get more than one attack per round because your base attack bonus is high enough, because you fight with two weapons or a double weapon or for some special reason you must use a full-round action to get your additional attacks. You do not need to specify the targets of your attacks ahead of time. You can see how the earlier attacks turn out before assigning the later ones.</p><p>The only movement you can take during a full attack is a 5-foot step. You may take the step before, after, or between your attacks.</p><p>If you get multiple attacks because your base attack bonus is high enough, you must make the attacks in order from highest bonus to lowest. If you are using two weapons, you can strike with either weapon first. If you are using a double weapon, you can strike with either part of the weapon first.</p><p><strong>Deciding between an Attack or a Full Attack:</strong> After your first attack, you can decide to take a move action instead of making your remaining attacks, depending on how the first attack turns out. If you’ve already taken a 5-foot step, you can’t use your move action to move any distance, but you could still use a different kind of move action.</p><p><strong>Fighting Defensively as a Full-Round Action:</strong> You can choose to fight defensively when taking a full attack action. If you do so, you take a –4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC for the same round.</p><p><strong>Cleave:</strong> The extra attack granted by the Cleave feat or Great Cleave feat can be taken whenever they apply.

These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the spell automatically fails.</p><p>When you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must continue the invocations, gestures, and concentration from one round to just before your turn in the next round (at least).

While casting a spell, you don’t threaten any squares around you.</p><p>This action is otherwise identical to the cast a spell action described under Standard Actions.</p><p><strong>Casting a Metamagic Spell:</strong> Sorcerers and bards must take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than a regular spell. If a spell’s normal casting time is 1 standard action, casting a metamagic version of the spell is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. Note that this isn’t the same as a spell with a 1-round casting time—the spell takes effect in the same round that you begin casting, and you aren’t required to continue the invocations, gestures, and concentration until your next turn. For spells with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the metamagic spell.</p><p>Clerics must take more time to spontaneously cast a metamagic version of a <i>cure</i> or <i>inflict</i> spell.Spontaneously casting a metamagic version of a spell with a casting time of 1 standard action is a full-round action, and spells with longer casting times take an extra full-round action to cast.</p></section><section id="h4-35-use-special-ability"><h4>Use Special Ability</h4><p>Using a special ability is usually a standard action, but some may be full-round actions, as defined by the ability.</p></section><section id="h4-36-withdraw"><h4>Withdraw</h4><p>Withdrawing from melee combat is a full-round action. When you withdraw, you can move up to double your speed. The square you start out in is not considered threatened by any opponent you can see, and therefore visible enemies do not get attacks of opportunity against you when you move from that square.
