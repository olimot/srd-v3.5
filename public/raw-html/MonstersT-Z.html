Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 36 Will save or become shaken, remaining in that condition as long as they remain with 60 feet of the tarrasque. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><strong>Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, the tarrasque must hit a Huge or smaller opponent with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the foe the following round.</p><p><strong>Rush (Ex):</strong> Once per minute, the normally slow-moving tarrasque can move at a speed of 150 feet. </p><p><strong>Swallow Whole (Ex):</strong> The tarrasque can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+8 points of crushing damage plus 2d8+6 points of acid damage per round from the tarrasque’s digestive juices. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by dealing 50 points of damage to the tarrasque’s digestive tract (AC 25). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. The tarrasque’s gullet can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, or 512 Tiny or smaller creatures. </p><p><strong>Carapace (Ex):</strong> The tarrasque’s armorlike carapace is exceptionally tough and highly reflective, deflecting all rays, lines, cones, and even <i>magic missile</i>spells. There is a 30% chance of reflecting any such effect back at the caster; otherwise, it is merely negated. Check for reflection before rolling to overcome the creature’s spell resistance.</p><p><strong>Regeneration (Ex):</strong> No form of attack deals lethal damage to the tarrasque. The tarrasque regenerates even if it fails a saving throw against a <i>disintegrate</i> spell or a death effect. If the tarrasque fails its save against a spell or effect that would kill it instantly (such as those mentioned above), the spell or effect instead deals nonlethal damage equal to the creature’s full normal hit points +10 (or 868 hp). The tarrasque is immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding wounds, such as mummy rot, a sword with the wounding special ability, or a clay golem’s cursed wound ability.</p><p>The tarrasque can be slain only by raising its nonlethal damage total to its full normal hit points +10 (or 868 hit points) and using a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell to keep it dead.</p><p>If the tarrasque loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes (the detached piece dies and decays normally). The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> The tarrasque has a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p></section></section><section id="h1-3-tendriculos"><h1>TENDRICULOS</h1><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Huge Plant</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>9d8+54 (94 hp)</td></tr><tr><th>Initiative:</th><td>–1</td></tr><tr><th>Speed:</th><td>20 ft.

It attempts to swallow as much flesh as it can, as quickly as it can.</p><p><strong>Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a tendriculos must hit a creature at least one size smaller than itself with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the opponent in the following round. A tendriculos can also use its improved grab ability on a tendril attack. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold, picks up the opponent, and transfers it to the mouth as a free action, automatically dealing bite damage.</p><p><strong>Swallow Whole/Paralysis (Ex):</strong> A tendriculos can try to swallow a grabbed opponent by making a successful grapple check. Once inside the plant’s mass, the opponent must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds by the tendriculos’s digestive juices, taking 2d6 points of acid damage per round. A new save is required each round inside the plant. The save DC is Constitution-based. A swallowed creature that avoids paralysis can climb out of the mass with a successful grapple check. This returns it to the plant’s maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. A swallowed creature can also cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the tendriculos’s interior (AC 14). Once the creature exits, the plant’s regenerative capacity closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Huge tendriculos’s interior can hold 2 Large, 8 Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or smaller opponents. </p><p><strong>Regeneration (Ex):</strong> Bludgeoning weapons and acid deal normal damage to a tendriculos. A tendriculos that loses part of its body mass can regrow it in 1d6 minutes. Holding the severed portion against the mass enables it to reattach instantly. </p></section></section><section id="h1-5-thoqqua"><h1>THOQQUA</h1><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td></td><td style="min-width: 22.5751em;">Medium Elemental (Earth, Extraplanar, Fire)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>3d8+3 (16 hp)</td></tr><tr><th>Initiative:</th><td>+1</td></tr><tr><th>Speed:</th><td>30 ft.

Saves have a DC of 10 + 1/2 vampire’s HD + vampire’s Cha modifier unless noted otherwise.</p><p><strong><i>Blood Drain (Ex):</i></strong>A vampire can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained. On each such successful attack, the vampire gains 5 temporary hit points.</p><p><strong><i>Children of the Night (Su):</i></strong>Vampires command the lesser creatures of the world and once per day can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack of 3d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.</p><p><strong><i>Dominate (Su):</i></strong>A vampire can crush an opponent’s will just by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except that the vampire must use a standard action, and those merely looking at it are not affected. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampire’s influence as though by a <i>dominate person</i> spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet.</p><p><strong><i>Create Spawn (Su):</i></strong>A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by a vampire’s energy drain rises as a vampire spawn (see the Vampire Spawn entry) 1d4 days after burial. </p><p>If the vampire instead drains the victim’s Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or less HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn is under the command of the vampire that created it and remains enslaved until its master’s destruction. At any given time a vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit are created as free-willed vampires or vampire spawn. A vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of lesser vampires in this fashion. A vampire may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.</p><p><strong><i>Energy Drain (Su):</i></strong>Living creatures hit by a vampire’s slam attack (or any other natural weapon the vampire might possess) gain two negative levels. For each negative level bestowed, the vampire gains 5 temporary hit points. A vampire can use its energy drain ability once per round.</p><p><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A vampire retains all the special qualities of the base creature and gains those described below.</p><p><em>Alternate Form (Su):</em> A vampire can assume the shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. This ability is similar to a <i>polymorph</i> spell cast by a 12th-level character, except that the vampire does not regain hit points for changing form and must choose from among the forms mentioned here. While in its alternate form, the vampire loses its natural slam attack and dominate ability, but it gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of its new form. It can remain in that form until it assumes another or until the next sunrise. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might allow other forms.)</p><p><em>Damage Reduction (Su):</em> A vampire has damage reduction 10/silver and magic. A vampire’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p><em>Fast Healing (Ex):</em> A vampire heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Any additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in its coffin, a vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.</p><p><em>Gaseous Form (Su):</em> As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.</p><p><em>Resistances (Ex):</em> A vampire has resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10.</p><p><em>Spider Climb (Ex):</em> A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though with a <i>spider climb</i> spell.</p><p><em>Turn Resistance (Ex):</em> A vampire has +4 turn resistance. </p><p><strong>Abilities:</strong> Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4.

Otherwise same as the base creature.</p><p><strong>Feats:</strong> Vampires gain Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Improved Initiative, and Lightning Reflexes, assuming the base creature meets the prerequisites and doesn’t already have these feats.</p><p><strong>Environment:</strong> Any, usually same as base creature.</p><p><strong>Organization:</strong> Solitary, pair, gang (3–5), or troupe (1–2 plus 2–5 vampire spawn)</p><p><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Same as the base creature +2.</p><p><strong>Treasure:</strong> Double standard.</p><p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Always evil (any).</p><p><strong>Advancement:</strong> By character class.</p><p><strong>Level Adjustment:</strong> Same as the base creature +8.</p><section id="h4-31-vampire-weaknesses"><h4>Vampire Weaknesses</h4><p>For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Repelling a Vampire:</strong> Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These things don’t harm the vampire—they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature holding the item for the rest of the encounter. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action.</p><p>Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they can be carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard a ship.</p><p>They are utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. They may freely enter public places, since these are by definition open to all. </p><p><strong>Slaying a Vampire:</strong> Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it (see the note on fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can take only a single move action or attack action and is destroyed utterly in the next round if it cannot escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water robs it of one-third of its hit points each round until it is destroyed at the end of the third round of immersion. Driving a wooden stake through a vampire’s heart instantly slays the monster. However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the body is destroyed. A popular tactic is to cut off the creature’s head and fill its mouth with holy wafers (or their equivalent).</p></section><section id="h4-32-vampire-characters"><h4>Vampire Characters</h4><p>Vampires are always evil, which causes characters of certain classes to lose some class abilities. In addition, certain classes take additional penalties.</p><p><strong>Clerics:</strong> Vampire clerics lose their ability to turn undead but gain the ability to rebuke undead. This ability does not affect the vampire’s controller or any other vampires that a master controls. A vampire cleric has access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Destruction, Evil, or Trickery.</p><p><strong>Sorcerers and Wizards:</strong> Vampire sorcerers and wizards retain their class abilities, but if a character has a familiar other than a rat or bat, the link between them is broken, and the familiar shuns its former companion. The character can summon another familiar, but it must be a rat or bat.</p></section></section></section><section id="h1-33-vampire-spawn"><h1>VAMPIRE SPAWN</h1><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td></td><td style="min-width: 22.5751em;">Medium Undead</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>4d12+3 (29 hp)</td></tr><tr><th>Initiative:</th><td>+6</td></tr><tr><th>Speed:</th><td>30 ft.

They also use their gaseous form and flight abilities to strike where opponents are most vulnerable.</p><p><strong>Blood Drain (Ex):</strong> A vampire spawn can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round. On each such successful drain attack, the vampire spawn gains 5 temporary hit pints.</p><p><strong>Domination (Su):</strong> A vampire spawn can crush an opponent’s will just by looking onto his or her eyes.

The ability has a range of 30 feet. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p><strong>Energy Drain (Su):</strong> Living creatures hit by a vampire spawn’s slam attack gain one negative level.

For each such negative level bestowed, the vampire spawn gains 5 temporary hit points.</p><p><strong>Fast Healing (Ex):</strong> A vampire spawn heals 2 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Once at rest in its coffin, it is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 2 hit points per round.</p><p><strong>Gaseous Form (Su):</strong> As a standard action, a vampire spawn can assume <i>gaseous form</i> at will as the spell (caster level 6th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.</p><p><strong>Spider Climb (Ex):</strong> A vampire spawn can climb sheer surfaces as though with a <i>spider climb</i> spell.</p><p><strong>Skills:</strong> Vampire spawn have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks.</p></section><section id="h2-35-vampire-spawn-weaknesses"><h2>VAMPIRE SPAWN WEAKNESSES</h2><p>Vampire spawn are vulnerable to all attacks and effects that repel or slay vampires.

Xills speak Infernal.</p><section id="h2-53-combat"><h2>COMBAT</h2><p>Xills are dangerous opponents, attacking with all four limbs. More civilized ones use weapons, usually fighting with two at a time so as to leave two claws free for grab attacks. Xills typically lie in wait on the Ethereal Plane for suitable prey to happen by, then ambush it using their planewalk ability. They make full use of their Tumble skill in combat: Usually, one or two distract physically powerful enemies by attacking, then assuming a defensive stance while their fellows maneuver to advantage. </p><p><strong>Implant (Ex):</strong> As a standard action, a xill can lay eggs inside a paralyzed creature. The young emerge about 90 days later, literally devouring the host from inside. A <i>remove disease</i> spell rids a victim of the egg, as does a DC 25 Heal check. If the check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient.</p><p><strong>Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a xill must hit with one or more claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. It receives a +2 bonus on the grapple check for each claw that hits. If it wins the grapple check and maintains the hold in the next round, it automatically bites the foe at that time. The bite deals no damage but injects a paralyzing venom.</p><p><strong>Paralysis (Ex):</strong> Those bitten by a xill must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p><strong>Planewalk (Su):</strong> These planar travelers like to slip between the folds of space to attack enemies as though from thin air. They can cross from the Ethereal Plane with a move action but take 2 rounds to cross back, during which time they are immobile. As a xill fades away, it becomes harder to hit: Opponents have a 20% miss chance in</p><p>the first round and a 50% miss chance in the second. A xill can planewalk with a willing or helpless creature.</p></section></section><section id="h1-54-xorn"><h1>XORN</h1><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td></td><th style="min-width: 14.7em;">Minor Xorn</th><th style="min-width: 14.7em;">Average Xorn</th><th style="min-width: 14.7em;">Elder Xorn</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Small Outsider (Extraplanar, Earth)</td><td>Medium Outsider (Extraplanar, Earth)</td><td>Large Outsider (Extraplanar, Earth)</td></tr><tr><th>Hit Dice:</th><td>3d8+9 (22 hp)</td><td>7d8+17 (48 hp)</td><td>15d8+63 (130 hp)</td></tr><tr><th>Initiative:</th><td>+0</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><th>Speed:</th><td>20 ft.
