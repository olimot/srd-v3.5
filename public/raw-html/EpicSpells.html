Despite their power, epic spells still follow the basic rules for casting spells, except as specifically noted otherwise. Epic casters can manipulate the seeds of true magic, but knowing the seeds and how to manipulate them does not instantly grant ultimate power. Each epic spell must be laboriously developed before it can be used. </p></section><section id="h2-2-acquiring-epic-spells"><h2>ACQUIRING EPIC SPELLS </h2><p>A character with the Epic Spellcasting feat may start acquiring epic spells immediately. Using epic spells is a two-step procedure: development and spellcasting. </p></section><section id="h2-3-epic-spell-development"><h2>EPIC SPELL DEVELOPMENT </h2><p>Before it can be cast, an epic spell must be developed. The process of development can be a time-consuming and expensive process. It is during development that a caster determines whether a given epic spell lies within his or her abilities or beyond them. The basis of that determination lies in an epic spell’s Spellcraft DC. </p><p>The easiest way to develop an epic spell is to use one already given. The description of each of these unique spells gives the amount of gold, time, and experience points required to develop the spell. If a character pays a spell’s development cost, he or she develops (and thus knows) that spell. </p><p>For information on developing an epic spell completely from scratch, see Developing Unique Epic Spells, below. </p></section><section id="h2-4-epic-spellcasting"><h2>EPIC SPELLCASTING </h2><p>Once an epic spell is developed, the caster knows the spell. A developed epic spell becomes an indelible part of the caster and may be prepared without a spellbook (if a wizard is the caster). Characters who cast spells spontaneously, such as sorcerers, can cast a developed epic spell by using any open epic spell slot. Druids, clerics, and similar spellcasters can likewise prepare epic spells using epic spell slots. </p><p>A spellcaster can prepare or cast any epic spell he or she knows as many times per day as he or she has available epic spell slots. A spellcaster who can cast epic spells has a number of open epic spell slots per day equal to one-tenth his or her ranks in the Knowledge skill appropriate to the spell and the caster’s class. Knowledge (arcana) is appropriate for arcane casters, and Knowledge (religion) or Knowledge (nature) is appropriate for divine casters. The rules for rest between casting a day’s allotment of epic spells are the same as for rest required to prepare standard spells. If the caster doesn’t use up a day’s allotment of epic spell slots, the unused slots remain available whether or not the spellcaster receives appropriate rest. </p><p>Even if the epic spell has been developed and an epic spell slot is available, successfully casting an epic spell isn’t assured. The caster’s Spellcraft skill modifier is vital for casting an epic spell. To cast an epic spell, a spellcaster makes a Spellcraft check against the epic spell’s Spellcraft DC. If the check succeeds, the spell is cast. If the caster fails the check, the epic spell fizzles and the epic spell slot is used for the day. </p><p>Because epic spells require Spellcraft checks, a spell is beyond the caster’s ability if the final Spellcraft DC is greater than 20 + the spellcaster’s Spellcraft modifier. Epic spells with DCs higher than 10 + the spellcaster’s Spellcraft modifier are risky; a caster can take 10 when casting an epic spell, but he or she can’t take 20. When routinely casting epic spells, most spellcasters take 10 on their Spellcraft checks. </p><p><strong>Epic Spell Levels:</strong> Epic spells have no fixed level. However, for purposes of Concentration checks, spell resistance, and other possible situations where spell level is important, epic spells are all treated as if they were 10th-level spells. </p><p><strong>Metamagic, Items, and Epic Spells:</strong> Metamagic feats and other epic feats that manipulate normal spells cannot be used with epic spells. </p><p>A character can’t craft a magic item that casts an epic spell, regardless of whether the item is activated with spell completion, a spell trigger, a command word, or simple use. Only major artifacts, which are beyond the means of even epic characters to create, can possibly contain magic of this power. </p><p>The saving throw against a character’s epic spell has a DC of 20 + the character’s relevant ability score modifier. It’s possible to develop epic spells that have even higher DCs, however, by applying the appropriate factor. </p></section><section id="h2-5-epic-spell-terms"><h2>EPIC SPELL TERMS</h2><p><strong>Epic Spell:</strong> Spells that are different from common spells. Epic spells are usually custom-made. Epic spells do not take up normal spell slots, but instead are gained and used under a completely separate progression. </p><p><strong>Epic Spell Slots:</strong> A character must have an available epic spell slot to prepare or cast an epic spell, just as he or she needs a normal spell slot for a nonepic spell. A character doesn’t gain epic spell slots by virtue of his or her level and class, however. A character gets one epic spell slot for every 10 ranks he or she has in the relevant Knowledge skill. </p><p><strong>Factor:</strong> When creating an epic spell, a character can modify the basic use of a seed. Each modification is called a factor, and most factors increase the difficulty of casting the spell. </p><p><strong>Mitigating Factor:</strong> The opposite of a normal factor, a mitigating factor modifies the spell but makes it easier to cast. </p><p><strong>Seed:</strong> Every custom epic spell created by spellcasters begins with a base effect called a seed. Seeds are the fundamental building blocks of epic spells. </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> For epic spells, the Spellcraft DC is a measure of how difficult the spell is for a spellcaster to cast. It also measures how powerful an epic spell is. </p></section><section id="h2-6-epic-spell-formulas-and-calculations"><h2>EPIC SPELL FORMULAS AND CALCULATIONS </h2><p>The following formulas are important to epic spellcasters. </p><p><strong>Epic Spells Per Day:</strong> Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), or Knowledge (nature) ranks ÷ 10 (round down). </p><p><strong>To Cast an Epic Spell:</strong> Spellcraft check (DC = epic spell’s Spellcraft DC). </p><p><strong>Level of an Epic Spell:</strong> Epic spells are considered 10th level for the purpose of Concentration checks, spell resistance, and other determinations. </p><p><strong>Saving Throw for an Epic Spell:</strong> DC = 20 + key ability modifier. </p></section><section id="h2-7-dispelling-epic-spells-and-antimagic-field"><h2>DISPELLING,EPIC SPELLS,AND ANTIMAGIC FIELD</h2><p>A lucky nonepic spellcaster casting <i>greater dispel magic</i> might be able to dispel an epic spell. The game mechanics do not change, and epic spells do not occupy any privileged position allowing them to resist being dispelled other than their presumably high caster level. Likewise, epic spells using the <i>dispel</i> seed can dispel nonepic spells. Such epic spells use the same game mechanic: The check to dispel is 1d20 + a specified number (usually dispeller’s level), and the DC is 11 + the spellcaster’s level. </p><p><i>Antimagic field</i> does not automatically suppress epic spells as it does standard spells. Instead, each time an epic spell is subject to an <i>antimagic field,</i>make a dispel check as a 20th-level caster (1d20 + 20). The epic spell has a DC of 11 + the epic spell’s spellcaster level. If the suppression check is successful, the epic spell is suppressed like any other spell. If the dispel check is unsuccessful, the epic spell functions normally.</p></section><section id="h2-8-epic-spell-descriptions"><h2>EPIC SPELL DESCRIPTIONS</h2><p>Each epic spell description follows the same format used for 0- to 9th-level spells. There are two additional entries for epic spells: Spellcraft DC and To Develop. </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> This is the DC of the Spellcraft check required to cast the epic spell. When casting an epic spell, the character gains a +5 bonus on his or her Spellcraft check if the base seed of the epic spell is from the character’s arcane school specialty or primary psionic discipline. The character takes a –15 penalty if the epic spell seed is from his or her prohibited arcane school.</p><p><strong>To Develop:</strong> The first part of this entry shows the resources in gold, time, and experience points a character must expend to develop the spell shown. If the character expends the resources, he or she develops the spell if he or she has access to all the seeds. Spells containing the <i>life</i> or <i>heal</i> seed are typically only available to those with 24 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) or Knowledge (nature). The rest of the development entry details the seeds and factors used to create the epic spell. This information is provided as an example for characters when they attempt to create and develop their own unique epic spells. </p><section id="h3-9-animus-blast"><h3>Animus Blast </h3><p>Evocation [Cold] </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 50 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 ft. </p><p><strong>Area:</strong> 20-ft.-radius hemisphere burst </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Reflex half </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes </p><p><strong>To Develop:</strong> 450,000 gp; 9 days; 18,000 XP.

However, up to twenty of those victims that perish as a result of this blast are then instantly animated as Medium skeletons. These skeletons serve the character indefinitely. The character cannot exceed the normal limit for controlling undead through use of this spell, but other means that allow the character to exceed the normal limit for controlled undead work just as well with undead created with <i>animus blast.</i></p></section><section id="h3-10-animus-blizzard"><h3>Animus Blizzard </h3><p>Evocation [Cold] </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 78 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 ft. </p><p><strong>Area:</strong> 20-ft.-radius hemisphere burst</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Reflex half </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes </p><p><strong>To Develop:</strong> 702,000 gp; 15 days; 28,080 XP.

Factors: increase damage to 30d6 (+40 DC), set undead type to wight (–4 DC). </p><p>When this spell is cast, enemies within range are dealt 30d6 points of cold damage. However, up to five victims that perish as a result of this blast are then instantly animated as wights. These five wights serve the character indefinitely. The character cannot exceed the normal limit for controlling undead through use of this spell, but other means that allow the character to exceed the normal limit for controlled undead work just as well with undead created with <i>animus blizzard.</i></p></section><section id="h3-11-contingent-resurrection"><h3>Contingent Resurrection </h3><p>Conjuration (Healing) </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 52 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S , D F</p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch </p><p><strong>Target:</strong> You or creature touched </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Contingent until expended, then instantaneous </p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None (see text) </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (harmless) </p><p><strong>To Develop:</strong> 468,000 gp; 10 days; 18,720 XP. Seed: <i>life</i> (DC 27). Factor: activates when subject is slain (+25 DC). </p><p><i>Contingent resurrection</i> returns the subject to life if he or she is slain. Once cast, the spell remains quiescent and does not activate until the trigger conditions have been met (but each day it remains untriggered, it uses up an epic spell slot, even if the character cast it on another creature). Once triggered, the spell is expended. If the subject is killed (the trigger), he or she is restored to life and complete health 1 minute later, so long as even a tiny bit of dust remains for <i>contingent resurrection</i> to act upon. A shaft of light shines down from the heavens, illuminating the subject and everything within 20 feet. The creature is restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells. However, the subject loses one level (or 1 point of Constitution if the subject was 1st level). <i>Contingent resurrection</i> does not work on a creature that has died of old age. </p></section><section id="h3-12-create-living-vault-ritual"><h3>Create Living Vault <small>(Ritual)</small></h3><p>Conjuration (Creation) </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 58 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, XP </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 100 days, 11 minutes </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 0 ft. </p><p><strong>Effect:</strong> One living vault, 50 ft. by 50 ft. by 10 ft. </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> None </p><p><strong>To Develop:</strong> 540,000 gp; 11 days; 21,600 XP. Seeds: <i>animate</i> (DC 25) large chunk of stone, <i>fortify</i> (DC 27). Factors: allow vault to “grow” to proper size after created in 4d4 days (ad hoc +20 DC), increase HD of object by 92 (+184 DC), grant magical immunity (ad hoc +105 DC), increase damage reduction to 15 (+28 DC) and to /epic (+15 DC), make permanent (x5 DC). Mitigating factors: increase casting time by 10 minutes (–20 DC), increase casting time by 100 days (–200 DC), 9d6 backlash (–9 DC), seven additional casters contributing one epic spell slot (‑133 DC), burn 20,000 XP per epic caster (‑1,600 DC). </p><p>The character creates a construct known as a living vault to protect and hide his or her treasures. Upon completion, the vault initially measures only 5 feet on a side, but it gradually increases to its proper size over the following 4d4 days. The vault is attuned to the character, allowing him or her alone entrance and egress in a manner similar to a <i>dimension door</i> spell. When the character desires the vault to hide itself, he or she gives it a simple command. To summon the vault, the character may cast a <i>sending</i> spell or arrange some other manner to contact it. </p><p><em>XP Cost:</em> 20,000 XP. </p></section><section id="h3-13-crown-of-vermin"><h3>Crown of Vermin </h3><p>Conjuration (Summoning) </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 56 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Personal </p><p><strong>Effect:</strong> Aura of one thousand insects that surrounds you in a 10-ft.-radius spread </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 20 rounds (D) </p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None (see text) </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No </p><p><strong>To Develop:</strong> 504,000 gp; 11 days; 20,160 XP. Seeds: <i>summon</i> (DC 14), <i>fortify</i> (DC 17). Factors: summon vermin mass instead of one creature (ad hoc +8 DC), grant damage reduction 1/epic (+15 DC), allow mass to move at your speed (ad hoc +2 DC), perfect control of vermin (ad hoc +2 DC). Mitigating factor: change range to personal (–2 DC). </p><p>After casting <i>crown of vermin,</i> one thousand venomous, biting and stinging spiders, scorpions, beetles, and centipedes erupt from the very air around the character. This swarm forms a living aura around the character to a radius of 10 feet. The character is immune to his or her own <i>crown of vermin.</i>The swarm goes where the character goes at his or her speed, even if the character takes to the air or water (though water drowns the vermin after 1 full round of immersion, unless the spell is cast underwater, in which case aquatic or marine vermin answer the call and cannot leave the water). Each vermin in the <i>crown of vermin</i> bites a creature who enters the area occupied by the effect (or the character forces the effect into an area occupied by another creature) for 1 point of damage, and then dies. Each victim takes enough points of damage to kill it, destroying that number of vermin in the process. Victims get a Reflex saving throw each round to avoid the full press, and if successful, take only 10d10 bites (and 10d10 points of damage). A total of 1,000 points of damage can be dealt to those who fall prey to the <i>crown of vermin.</i>The vermin have damage reduction 1/epic, so the vermin’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If there aren’t enough vermin to kill all the creatures in the spell’s effect, the creature with the fewest hit points is affected first, then the creature with the second fewest hit points, and so on. After all creatures that can be killed have been killed, any remaining damage is distributed among the survivors equally. </p><p>The character has utter control over the vermin in his or her aura, and can force them into areas that would normally deter common vermin. The character can completely suppress his or her vermin aura as a free action so that no vermin are visible at all. The time that vermin are suppressed does not count toward the spell’s duration. Alternatively, the character can roughly shape and move the vermin in any fashion he or she desires within the limits of the 10-foot-radius spread as a move-equivalent action. The vermin cannot be wrested from the character’s control through any means. The vermin make all saving throws to avoid damaging effects using the character’s base saving throw bonuses. They gain the character’s spell resistance, if any, and they get saving throws against spells that would otherwise automatically slay vermin. A character can see through his or her <i>crown of vermin</i> without difficulty, but gains one-half concealment against enemy attacks launched both outside and within the character’s <i>crown of vermin.</i></p></section><section id="h3-14-damnation"><h3>Damnation </h3><p>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Teleportation] [Mind-Affecting] </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 97 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, XP </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action </p><p><strong>Target:</strong> Creature touched </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous (20 hours for compulsion) </p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates (see text) </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes </p><p><strong>To Develop:</strong> 873,000 gp; 18 days; 34,920 XP.

Factors: interplanar travel (+4 DC), unwilling target (+4 DC), 1-action casting time (+20 DC), +15 to DC of subject’s save (+30 DC). Mitigating factor: burn 2,400 XP (–24 DC). </p><p>The character sends his or her foe to hell. If the character succeeds at a melee touch attack, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = the standard epic spell DC + 15). If he or she fails this saving throw, he or she is sent straight to a layer of a lawful evil plane (or a chaotic evil plane, at the character’s option) swarming with fiends. The subject will not willingly leave the plane for 20 hours, believing that his or her predicament is a just reward for an ill-spent life. Even after the compulsion fades, he or she must devise his or her own escape from the plane. Unless the GM devises a specific location and scenario in the Nine Hells, the subject encounters a group of 1d4 pit fiends (or balors, if in a chaotic evil plane) every hour he or she spends in hell. </p><p><em>XP Cost:</em> 2,000 XP. </p></section><section id="h3-15-demise-unseen"><h3>Demise Unseen </h3><p>Necromancy (Death, Evil), Illusion (Figment) </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 80 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 ft. </p><p><strong>Target:</strong> One creature of up to 80 HD </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Fort negates </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes </p><p><strong>To Develop:</strong> 738,000 gp; 15 days; 29,520 XP.

The target’s companions (if any) do not immediately realize what has transpired. The target receives a Fortitude saving throw to survive the attack. If the save fails, the target remains in its exact position with no apparent ill effects. In reality, it is now a ghoul under the character’s control. The target’s companions notice nothing unusual about the state of the target until they interact with it, at which time each companion receives a Will saving throw to notice discrepancies. The ghoul serves the character indefinitely.

The character can take more than one creature along (subject to the character’s weight limit), but all must be touching each other. The character physically enters the land of dreams, leaving nothing behind. For every minute the character moves through the dream landscape, he or she can “wake” to find him or her self five miles displaced in the waking world. The character does not know precisely where he or she will come out in the waking world, nor the conditions of the waking world through which the character travels. The character knows approximately where he or she will end up based on time spent traveling in dream. <i>Dreamscape</i> can also be used to travel to other planes that contain creatures that dream, but doing this requires crossing into the dreams of outsiders, where the character is subject to the dangers of alien dream realities. This is a potentially perilous proposition. Transferring to another plane of existence requires 1d4 hours of uninterrupted journey. Any creatures touched by the character when <i>dreamscape</i> is cast also make the transition to the borders of unconscious thought. They may opt to follow the character, wander off into the dreams of others, or stumble back into the waking world (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by the character).

For each additional negative level the character bestow upon him or her self at the time of casting, the eidolon has one additional character level. No matter how many negative levels the character bestows on him or her self, the eidolon can never have more character levels than the character has (taking the negative levels into account). Treat the duplicate as the character with a number of negative levels conferred that would lower him or her to the character level of the eidolon. The eidolon is considered fresh and rested when created. It may cast any spell the character has access to, including an epic spell. Use the eidolon’s Spellcraft modifier as the basis for the number of epic spells it can cast in a day, and its effective character level as a basis for its skills, feats, and other abilities. The eidolon is effectively lower level than the character and probably can’t cast all the spells he or she knows. A powerful enough eidolon might conceivably cast the <i>eidolon</i> spell itself. The eidolon appears in whatever mundane clothing the character desires when initially conjured, but it has no other possessions. It shares part of the character’s soul, so it is the character for all intents and purposes. The character and his or her <i>eidolon</i> communicate with each other normally. Usually, the eidolon does not begrudge its brief existence, because it is still part of the character. If the eidolon is killed prior to the expiration of the spell’s duration, the character immediately regains the lost levels. Normally, the eidolon does not last long enough to threaten the character with permanent level drain. </p><p><em>XP Cost:</em> 2,500 XP. </p></section><section id="h3-22-enslave-ritual"><h3>Enslave <small>(Ritual)</small></h3><p>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting] </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 80</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, XP </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 75 ft. </p><p><strong>Target:</strong> One living creature </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Permanent</p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes </p><p><strong>To Develop:</strong> 720,000 gp; 15 days; 28,800 XP.

The character establishes a telepathic link with the subject’s mind. If the creature has a language, the character can generally force the subject to perform as he or she desires, within the limits of its abilities. If the creature has no language, the character can communicate only basic commands. The character knows what the subject is experiencing, but does not receive direct sensory input from it. A subject forced to take an action against its nature receives a saving throw with a penalty of –10 to resist taking that particular action, but if it succeeds, it still remains the character’s thrall despite its minor mutiny. Once a subject makes a successful saving throw to resist a specific order, it makes all future saving throws to resist taking that specific action without a penalty. <i>Protection from evil</i> or a similar spell can prevent the character from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so protected, but it does not prevent the establishment of <i>enslave</i> or dispel it. </p><p><em>XP Cost:</em> 2,000 XP. </p></section><section id="h3-23-epic-counterspell"><h3>Epic Counterspell </h3><p>Abjuration </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 69 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 ft. </p><p><strong>Target:</strong> One creature or object </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No </p><p><strong>To Develop:</strong> 621,000 gp; 13 days; 24,840 XP.

It has the character’s mental ability scores, but it has no physical ability scores. It senses the world through the character’s senses and communicates with him or her by thought.

In the case of prepared spells, the subject decides which spells to abandon at each level.

The subject doesn’t realize the spells or spell slots are gone until he or she tries to cast a spell and finds it unavailable.

The character’s future self is technically only a possible future self (the time stream is a maelstrom of multiple probabilities), but snatching that future self from 1 round in the future collapses probability, and the possible future becomes the definite future. The character and his or her future self are both free to act normally this round (the character has already used up the limit of one quickened spell per round, but his or her duplicate hasn’t). The future self has all the resources the character has at the moment he or she finishes casting <i>time duplicate.</i>Because the future self was previously only a possibility, his or her resources are not depleted as a result of whatever might occur this round (even if the character dies this round). Likewise, he or she doesn’t have any special knowledge of what might occur during this round. Because the future self is still part of the time stream, the round it spends with the character is a round it misses in its own future. Because the chracter’s future duplicate is also the character, the character misses the next round as well. He or she simply isn’t there. Tampering with the time stream is a tricky business. Here is a round-by-round summary. </p><p><em>Round One:</em> The character casts <i>time duplicate,</i>the future self from round two arrives, and both act normally. </p><p><em>Round Two:</em> The future self—the character—gets snatched back in time to help the past self. During this round, there are no versions of the character present. </p><p><em>Round Three:</em> The character rejoins the time stream. The character arrives in the same location and condition that the future self ended with at the end of the first round. Any resources (spells, damage, staff charges) the future self used up in round one are gone for real. Record them now. Using this spell to snatch a single future self stretches time and probability to its limit; more powerful versions of <i>time duplicate</i> are not possible. A character cannot bring more than a single future version of him or her self back at one time, nor can a character snatch a version of him or her from farther in the future. </p></section><section id="h3-52-vengeful-gaze-of-god"><h3>Vengeful Gaze of God </h3><p>Transmutation </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 419 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 12,000 ft. </p><p><strong>Target:</strong> One creature, or up to a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter in line of sight </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Fortitude half </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes </p><p><strong>To Develop:</strong> 3,771,000 gp; 76 days; 150,840 XP.

Every epic seed has a base Spellcraft DC, and every factor has a Spell-craft DC adjustment. When a desired spell is developed, the spellcaster spends resources and time to assemble the pieces that make up the epic spell. The base Spellcraft DCs of each seed are added together; then the DC adjustments of the factors are added to that total. The sum equals the final Spellcraft DC for the epic spell. </p><p>The final Spellcraft DC is the most significant gauge of the epic spell’s power. A spellcaster attempts to cast an epic spell by making a Spellcraft check against the epic spell’s Spellcraft DC. Thus, a spellcaster knows immediately, based on his or her own Spellcraft bonus, what epic spells are within his or her capability to cast, which are risky, and which are beyond him or her. Epic casters don’t commit time and money to develop epic spells until they are powerful enough to cast them. </p><p>An epic spell developed by an arcane spellcaster is arcane, and an epic spell developed by a divine spellcaster is divine. A character who can cast both divine and arcane epic spells chooses whether a particular spell he or she develops will be arcane or divine. If that same caster uses the <i>heal</i> or <i>life</i> seed in an epic spell, that spell is always considered divine. All the epic spells described here can be developed independently by a character who spends the necessary time, money, and experience points. Alternatively, a character can use those spells as a starting point when creating customized versions of the spells. </p><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Epic Seeds</caption><tbody><tr><td nowrap="" style="min-width: 6.825em; font-weight: 700;">Seed</td><td style="min-width: 6.75em; font-weight: 700;">Base Spellcraft DC</td><td nowrap="" style="min-width: 7.875em; font-weight: 700;">Seed</td><td style="min-width: 5.625em; font-weight: 700;">Base Spellcraft DC</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Afflict</td><td nowrap="">14</td><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Energy </td><td nowrap="">19</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Animate </td><td nowrap="">25</td><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Foresee </td><td nowrap="">17</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Animate dead</td><td nowrap="">23</td><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Fortify </td><td nowrap="">17</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Armor </td><td nowrap="">14</td><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Heal*</td><td nowrap="">25</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Banish </td><td nowrap="">27</td><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Life*</td><td nowrap="">27</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Compel </td><td nowrap="">19</td><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Reflect </td><td nowrap="">27</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Conceal </td><td nowrap="">17</td><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Reveal </td><td nowrap="">19</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Conjure </td><td nowrap="">21</td><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Slay </td><td nowrap="">25</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Contact </td><td nowrap="">23</td><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Summon </td><td nowrap="">14</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Delude </td><td nowrap="">14</td><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Transform </td><td nowrap="">21</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Destroy </td><td nowrap="">29</td><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Transport </td><td nowrap="">27</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Dispel </td><td nowrap="">19</td><td nowrap="" style="font-style: italic;">Ward </td><td nowrap="">14</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>*Spellcasters without at least 24 ranks in Knowledge (religion) or Knowledge (nature) may not use <i>heal</i> or <i>life</i> spell seeds.</p><p><strong>Resource Cost:</strong> The development of an epic spell uses up raw materials costing a number of gold pieces equal to 9,000 xthe final Spellcraft DC of the epic spell being developed. </p><p><strong>Development Time:</strong> Developing an epic spell takes one day for each 50,000 gp in resources required to develop the spell, rounded up to whole days. </p><p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> To develop an epic spell, a character must spend 1/25 of its resource price in experience points. </p><p><strong>Adding Seed DCs:</strong> When two or more epic seeds are combined in an epic spell, their base Spellcraft DCs are added together. Both contribute toward the spell’s final Spellcraft DC. </p><p><strong>Determining School:</strong> When combining two or more seeds to develop an epic spell, the school of the finished spell is decided by the caster from among the seeds that make up the epic spell. </p><p><strong>Combining Descriptors:</strong> When two or more epic seeds are combined in an epic spell, all the descriptors from each seed apply to the finished spell. </p><p><strong>Combining Components and Casting Times:</strong> Almost every epic spell has verbal and somatic components and a 1-minute casting time, regardless of the number of epic seeds combined. The only exceptions are epic spells with the <i>heal</i> and <i>life</i> seeds, which have divine focus components. </p><p><strong>Combining Range, Targets, Area, and Effect:</strong> One seed might have a range of 12,000 feet, another seed might have a range of 400 feet, and a third seed might not have a range at all. Likewise, some seeds have targets, while others have an effect or an area. To determine which seed takes precedence in the finished epic spell, the character must decide which seed is the base seed. The seed most important to the spell’s overall purpose is the base seed, and it determines the casting time, range, target, and so on. The other seeds apply only their specific effects to the finished spell. It is occasionally difficult to determine a base seed by examining the spell’s effects. If no one seed is most important, simply pick one seed for the purposes of making this determination. </p><p><strong>Combining Durations:</strong> When combining two or more seeds to develop an epic spell, the seed with the shortest duration determines the duration of the finished epic spell. If any seed of an epic spell is dismissible by the caster, the epic spell is dismissible. </p><p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Even if more than one seed has an associated saving throw, the final spell will have only a single saving throw. If two or more seeds have the same kind of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will), then obviously that will be used for the spell’s saving throw. If the seeds have different kinds of saving throws, simply choose the saving throw that seems most appropriate for the final spell. </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> When combining two or more seeds to develop an epic spell, if even one seed is subject to spell resistance, the finished epic spell is subject to it as well. </p><p><strong>Factors:</strong> Factors are not part of epic seeds, but they are the tools used to modify specific parameters of any given seed. Applying factors to the seeds of an epic spell can increase or decrease the final Spellcraft DC, increase the duration, change the area of a spell, and affect many other aspects of the spell. </p><p>There are three kinds of factors: </p><p>1. Those that can affect a number of seeds. </p><p>2. Those that can only be used with specific seeds. </p><p>3. Those that reduce the Spellcraft DC rather than increasing it. These are referred to as mitigating factors. To calculate the final Spellcraft DC of an epic spell correctly, it’s important to determine the mitigating factors last, after all the factors that increase the DC have been accounted for. </p><p><strong>Development Is an Art:</strong> Many times developing a completely new epic spell requires some guesswork and rule stretching. As with making and pricing magic items, a sort of balancing act is required. Often the description of a seed will need to be stretched for a particular spell. If necessary, assess an “ad hoc” Spellcraft DC adjustment for any effect that cannot be extrapolated from the seeds and factors presented here—the example spells use ad hoc factors frequently. In all cases, the GM determines the actual Spellcraft DC of the new spell</p><p><strong>Approval:</strong> This is the final step, and it’s critically important. The epic spell development work and reasoning must be shown to the GM and receive his or her approval. If the GM doesn’t approve, then the epic spell cannot be developed. However, the GM should explain why the epic spell wasn’t approved and possibly offer suggestions on how to create an epic spell that will be acceptable. </p><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Epic Spell Factors</caption><tbody><tr><td nowrap="" style="min-width: 5.925em;"></td><td nowrap="" style="min-width: 1.5em; font-weight: 700;">Spellcraft DC Modifier</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Casting Time</td><td nowrap=""></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Reduce casting time by 1 round (minimum 1 round)</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">1-action casting time</td><td nowrap="">+20</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Quickened spell (limit one quickened action/round)</td><td nowrap="">+28</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Contingent on specific trigger<sup>1</sup></td><td nowrap="">+25</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Components No verbal component</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">No somatic component</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-weight: 700;"><i>Duration</i><sup>2</sup></td><td nowrap=""></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Increase duration by 100%</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Permanent duration (apply this factor after all other epic spell factors but before mitigating factors)</td><td nowrap="">x5</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Dismissible by caster (if not already)</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Range Increase range by 100%</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-weight: 700;"><i>Target</i><sup>3</sup></td><td nowrap=""></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Add extra target within 300 ft.</td><td nowrap="">+10</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Change from target to area (pick area option below)</td><td nowrap="">+10</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Change from personal to area (pick area option below)</td><td nowrap="">+15</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Change from target to touch or ray (300-ft. range)</td><td nowrap="">+4</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Change from touch or ranged touch attack to target</td><td nowrap="">+4</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-weight: 700;"><i>Area</i><sup>4</sup></td><td nowrap=""></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Change area to bolt (5 ft. x300 ft. or 10 ft. x150 ft.)</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Change area to cylinder (10-ft. radius, 30 ft. high)</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Change area to 40-ft. cone</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Change area to four 10-ft. cubes</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Change area to 20-ft. radius</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Change area to target</td><td nowrap="">+4</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Change area to touch or ray (close range)</td><td nowrap="">+4</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Increase area by 100%</td><td nowrap="">+4</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Saving Throw</td><td nowrap=""></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Increase spell’s saving throw DC by +1</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Spell Resistance</td><td nowrap=""></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Gain +1 bonus on caster level check to overcome target’s spell resistance</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Gain +1 on caster level check to beat foe’s dispel effect</td><td nowrap="">+2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="" style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic;">Other</td><td nowrap=""></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Recorded onto stone tablet<sup>5</sup></td><td nowrap="">x2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Increase damage die by one step (d20 maximum)</td><td nowrap="">+10</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Unless stated otherwise, the same factor can be applied more than once. </p><p>1 Each contingent spell in use counts as a slot used from the caster’s daily epic spell slots. </p><p>2 Seeds that already have an instantaneous or permanent duration cannot be increased. </p><p>3 When changing a targeted or area seed to a touch or ranged attack, the seed no longer requires a save if it deals damage, instead requiring a successful attack roll.

The GM determines the most appropriate kind of saving throw for the epic spell. </p><p>5 Epic spells may only be inscribed on stone tablets or other substances of equal or greater hardness. Once a spell is so inscribed, another epic spellcaster can learn it without going through the process of development. Once an inscribed epic spell is learned by another epic spellcaster in this fashion, the tablet upon which it is inscribed is destroyed and cannot be mended. </p><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Epic Spell Mitigating Factors</caption><tbody><tr><td nowrap="" style="min-width: 5.475em;"></td><td style="min-width: 1.95em; font-weight: 700;">Spellcraft DC Modifier</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Backlash 1d6 points of damage (max d6 = caster’s HD x2)<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td><td nowrap="">–1</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Burn 100 XP during casting (max 20,000 XP)</td><td nowrap="">–1</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Increase casting time by 1 minute (max 10 minutes)<sup style="font-weight: 700;">2</sup></td><td nowrap="">–2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Increase casting time by 1 day (max 100 days)<sup style="font-weight: 700;">2</sup></td><td nowrap="">–2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Change from target, touch, or area to personal</td><td nowrap="">–2</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Additional participants (ritual)</td><td>see Table: Additional Participants in Rituals</td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">Decrease damage die by one step (d4 minimum)</td><td nowrap="">–5</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Note: Mitigating factors are always applied after all epic spell factors (see above) are accounted for in the development of an epic spell.</p><p>1 The caster cannot somehow avoid or make him or her self immune to backlash damage. For spells with durations longer than instantaneous, the backlash damage is per round. If backlash damage kills a caster, no spell or method exists that will return life to the caster’s body without costing the caster a level—not even <i>wish, true resurrection, miracle,</i> or epic spells that return life to the deceased. Spells that normally penalize the recipient one level when they return him or her to life penalize a caster killed by backlash two levels. </p><p>2 When increasing the casting time of a spell in order to reduce the Spellcraft DC, a character must first “use up” the maximum of 10 minutes (for a total DC modifier of –20). After that, a character can continue to add days to the casting time, with a further modifier of –2 per day, up to the maximum of 100 days.</p><p><strong>Additional Participants:</strong> Epic spells can be developed that specifically require additional participants. These spells are called rituals. An epic spell developed as a ritual requires a specific number of additional participants, who each must use up one spell slot of a specified level for the day. During an epic spell’s development, the spell’s creator determines the number of additional participants and the level of the spell slots to be contributed. If the exact number of spellcasters does not partake in the casting, or if the casters do not each contribute the proper spell slot, the epic spell automatically fails. To participate, each participant readies an action to contribute his or her raw spell energy when the primary caster begins the epic spell. Additional participants in a ritual spell reduce the Spellcraft DC, as shown on Table: Additional Participants in Rituals. Each additional participant may only contribute one spell slot. It doesn’t matter whether the additional participants are arcane or divine spellcasters; only the level of the spell slot contributed matters. A contributed spell slot is treated as if normally cast. A wizard may contribute either a prepared, uncast spell slot, or an open, unprepared slot. The Spellcraft DC adjustments for each additional participant stack. </p><p><em>Special:</em> A ritual epic spell that takes longer than 1 standard action to cast requires all extra participants to stand as if casting for the same amount of time. If an extra participant is attacked while contributing a spell slot, the participant must make a Concentration check as if casting a spell of the same level as the slot contributed. If the attack disrupts the participant in the ritual, the epic spell is not necessarily ruined. However, the Spellcraft DC reduction that would have been provided by that additional participant cannot be applied to the final Spellcraft DC of the epic spell. Thus the ritual epic spell will be harder for the primary spellcaster to cast. </p><div class="table-container"><table><caption>Table: Additional Participants in Rituals</caption><tbody><tr><td style="min-width: 7.275em; font-weight: 700;">Spell Slot Level Contributed</td><td style="min-width: 6.3em; font-weight: 700;">Spellcraft DC Reduction </td><td style="min-width: 7.2em; font-weight: 700;">Spell Slot Level Contributed</td><td style="min-width: 6.3em; font-weight: 700;">Spellcraft DC Reduction </td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">1st</td><td nowrap="">–1 </td><td nowrap="">6th</td><td nowrap="">–11 </td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">2nd</td><td nowrap="">–3 </td><td nowrap="">7th</td><td nowrap="">–13 </td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">3rd</td><td nowrap="">–5 </td><td nowrap="">8th</td><td nowrap="">–15 </td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">4th</td><td nowrap="">–7</td><td nowrap="">9th</td><td nowrap="">–17 </td></tr><tr><td nowrap="">5th</td><td nowrap="">–9 </td><td nowrap="">Epic slot</td><td nowrap="">–19 </td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h1-56-seed-descriptions"><h1>SEED DESCRIPTIONS </h1><p>Each seed description hereafter follows the same format used for 0- to 9th-level spells.

For each additional –1 penalty assessed on either the target’s attack rolls, checks, or saving throws, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. A character may also develop a spell with this seed that afflicts the target with a –1 penalty on caster level checks, a –1 penalty to an ability score, a –1 penalty to spell resistance, or a –1 penalty to some other aspect of the target. For each additional –1 penalty assessed in one of the above categories, increase the Spell-craft DC by +4. This seed can afflict a character’s ability scores to the point where they reach 0, except for Constitution where 1 is the minimum. If a factor is applied to increase the duration of this seed, ability score penalties instead become temporary ability damage. If a factor is applied to make the duration permanent, any ability score penalties become permanent ability drain. Finally, by increasing the Spellcraft DC by +2, one of the target’s senses can be afflicted: sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, or a special sense the target possesses. If the target fails its saving throw, the sense selected doesn’t function for the spell’s duration, with all attendant penalties that apply for losing the specified sense. </p></section><section id="h2-58-seed-animate"><h2>SEED:ANIMATE </h2><p>Transmutation </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 25 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 ft. </p><p><strong>Target:</strong> Object or 20 cu. ft. of matter </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 20 rounds </p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No </p><p>This seed can imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life (not actual life).

The undead can follow the caster, or they can remain in an area and attack any creature (or a specific type of creature) entering the place. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed. (A destroyed undead can’t be animated again.) Intelligent undead can follow more sophisticated commands. The <i>animate dead</i> seed allows a character to create 20 HD of undead. For each additional 1 HD of undead created, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1. The undead created remain under the caster’s control indefinitely. A caster can naturally control 1 HD per caster level of undead creatures he or she has personally created, regardless of the method used. If the caster exceeds this number, newly created creatures fall under his or her control, and excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled (the caster chooses which creatures are released). If the caster is a cleric, any undead he or she commands through his or her ability to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit. For each additional 2 HD of undead to be controlled, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1. Only undead in excess of 20 HD created with this seed can be controlled using this DC adjustment. To both create and control more than 20 HD of undead, increase the Spellcraft DC by +3 per additional 2 HD of undead. </p><p>Type of Undead: All types of undead can be created with the <i>animate dead</i> seed, although creating more powerful undead increases the Spellcraft DC of the epic spell, according to the table below.

To compel a creature to follow an outright unreasonable course of action, increase the Spellcraft DC by +10. The compelled course of activity can continue for the entire duration.

To create invisibility that lasts regardless of the actions of the subject, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. Alternatively, this seed can conceal the exact location of the subject so that it appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location; this increases the Spellcraft DC by +2. The subject benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. However, unlike actual total concealment, this displacement effect does not prevent enemies from targeting him or her normally. The <i>conceal</i> seed can also be used to block divination spells, spell-like effects, and epic spells developed using the <i>reveal</i> seed; this increases the Spellcraft DC by +6.

The subject recognizes the caster if it knows him or her. It can answer in like manner immediately, though it does not have to. The caster can forge a communal bond among more than two creatures. For each additional creature contacted, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1. The bond can be established only among willing subjects, which therefore receive no saving throw or spell resistance. For telepathic communication through the bond regardless of language, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. No special influence is established as a result of the bond, only the power to communicate at a distance. </p><p>At the base Spellcraft DC of 20, a caster can also use the <i>contact</i> seed to imbue an object (or creature) with a message he or she prepares that appears as written text for the spell’s duration or is spoken aloud in a language the caster knows. The spoken message can be of any length, but the length of written text is limited to what can be contained (as text of a readable size) on the surface of the target.

The caster can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect by concentrating (the image is otherwise stationary). The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless the caster causes the illusion to react appropriately. For an illusion that includes audible, olfactory, tactile, taste, and thermal aspects, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2 per extra aspect. Even realistic tactile and thermal illusions can’t deal damage, however. For each additional image to be created, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1. For an illusion that follows a script determined by the caster, increase the Spellcraft DC by +9. The figment follows the script without the caster having to concentrate on it. The illusion can include intelligible speech if desired. For an illusion that makes any area appear to be something other than it is, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4.

Up to a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter is affected, so a spell using the <i>destroy</i> seed destroys only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The <i>destroy</i> seed affects even magical matter, energy fields, and force effects that are normally only affected by the <i>disintegrate</i> spell. Such effects are automatically destroyed. Epic spells using the <i>ward</i> seed may also be destroyed, though the caster must succeed at an opposed caster level check against the other spellcaster to bring down a <i>ward</i> spell. </p></section><section id="h2-68-seed-dispel"><h2>SEED: DISPEL </h2><p>Abjuration </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 19 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 ft. </p><p><strong>Target:</strong> One creature, object, or spell </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous </p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No </p><p>This seed can end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. The <i>dispel</i> seed can defeat all spells, even those not normally subject to <i>dispel magic.</i>The <i>dispel</i> seed can dispel (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as spells, and it affects spell-like effects just as it affects spells. One creature, object, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel</i> seed. The caster makes a dispel check against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. A dispel check is 1d20 + 10 against a DC of 11 + the target spell’s caster level. For each additional +1 on the dispel check, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1. If targeting an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell, make a dispel check to end the spell that affects the object or creature. If the object targeted is a magic item, make a dispel check against the item’s caster level. If succeessful, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface is temporarily closed. A magic item’s physical properties are unchanged. Any creature, object, or spell is potentially subject to the <i>dispel</i> seed, even the spells of gods and the abilities of artifacts. A character automatically succeeds on the dispel check against any spell that he or she cast him or her self. </p></section><section id="h2-69-seed-energy"><h2>SEED: ENERGY </h2><p>Evocation [Acid, Fire, Electricity, Cold, or Sonic] </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 19 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 ft. or touched creature or object of 2,000 lb. or less </p><p><strong>Area:</strong> A bolt 5 ft. wide to 300 ft. long; or a 10-ft.-radius emanation; or a wall whose area is up to one 200-ft. square; or a sphere or hemi-sphere with a radius of up to 20 ft. </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous or 20 hours (see text)</p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Reflex half </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes </p><p>This seed uses whichever one of five energy types the caster chooses: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The caster can cast the energy forth as a bolt, imbue an object with the energy, or create a freestanding manifestation of the energy. If the spell developed using the <i>energy</i> seed releases a bolt, that bolt instantaneously deals 10d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy type, and all in the bolt’s area must make a Reflex save for half damage. For each additional 1d6 points of damage dealt, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The bolt begins at the caster’s fingertips. To imbue another creature with the ability to use an energy bolt as a spell-like ability at its option or when a particular condition is met, increase the Spellcraft DC by +25. The caster can also cause a creature or object to emanate the specific energy type out to a radius of 10 feet for 20 hours. The emanated energy deals 2d6 points of energy damage per round against unprotected creatures (the target creature is susceptible if not separately warded or otherwise resistant to the energy). For each additional 1d6 points of damage emanated, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The caster may also create a wall, half-circle, circle, dome, or sphere of the desired energy that emanates the energy for up to 20 hours. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of energy, dealing 2d4 points of energy damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of energy damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and in each round that a creature enters or remains in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6+20 points of energy damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures. For each additional 1d4 points of damage, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. </p><p>The caster can also use the <i>energy</i> seed to create a spell that carefully releases and balances the emanation of cold, electricity, and fire, creating specific weather effects for a period of 20 hours. Using the <i>energy</i> seed this way has a base Spellcraft DC of 25. The area extends to a two-mile-radius centered on the caster. Once the spell is cast, the weather takes 10 minutes to manifest. Ordinarily, a caster can’t directly target a creature or object, though indirect effects are possible. This seed can create cold snaps, heat waves, thunderstorms, fogs, blizzards—even a tornado that moves randomly in the affected area. Creating targeted damaging effects requires an additional use of the <i>energy</i> seed. </p></section><section id="h2-70-seed-foresee"><h2>SEED: FORESEE </h2><p>Divination </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 17 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Personal </p><p><strong>Target:</strong> You </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous or concentration (see text) </p><p>The caster can foretell the immediate future, or gain information about specific questions.

For better results, the caster can pose up to ten specific questions (one per round while he or she concentrates) to unknown powers of other planes, but the base Spellcraft DC for such an attempt is 23. The answers return in a language the caster understands, but use only one-word replies: “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or some other one-word answer. Unlike 0- to 9th-level spells of similar type, all questions answered are 90% likely to be answered truthfully. However, a specific spell using the <i>foresee</i> seed can only be cast once every five weeks. The <i>foresee</i> seed is also useful for epic spells requiring specific information before functioning, such as spells using the <i>reveal</i> and <i>transport</i> seeds. The <i>foresee</i> seed can also be used to gain one basic piece of information about a living target: level, class, alignment, or some special ability (or one of an object’s magical abilities, if any).

The caster must have at least a reliable description of the place to which he or she is transporting. If the caster attempts to use the <i>transport</i> seed with insufficient or misleading information, the character disappears and simply reappear in his or her original location. </p><p>As a special use of the <i>transport</i> seed, a caster can develop a spell that temporarily transports him or her into a different time stream (leaving the caster in the same physical location); this increases the Spellcraft DC by +8. If the caster moves him or herself, or the subject, into a slower time stream for 5 rounds, time ceases to flow for the subject, and its condition becomes fixed—no force or effect can harm it until the duration expires. If the caster moves him or her self into a faster time stream, the caster speeds up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. The caster is free to act for 5 rounds of apparent time. Fire, cold, poison gas, and similar effects can still harm the caster. While the caster is in the fast time stream, other creatures are invulnerable to his or her attacks and spells; however, the caster can create spell effects and leave them to take effect when he or she reenters normal time. Because of the branching nature of time, epic spells used to transport a subject into a faster time stream cannot be made permanent, nor can the duration of 5 rounds be extended. More simply, the seed can <i>haste</i> or <i>slow</i> a subject for 20 rounds by transporting it to the appropriate time stream. This decreases the Spellcraft DC by –4. </p></section><section id="h2-80-seed-ward"><h2>SEED: WARD </h2><p>Abjuration </p><p><strong>Spellcraft DC:</strong> 14 </p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute </p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch </p><p><strong>Target or Effect:</strong> Touched creature or object of 2,000 lb. or less; or 10-ft.-radius spherical emanation, centered on you </p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours </p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None </p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes </p><p>This seed can grant a creature protection from damage of a specified type. The caster can protect a creature from standard damage or from energy damage. The caster can protect a creature or area from magic. Alternatively, he or she can hedge out a type of creature from a specified area. A ward against standard damage protects a creature from whichever two the caster selects of the three damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. For a ward against all three types, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. Each round, the spell created with the <i>ward</i> seed absorbs the first 5 points of damage the creature would otherwise take, regardless of whether the source of the damage is natural or magical. For each additional point of protection, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. </p><p>A ward against energy grants a creature protection from whichever one the caster selects of the five energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Each round, the spell absorbs the first 5 points of damage the creature would otherwise take from the specified energy type, regardless of whether the source of damage is natural or magical. The spell protects the recipient’s equipment as well. For each additional point of protection, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1. </p><p>A ward against a specific type of creature prevents bodily contact from whichever one of several monster types the caster selects. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or intentionally moves within 5 feet of the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature. </p><p>A ward against magic creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere (with radius 10 feet) that surrounds the caster and excludes all spell effects of up to 1st level. Alternatively, the caster can ward just the target and not create the radius effect. For each additional level of spells to be excluded, increase the Spellcraft DC by +20 (but see below). The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the ward, and such spells fail to affect any target within the ward. This includes spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from magic items. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the ward. The caster can leave and return to the protected area without penalty (unless the spell specifically targets a creature and does not provide a radius effect). The ward could be brought down by a targeted <i>dispel magic</i> spell. Epic spells using the <i>dispel</i> seed may bring down a ward if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a caster level check. The ward may also be brought down with a targeted epic spell using the <i>destroy</i> seed if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a caster level check. </p><p>Instead of creating an epic spell that uses the <i>ward</i> seed to nullify all spells of a given level and lower, the caster can create a ward that nullifies a specific spell (or specific set of spells). For each specific spell so nullified, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2 per spell level above 1st. </p></section></section><section id="h1-81-epic-psionic-powers"><h1>EPIC PSIONIC POWERS </h1><p>The following adjustments should be made if taking psionic characters to epic levels.</p><section id="h3-82-epic-psionic-seeds"><h3>Epic Psionic Seeds </h3><p>Psionic characters can acquire epic powers.

The spellcaster determines factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This spell cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth). The spellcaster must add these things in some other fashion if he or she desires.
