This synergy bonus increases by +2 for every additional 20 ranks the character has in the skill. </p></section><section id="h2-2-skill-descriptions"><h2>SKILL DESCRIPTIONS </h2><p>This section describes new DCs and new modifiers for skills. </p><section id="h3-3-appraise"><h3>Appraise </h3><p>The character can sense magical auras in objects. </p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Task</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">DC </td></tr><tr><td>Detect magic</td><td>50 </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Detect Magic:</strong>The character can sense if an item has a magical aura.

It can be sensed as if it were an enchantment effect (Sense Motive DC 25). </p><p><strong>Display False Alignment:</strong>The character can fool alignment-sensing effects by displaying a false alignment of his or her choice. Once set, a false alignment remains as long as the character remains conscious and awake. Setting or changing a false alignment requires a full-round action. </p><p><strong>Disguise Surface Thoughts:</strong>The character can fool spells such as <i>detect thoughts</i> (or similar effects) by displaying false surface thoughts. While the character can’t completely mask the presence of his or her thoughts, he or she can change his or her apparent Intelligence score (and thus the character’s apparent mental strength) by as much as 10 points and can place any thought in his or her “surface thoughts” to be read by such spells or effects. If a character attempts to use Sense Motive to detect his or her surface thoughts (see the Sense Motive skill description), this becomes an opposed check (though any result lower than 100 automatically fails). </p></section><section id="h3-6-climb"><h3>Climb </h3><p>The character can climb otherwise unclimbable surfaces. </p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">DC</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Surface </td></tr><tr><td>70</td><td>A perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surface </td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>A perfectly smooth, flat, overhang or ceiling </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Rapid Climbing:</strong>A character can climb his or her speed as a move-equivalent action, or double his or her speed as a full-round action (requiring two Climb checks), but the character takes a –20 penalty on his or her check. </p><p>Special: The Legendary Climber feat allows a character to ignore any penalties for accelerated or rapid climbing. </p></section><section id="h3-7-concentration"><h3>Concentration </h3><p>The character can cast spells with somatic components even while grappled. </p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td style="min-width: 21.8251em; font-weight: 700;">Task</td><td style="min-width: 9em; font-weight: 700;">DC </td></tr><tr><td>Cast spell with somatic component while grappled</td><td>50 + spell level </td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h3-8-craft"><h3>Craft </h3><p>The character can craft items more quickly than normal. </p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Task</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">DC </td></tr><tr><td>Quick creation</td><td>+10 or more to DC </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Quick Creation:</strong> A character can voluntarily increase the DC of crafting an item by any multiple of 10.

If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage, double the duration of its effect. If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage and doesn’t have a specific listed duration (or has an instantaneous duration), double all dimensions of its area. If the item or substance doesn’t fit any of these categories, then it cannot be improved in this manner. A character can create an item with multiple degrees of augmentation. For every additional multiplier applied to damage, duration, or area, add an additional +20 to the DC and add an additional 5 to the cost multiplier. </p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Item</td><td style="min-width: 19.2em; font-weight: 700;">Effect of Augmenting </td></tr><tr><td>Acid</td><td>Direct hit 2d6, splash 2 </td></tr><tr><td>Alchemist’s fire</td><td>Direct hit 2d6, splash 2 </td></tr><tr><td>Antitoxin</td><td>Duration 2 hours </td></tr><tr><td>Smokestick</td><td>Smoke fills a 20-foot cube </td></tr><tr><td>Sunrod</td><td>Glows for 12 hours </td></tr><tr><td>Tanglefoot bag </td><td>Becomes brittle and fragile after 20 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Tindertwig</td><td>No effect </td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h3-10-decipher-script"><h3>Decipher Script </h3><p>The character can decipher magic scrolls. </p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td style="min-width: 15.825em; font-weight: 700;">Task</td><td style="min-width: 12.6em; font-weight: 700;">DC </td></tr><tr><td>Decipher a written spell (such as a scroll) without using <i>read magic.</i>One try per day.</td><td>50 + 5 times spell level </td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h3-11-diplomacy"><h3>Diplomacy </h3><p>The character can turn a person into a fanatic follower.
