The creature can make another Will saving throw to resist the <i>suggestion,</i> using the save DC of the <i>brain spider</i> spell. (Creatures with special resistance to enchantment spells can use this resistance to keep from being affected by the <i>suggestion.</i>) Success on this saving throw does not negate the other effects of the <i>brain spider</i> spell for that creature.</p><p>You can affect all intelligent beings of your choice within range (up to the limit of eight), beginning with known or named beings. Language is not a barrier, and you need not personally know the beings The spell cannot reach those who make a successful Will save.</p><p><em>Material Component:</em> A spider of any size or kind. It can be dead, but must still have all eight legs.</p></section><section id="h3-19-dweomer-of-transference"><h3>Dweomer of Transference</h3><p>Evocation</p><p><strong>Level:</strong> Cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><strong>Target:</strong> One willing psionic creature</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round/level</p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates (harmless)</p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (harmless)</p><p>With this spell, you form a radiating corona around the head of a psionic ally, then convert some of your spells into psionic power points. When you finish casting <i>dweomer of transference,</i> a red-orange glow surrounds the psionic creature’s head. For the duration of the spell, any spells cast at the subject don’t have their usual effect, instead converting themselves harmlessly into psionic energy that the subject can use as energy for psionic powers. You can cast any spell you like at the subject, even area spells, effect spells, and spells for whom the subject would ordinarily not be a legitimate target. The spells don’t do anything other than provide the subject with power points, but you must still cast them normally, obeying the component and range requirements listed in the description of each spell.</p><p>For each spell you cast into the <i>dweomer of transference,</i> the psionic creature gets temporary power points, according to the following table. The transference isn’t perfectly efficient. The temporary power points acquired through a <i>dweomer of transference</i> dissipate after 1 hour if they haven’t already been spent.</p><div class="table-container"><table data-debug="no-caption"><tbody><tr><td style="min-width: 6.3em; font-weight: 700;">Spell Level</td><td style="min-width: 7.125em; font-weight: 700;">Power Points Acquired</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>16</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h3-20-glossolalia"><h3>Glossolalia</h3><p>Evocation [Sonic, Mind-Affecting]</p><p><strong>Level:</strong> Bard 2</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 ft.</p><p><strong>Area:</strong> Cone-shaped burst</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Fortitude partial; see text</p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</p><p>You utter shrieks of nonsense and gibberish that thinking creatures find distracting and confusing.

You can learn the answer to one question per round, to the best of the subject’s knowledge. You can also probe a sleeping subject, though the subject may make a Will save against the DC of the <i>probe thoughts</i> spell to wake after each question. Subjects who do not wish to be probed can attempt to move beyond the power’s range, unless somehow hindered. You pose the questions telepathically, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly to your mind. You and the target do not need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only appropriate visual images in answer to your questions.</p></section><section id="h3-23-psychic-turmoil"><h3>Psychic Turmoil</h3><p>Abjuration</p><p><strong>Level:</strong> Cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M</p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p><p><strong>Area:</strong> 40-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round/level</p><p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will partial; see text</p><p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</p><p>With this spell, you create an invisible field that leeches away the power points of psionic characters standing within the emanation.
