Some items, once they are carried or worn, function constantly. In most cases, using an item requires a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. By contrast, power completion items (see below) are treated just like powers in combat and do provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>Activating a psionic item is a standard action unless the item description indicates otherwise. The manifesting time of a power is the time required to activate the same power in an item, whether it’s a power stone, a dorje, or a psionic tattoo, unless the item description specifically states otherwise.</p><p>The four ways to activate psionic items are described below.</p><p><strong>Power Completion:</strong> This is the activation method for power stones. A power stone holds a power that is mostly finished. All that’s left to do is perform the short, simple, finishing parts of the manifestation (the final mental coda, as it were). To use a power completion item safely, a character must be of high enough level in the appropriate class to manifest the power already. If he can’t already manifest the power, there’s a chance he’ll make a mistake (see Brainburn in the power stone description). Activating a power completion item is a standard action and provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as manifesting a power does.</p><p>Powers stored in power completion items are usually not augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to be the minimum necessary to manifest the stored power. However, an item’s description may specify otherwise (some power stones have manifester levels higher than the minimum required to manifest the stored power, and are then assumed to be augmented as well).</p><p><strong>Power Trigger:</strong> This is the activation method for dorjes and psicrowns. It requires the special knowledge of power manifestation that a character of the appropriate class would know, and the formation of the appropriate command thought. If a power is on a character’s power list, the character knows how to use a power trigger item that stores that power. The user must still determine what power is stored in the item before she can activate it. Activating a power trigger item is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>Powers stored in power trigger items are not augmented. Such powers are assumed to be stored in the item at the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. However, certain items may specify a higher manifester level than necessary. If such an item holds a power that deals hit point damage, the power is assumed to be augmented to the maximum allowed by the power and the manifester level.</p><p><strong>Command Thought:</strong> If no activation method is suggested either in the psionic item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command thought is needed to activate it. Command thought activation means that a character mentally projects a thought, and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed. Activating a command thought psionic item is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. </p><p>Sometimes the command thought to activate an item is mentally imprinted within it and is whispered into the mind of a creature who picks it up. Other items are silent, but a Knowledge (psionics) or Knowledge (history) check might be useful in helping to identify command thoughts. A successful DC 30 check is needed to come up with the command thought in this case. The power <i>psionic identify</i> reveals command thoughts.</p><p>Powers stored in command thought items are usually not augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.</p><p><strong>Use-Activated:</strong> This type of psionic item simply has to be used to activate. Use activation is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.</p><p>Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Some items made for wearing must still be activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a command thought (see above), usually it means mentally willing the activation to happen (a free action). The description of an item states whether a command thought is needed in such a case.</p><p>Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated psionic item is either a standard action or not an action at all and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an action that provokes attacks of opportunity in itself. If the use of the item takes time before a psionic effect occurs, then use activation is a standard action. If the item’s activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time, use activation is not an action at all.</p><p>Use activation doesn’t mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes automatically.</p><p>Powers stored in use-activated items are usually not augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.</p></section><section id="h2-2-saving-throws-against-psionic-item-powers"><h2>SAVING THROWS AGAINST PSIONIC ITEM POWERS</h2><p>Psionic items produce psionic powers. The DC of a saving throw against a power from a psionic item is always 10 + the level of the power or effect + the ability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to manifest that level of power.</p><p>Another way to figure the same number is to multiply the power’s level by 1-1/2 and add 10 to the result.</p><p>Psicrowns are an exception to the rule. Treat the saving throw as if the wielder manifested the power, including caster level and all modifiers to save DC.</p><p>Some psionic items take advantage of the fact that powers can be augmented to increase their saving throw DCs. These items are special and have their cost to create and market price calculated using the manifester’s level instead of the power’s level.</p><p>Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various effects, particularly when the effect has no exact power equivalent (making its level otherwise difficult to quickly determine).</p></section><section id="h2-3-damaging-psionic-items"><h2>DAMAGING PSIONIC ITEMS</h2><p>A psionic item doesn’t need to make a saving throw unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his saving throw. Psionic items should always get a save against powers or spells that might deal damage to them—even against attacks from which a mundane item would normally get no chance to save. All types of psionic item saves—Fortitude, Reflex, and Will—are calculated the same way: The item’s saving throw bonus equals 2 + 1/2 its manifester level (round down). The only exceptions to this rule are intelligent psionic items, which make Will saves based on their own Wisdom scores.</p><p>A psionic item, unless otherwise noted, takes damage as a normal item of the same type. A damaged psionic item continues to function, but if it is destroyed, all its psionic power is lost.</p><section id="h3-4-repairing-items"><h3>REPAIRING ITEMS</h3><p>Some psionic items (especially psionic weapons and shields) may take damage over the course of an adventure. It costs no more to repair a psionic item with the Craft skill than it does to repair its nonpsionic counterpart. The <i>make whole</i> spell can repair a damaged—but not completely broken— psionic item.</p></section></section><section id="h2-5-intelligent-items"><h2>INTELLIGENT ITEMS</h2><p>Some psionic items, particularly weapons, have an intelligence all their own. Only permanent psionic items (as opposed to those that are single-use items, those that have charges, or those that store power points) can be intelligent. (This means that psionic tattoos, power stones, and dorjes, among other items, are never intelligent.) In general, less than 1% of psionic items have intelligence. </p></section><section id="h2-6-cursed-items"><h2>CURSED ITEMS</h2><p>Some psionic items are cursed—incorrectly made, or corrupted by outside forces. Cursed items might be particularly dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor f law, an inconvenient requirement, or an unpredictable nature. Randomly generated items are cursed 5% of the time.</p></section><section id="h2-7-charges-and-multiple-uses"><h2>CHARGES AND MULTIPLE USES</h2><p>Some items are limited in power by the number of charges they hold or the number of power points they contain. Normally, charged items (such as dorjes) have 50 charges at most. If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of charges left (round down, minimum 1).</p><p>Similarly, items that contain power points (such as psicrowns) have a number of points equal to 50 x the manifester level of the creator. If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number by which the manifester level is multiplied (round down, minimum 1).</p><p>Market prices given on the tables are always for fully charged or fully powered items. (When an item is created, it is fully charged or fully powered.) For an item that’s worthless when its charges or power points run out (which is the case for almost all charged or powered items), the value of the partially used item is proportional to the number of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to its charges, only part of the item’s value is based on the number of charges left.</p><p>Some items are single-use and expendable. Such items can often be found in sets or groups.</p></section><section id="h2-8-magic-items-for-psionic-characters"><h2>MAGIC ITEMS FOR PSIONIC CHARACTERS</h2><p>Many magic items can aid psionic characters. The table below provides some possibilities.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 59.3251em;"><caption>Table: Magic–Psionics Equivalencies</caption><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Magic Item</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Psionic Effect</td></tr><tr><td style="font-style: italic;">Helm of telepathy</td><td>Substitute power for spell</td></tr><tr><td style="font-style: italic;">Pearl of power</td><td>Treat in all ways as a <i>cognizance crystal</i> with power point capacity appropriate to the equivalent power level</td></tr><tr><td style="font-style: italic;">Crystal ball </td><td>Substitute power for spell </td></tr><tr><td style="font-style: italic;">Ioun stones</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Vibrant purple </td><td>Stores three levels of psionic powers</td></tr><tr><td>Pale lavender </td><td>Absorbs powers up to 4th level (burns out as normal)</td></tr><tr><td>Rainbow<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td><td>Provides 5 power points per day (regenerates)</td></tr><tr><td>Dull gray<sup style="font-weight: 700;">2</sup></td><td>Provides 1 power point to a psionic character, then disintegrates</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">1 New item: Treat as a <i>cognizance crystal</i> in <i>ioun stone</i> form, except that it regenerates its stored power points each day; Price 16,000 gp.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">2 Dull gray stones are useless for magic but still harbor just enough resonance that a psionic character can eke out 1 power point before the stone is gone forever.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section></section><section id="h1-9-psionic-item-descriptions"><h1>PSIONIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS</h1><p>In the following sections, each type of psionic item, such as armor or psionic tattoos, has a general description, followed by descriptions of specific items.</p><p>General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other information. The Armor Class, hardness, hit points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some types of psionic items. The Armor Class assumes that the item is unattended and includes a –5 penalty for the item’s effective Dexterity of 0. If a creature holds the item, use the creature’s Dexterity modifier as an adjustment to Armor Class in place of the –5 penalty.</p><p>Some individual items, notably those that simply store psionic powers, don’t get full-blown descriptions. Simply reference the power’s description. Assume that the power is manifested at the minimum level required to manifest it, unless otherwise noted. Increasing the manifester level so increases the cost of the item; see Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Value,substituting “spell” for “power” and “caster level” for “manifester level” as appropriate. The main reason to make the manifester level higher, or course, would be to increase the potency of the power. Raising the manifester level is common for powers such as <i>astral construct</i>, the duration of which increases with the level of the manifester.</p><p>Items with full descriptions have their abilities detailed, and each of the following aspects of these items is summarized at the end of the description.</p><p><strong>Aura:</strong> Most of the time, a <i>detect psionics</i> power will reveal the discipline associated with a psionic item and the strength of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable) is given at the beginning of the item’s notational entry in the form of a phrase. See the <i>detect psionics</i> power description for more information.</p><p><strong>Manifester Level:</strong> The next entry in the summary indicates the level of the creator (or the manifester level of the powers placed within the item, if this level is lower than the actual level of the creator). The manifester level provides the item’s saving throw bonus, as well as range and other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable).</p><p>It also determines the level that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a <i>dispel psionics</i> power or a similar situation. This information is given in the form “ML x,” where “ML” is an abbreviation for manifester</p><p>level and “x” is an ordinal number representing the manifester level itself.</p><p>For psionic tattoos, power stones, and dorjes, the creator can set the manifester level of an item at any number high enough to manifest the stored power and not higher than her own manifester level. For other psionic items, the item itself determines the manifester level. In this case, the creator’s manifester level must be as high as the item’s manifester level (and prerequisites may effectively put a higher minimum on the creator’s level).</p><p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Certain requirements must be met in order for a character to create a psionic item. These include feats, powers, and miscellaneous requirements such as level, alignment, and race or kind. The prerequisites for creation of an item are given in the summary immediately following the item’s manifester level.</p><p>A power prerequisite can be provided by a character who knows the power, or through the use of a power completion or power trigger psionic item or a psi-like ability that produces the desired power effect. For each day that passes during the creation process, the creator must expend one power completion item (such as a power stone) or 1 charge from a power trigger item (such as a dorje), if either of those objects is used to supply a prerequisite.</p><p>It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary, such as if one character knows some of the powers necessary to create an item and another character knows the rest.</p><p>If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the purpose of determinations where the creator’s level must be known. (It’s sensible, although not mandatory, for the highest-level character involved to be considered the creator.) The character designated as the creator pays the experience points required to make the item.</p><p>Typically, a list of prerequisites includes one feat and one or more powers (or some other requirement in addition to the feat). When two powers at the end of a list are separated by “or,” one of those powers is required in addition to every other power mentioned prior to the last two.</p><p><strong>Market Price:</strong> This gold piece value, given in the summary following the word “Price,” represents the price someone should expect to pay to buy the item. Market prices are also included on the random generation tables for easy reference. The market price of an item that can be constructed with a psionic item creation feat is usually equal to the base price + the price for any components (special materials or experience point expenditure).</p><p><strong>Cost to Create:</strong> The cost in gold pieces and experience points to create the item is given in the summary following the word “Cost.” This information appears only for items with components (material or experience points) that make their market prices higher than their base prices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the cost of the components. Items without components do not have a “Cost” entry. For them, the market price and base price are the same. The cost in gold pieces is 1/2 the market price, and the cost in experience points is 1/25 the market price. </p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> The notational entry for many items ends with a value for the item’s weight. When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for the purpose of determining how much of a load a character can carry).</p><section id="h2-10-random-psionic-items"><h2>RANDOM PSIONIC ITEMS</h2><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 33.3001em;"><caption>Table: Random Psionic Item Generation</caption><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Minor</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Medium</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Major</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Item</td></tr><tr><td>01–02</td><td>01–05</td><td>01–05</td><td>Armor, possibly with special ability</td></tr><tr><td>03–04</td><td>06–10</td><td>06–10</td><td>Shield, possibly with special ability</td></tr><tr><td>05–06</td><td>11–15</td><td>11–15</td><td>Melee weapon, possibly with special ability</td></tr><tr><td>08–09</td><td>16–20</td><td>16–20</td><td>Ranged weapon, possibly with special ability</td></tr><tr><td>10–40</td><td>21–40</td><td>21–35</td><td style="font-style: italic;">Cognizance crystal</td></tr><tr><td>41–46</td><td>41–50</td><td>36–45</td><td>Dorje</td></tr><tr><td>47–81</td><td>51–68</td><td>46–67</td><td>Power stone</td></tr><tr><td>82–87</td><td>69–82</td><td>68–75</td><td>Psicrown</td></tr><tr><td>88–93</td><td>83–89</td><td>76–87</td><td>Psionic tattoo</td></tr><tr><td>94–100</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>Minor universal item</td></tr><tr><td>—</td><td>90–100</td><td>—</td><td>Medium universal item</td></tr><tr><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>88–100</td><td>Major universal item</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h2-11-armor-and-shields"><h2>ARMOR AND SHIELDS</h2><p>In general, psionic armor and shields follow the rules for the equivalent magic items, as far as enhancement bonuses, stacking, and other base abilities are concerned.

Gleams and flashes from the armor give the wearer and his armor a “fuzzy” appearance, granting the wearer concealment.</p><p>Faint metacreativity; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>concealing amorpha;</i> Price +3 bonus.</p><p><strong>Heartening:</strong> This kind of shield grants the wearer up to 5 temporary hit points per day on command. These temporary hit points fade after 4 minutes. The wearer can activate this power as an immediate action at any time.</p><p>Faint psychometabolism; ML 4th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>vigor;</i> Price +720 gp.</p><p><strong>Landing:</strong> A suit of armor with this capability allows the wearer to ignore any damage dealt by the first 60 feet of a fall. Regardless of the height of a fall, the wearer always lands on her feet.</p><p>Faint psychoportation; ML 4th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>catfall;</i> Price +4,000 gp.</p><p><strong>Linked:</strong> This kind of armor or shield allows the wearer to form a telepathic bond with other wearers of linked armor or shields within 10 miles. This ability is otherwise similar to the <i>mindlink</i> power.</p><p>Moderate telepathy; ML 6th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>mindlink;</i> Price +6,000 gp.</p><p><strong>Manifester:</strong> This kind of shield generates 3 power points once per day that the wearer can use when manifesting a power he knows. These power points must all be used on the same power. As usual, a psionic character cannot pay a power’s cost with power points from more than one source, so the power points in the shield must be used for discrete manifestations.</p><p>Moderate clairsentience; ML 6th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, knowledge of any 2nd-level power; Price +10,800 gp.</p><p><strong>Mindarmor:</strong> This kind of armor or shield grants the wearer a +3 insight bonus on Will saving throws to resist all mind-affecting and/or compulsion powers.</p><p>Faint psychokinesis; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>empty mind;</i> Price +24,000 gp.</p><p><strong>Phasing:</strong> The wearer of this kind of armor can move through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The wearer can call on this special ability as a standard action. When the phasing ability is active, the wearer can pass through a wall or some other kind of appropriate object for a total distance of 60 feet per day (see below), breaking this distance up into several smaller passages or one long one, as desired. A wearer who exceeds this daily distance limit while inside solid material is ejected from the material at the point of entry, ending up prone in front of the now impassable barrier.</p><p>Phasing through a wall that separates two adjacent squares on the grid counts as 5 feet of distance. Phasing through a wall or barrier of any greater thickness counts as a distance equal to the barrier’s thickness plus 5 feet.</p><p>feet of distance.</p><p>Strong psychoportation; ML 13th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>psionic phase door;</i> Price +65,520 gp.</p><p><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> This kind of armor or shield grants the wearer power resistance while it is worn. The power resistance can be 13, 15, 17, or 19, depending on the amount that was built into the armor or shield.</p><p>Moderate clairsentience; ML 9th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>power resistance;</i> Price +2 bonus (PR 13); +3 bonus (PR 15); +4 bonus (PR 17); or +5 bonus (PR 19).</p><p><strong>Quickness:</strong> This kind of armor increases the wearer’s speed by 5 feet. Thus, a character whose normal speed in armor is 20 feet moves 25 feet in <i>armor of quickness.</i> </p><p>Faint psychoportation; ML 4th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>burst;</i> Price +1 bonus.</p><p><strong>Radiant:</strong> The wearer of this kind of armor gains resistance 10 against energy attacks (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). The armor absorbs the first 10 points of damage dealt by any such attack, and this absorption causes it to radiate light for a number of rounds equal to the points of damage absorbed. This light is sufficient to illuminate a 60-foot-radius area.</p><p>If the armor absorbs more damage while it is radiating light, the newer radiant effect overlaps (does not stack with) the effect that was already in place. </p><p>Moderate psychokinesis; ML 9th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor; <i>energy adaptation;</i> Price +4 bonus.</p><p><strong>Ranged:</strong> The wielder of a ranged shield can throw it in combat, with a range increment of 30 feet. While in the air, the shield is treated in all ways as a ranged weapon and cannot be blocked or grabbed except by those with appropriate feats. No matter the size of the wielder, a buckler or light shield deals 1d6 points of damage and a heavy one 1d8 points. (A tower shield cannot be created with this special ability.) The wielder’s Strength modifier and the shield’s enhancement bonus add to the base damage.</p><p>A ranged shield flies through the air back to the creature that threw it. It returns to the wielder just before the creature’s next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn).</p><p>Catching a ranged shield when it comes back is a free action. If the wielder can’t catch it, or if the wielder has moved since throwing it, the shield drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.</p><p>Faint psychokinesis; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>far hand;</i> Price +1 bonus.</p><p><strong>Seeing:</strong> This kind of armor grants a wider than normal field of vision, so that opponents flanking the wearer gain only a +1 bonus on their attack rolls instead of +2 (rogues still get their full sneak attack damage because the wearer is still flanked). The wearer gains a +1 enhancement bonus on Spot checks but takes a –2 penalty on saves against gaze attacks.</p><p>Faint clairsentience; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>ubiquitous vision;</i> Price +6,000 gp.</p><p><strong>Time Buttress:</strong> This kind of shield gives the wielder a chance to avoid telling blows by using time itself as a shield. Once per day, the wielder can use <i>timeless body</i> as though manifesting the power.</p><p>Strong psychoportation; ML 17th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>timeless body;</i> Price +5 bonus.</p><p><strong>Vanishing:</strong> On command, this suit of armor or shield renders its wearer and all the wearer’s equipment invisible to the minds of others, as if he had manifested the power <i>cloud mind</i>. The wearer can use this ability twice per day.</p><p>Faint psychokinesis; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>cloud mind;</i> Price +3 bonus.</p><p><strong>Wall:</strong> As a standard action once per day, the wielder can drop this kind of shield at his feet and command a <i>wall of ectoplasm</i> (as the power) to come into being, with the shield as the point of origin for the effect. This effect forms a wall whose area is up to twelve 10-foot squares or a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 12 feet. The wall dissipates after 7 minutes, or sooner if the wielder of the shield reclaims it (thus dismissing the effect).</p><p>Strong metacreativity; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>wall of ectoplasm</i>; Price +20,160 gp.</p></section></section><section id="h2-13-weapons"><h2>WEAPONS</h2><p>Although they generally follow the rules for magic weapons, psionic weapons differ from mundane and magic weapons in their design. Most possess some crystal components, and some are composed entirely of crystal. Many also sport intricate traceries along the blade or haft, which flicker now and then as if channeling flows of psychic energy.</p><p>Psionic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses on both attack and damage rolls when used in combat. This enhancement bonus is effective for the purpose of overcoming creatures with damage resistance that is penetrated by magic. All psionic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonus on attack rolls does not stack with their enhancement bonus on attack rolls.</p><p>Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonus applies to either type of attack. </p><p>In addition to enhancement bonuses, psionic weapons can also have the special abilities detailed here. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p><p>The rules for manifester level for weapons (called caster level), additional damage dice, ranged weapons and ammunition, ammunition and breakage, hardness and hit points, critical hits, and weapons for unusually sized creatures for psionic weapons are the same as for magic weapons. Psionic weapons do not have the chance to generate light (though some may be mentally audible; see below).</p><p><strong>Mentally Audible:</strong> Fully 30% of psionic weapons telepathically mutter, croon, recite battle poems, scream, or produce other mental “noises” when first drawn, at first blood, or when they slay a significant enemy. Such a weapon cannot be concealed from creatures within 15 feet when it is drawn, nor can its mental “soundtrack” be curbed.</p><p><strong>Activation:</strong> Usually a character benefits from a psionic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon—by attacking with it. If a weapon has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to project a command thought (a standard action).</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 45.1501em;"><caption>Table: Psionic Melee Weapon Special Abilities</caption><tbody><tr><td style="width: 6.225em; font-weight: 700;">Minor</td><td style="width: 6.075em; font-weight: 700;">Medium</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Major</td><td style="width: 9.45em; font-weight: 700;">Special Ability</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Base Price Modifier</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">01–15</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">01–10</td><td>—</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Psychokinetic</td><td>+1 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">16–45</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">11–25</td><td>01–09</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Dissipater</td><td>+1 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">46–55</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">26–30</td><td>10–12</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Lucky</td><td>+1 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">56–70</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">31–40</td><td>13–17</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Sundering</td><td>+1 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">71–80</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">41–46</td><td>18–21</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Power storing</td><td>+1 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">81–99</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">51–56</td><td>22–30</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Collision</td><td>+2 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">—</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">57–65</td><td>31–37</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Mindcrusher</td><td>+2 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">—</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">66–71</td><td>38–41</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Psychokinetic burst</td><td>+2 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">—</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">72–75</td><td>42–49</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Suppression</td><td>+2 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">—</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">76–78</td><td>50–58</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Psibane</td><td>+2 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">—</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">79–81</td><td>59–61</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Parrying</td><td>+8,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">—</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">82–85</td><td>62–65</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Manifester</td><td>+16,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">—</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">86–88</td><td>66–71</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Bodyfeeder</td><td>+3 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">—</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">89–91</td><td>72–77</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Mindfeeder</td><td>+3 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">—</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">92–93</td><td>78–83</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Soulbreaker</td><td>+3 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">—</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">94</td><td>84–86</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Psychic</td><td>+35,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">—</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">95</td><td>87–90</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Coup de grace</td><td>+5 bonus<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6.225em;">100</td><td style="width: 6.075em;">96–100</td><td>91–100</td><td style="width: 9.45em;">Roll again twice<sup style="font-weight: 700;">2</sup></td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" style="width: 37.5751em;">1 Add to enhancement bonus to determine total market price.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" style="width: 37.5751em;">2 Reroll if you get a duplicate special ability, an ability incompatible with an ability that you’ve already rolled, or if the extra ability puts you over the +10 limit.

They can also have the special abilities detailed here. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p><p><strong>Bodyfeeder:</strong> All feeder weapons have a special ability that functions only upon scoring a successful critical hit. A bodyfeeder weapon grants its wielder temporary hit points equal to the total damage dealt by a successful critical hit. These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes. Thus, if the wielder of a bodyfeeder weapon successfully scores a critical hit while the wielder still enjoys temporary hit points from a previous critical hit, the wielder gains only the better of the two values: either his current number of temporary hit points, or the new influx of temporary hit points, whichever is higher.</p><p>Strong psychometabolism; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>claws of the vampire;</i> Price +3 bonus.</p><p><strong>Collision:</strong> Collision weapons psionically increase their own mass at the end point of each swing or shot. Such weapons deal an extra 5 points of damage on each successful strike, in addition to the weapon’s enhancement bonus. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow the extra damage upon their ammunition.</p><p>Moderate metacreativity; ML 10th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>matter manipulation;</i> Price +2 bonus.</p><p><strong>Coup de Grace:</strong> Coup de grace weapons are exceptionally dangerous. On a successful critical hit, the foe must succeed on a DC 27 Will save or be paralyzed for 1 round. While this ability does work on creatures that are immune to extra damage from critical hits, it does not work on creatures without an Intelligence score. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this ability on their ammunition.</p><p>Strong telepathy; ML 19th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>psionic dominate;</i> Price +5 bonus.</p><p><strong>Dislocator:</strong> The wielder of this kind of weapon can attempt to dislocate a designated foe up to three times per day. On a successful hit, the foe must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be teleported 1–100 miles in a random direction. If the weapon misses, the use is wasted. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this ability on their ammunition.</p><p>Strong psychoportation; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>psionic teleport;</i> Price +3 bonus.</p><p><strong>Dissipater:</strong> This kind of weapon is devastating to creatures and objects composed of or originally formed from ectoplasm (such as astral constructs, walls of ectoplasm, creatures in ectoplasmic form, and items created using the metacreativity discipline). Against qualifying targets, a dissipater weapon ignores damage reduction and hardness, and treats all successful hits as critical hits. </p><p>Strong metacreativity; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>dismiss ectoplasm;</i> Price +1 bonus.</p><p><strong>Great Dislocator:</strong> The wielder of this kind of weapon can attempt to greatly dislocate a designated foe up to three times per day. On a successful hit, the foe must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or be cast into a random alternate plane of existence. If the weapon misses, the use is wasted. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this ability upon their ammunition.</p><p>Strong psychoportation; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>psionic plane shift</i>; Price +4 bonus.</p><p><strong>Lucky:</strong> A lucky weapon offers a second chance at success. Once per day, the wielder can reroll a failed attack roll (whether a single attack or one in a series of multiple attacks) as a free action. The rerolled attack uses the same bonuses or penalties as the missed roll.</p><p>Moderate clairsentience; ML 8th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>fate of one;</i> Price +1 bonus.</p><p><strong>Manifester:</strong> This kind of weapon generates 5 power points once per day that the wearer can use when manifesting a power he knows. These power points must all be used on the same power. As usual, a psionic character cannot pay a power’s cost with power points from more than one source, so the power points in the shield must be used for discrete manifestations.</p><p>Moderate clairsentience; ML 8th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, knowledge of any 3rd-level power; Price +16,000 gp.</p><p><strong>Mindcrusher:</strong> Any psionic creature struck in combat by a mindcrusher weapon loses a number of power points equal to half the amount of hit point damage the weapon deals (only the base damage of the weapon contributes to the power point loss; additional damage from high Strength or other sources does not cause additional power point loss). A psionic creature that is out of power points (or has none) must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or take 1d2 points of Wisdom damage.</p><p>Strong psychometabolism; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>psychic vampire;</i> Price +2 bonus.</p><p><strong>Mindfeeder:</strong> All feeder weapons have a special ability that functions only upon scoring a successful critical hit. A mindfeeder weapon grants its wielder temporary power points equal to the total damage dealt by a successful critical hit. These temporary power points last for 10 minutes. The wielder gains power points even if the target has none (effectively, its hit point damage is converted to power points). Constructs and undead are not subject to mindfeeder weapons. As with temporary hit points, temporary power points do not stack with each other; they overlap. Thus, if a mindfeeder weapon successfully scores a critical hit while the wielder still enjoys temporary power points from a previous critical hit, the wielder gains only the better of the two values: either her current number of temporary power points, or the new influx of temporary power points, whichever is higher.</p><p>Strong psychometabolism; ML 15th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>psychic vampire;</i> Price +3 bonus.</p><p><strong>Parrying:</strong> A parrying weapon perceives an instant into the future, and of its own accord resists melee and ranged attacks aimed at the wielder, granting a +1 insight bonus to the wielder’s Armor Class. The weapon is so adept at parrying that it even affects incoming powers, granting the wielder a +1 insight bonus on saving throws. The bonuses are granted whenever the wielder holds the weapon, even if flat-footed.</p><p>Faint clairsentience; ML 5th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>defensive precognition;</i> Price +8,000 gp.</p><p><strong>Power Storing:</strong> A power storing weapon allows a manifester to store a single targeted power of up to 5 power points in the weapon. (The power must have a manifesting time of 1 standard action.) Any time the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately manifest the power on that creature as a swift action if the wielder desires. (This ability is an exception to the rule that manifesting a power from an item takes at least as long as manifesting that power normally.) Once the power is manifested, the weapon is empty, and a manifester can imbed any other targeted power of up to 5 power points into it. The weapon telepathically whispers to the wearer the name of the power currently stored within it. A randomly generated power storing weapon has a 50% chance to have a power stored in it already.</p><p>Strong psychokinesis; ML 12th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, creator must be a manifester of at least 12th level; Price +1 bonus.</p><p><strong>Psibane:</strong> A psibane weapon is crafted to oppose psionic beings. When used against such creatures, its effective enhancement bonus is 2 higher than its actual enhancement bonus. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against psionic opponents. It bestows one negative level on any psionic creature attempting to wield it. This negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way while the weapon is wielded. Psibane bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this ability upon their ammunition.</p><p>Strong clairsentience; ML 15th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>bend reality;</i> Price +2 bonus.</p><p><strong>Psychic:</strong> A psychic weapon’s power depends on its wielder. In the hands of a nonpsionic creature, the weapon possesses the qualities of a nonmagical, nonpsionic masterwork weapon. When wielded by a psionic creature, this weapon has an enhancement bonus based on the wielder’s current power point reserve, as shown on the following table. The weapon’s enhancement bonus decreases as the wielder spends power points, and it increases whenever the wielder gains enough power points (by any means) to put his power point reserve into the next higher category.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 21.2251em;" data-no-caption="1"><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Power Point Reserve</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Enhancement Bonus</td></tr><tr><td>1–4 </td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>5–29 </td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>30–79 </td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>80–129 </td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>130 or higher </td><td>+5</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Strong clairsentience; ML 17th; Craft Psionic Arms and Armor, <i>reality revision;</i> Price +35,000.</p><p><strong>Psychokinetic:</strong> Upon command, a psychokinetic weapon glows from the inside with lethal psionic energy. The energy does not harm the hands that hold the weapon. Such a weapon deals an extra 1d4 points of damage on a successful hit.

If the weapon’s critical multiplier is x3, add 2d6 points of extra damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add 3d6 points of extra damage.

Each dorje has 50 charges when created, and each charge expended allows one use of that power. A dorje that runs out of charges is just a simple crystal.</p><p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> A typical dorje is an elongated crystal of one color (or colorless), between 8 inches and 10 inches long and about 1/2 inch thick, which can weigh up to 1/4 pound. Occasionally, a dorje is decorated with carvings or inscribed runes along a face of the crystal. A typical dorje has AC 7, 7 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 18.</p><p><strong>Activation:</strong> Dorjes use the power trigger activation method, so manifesting a power from a dorje is usually a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the power being manifested has a manifesting time longer than 1 standard action, however, it takes that long to manifest the power from a dorje.) The user must have the power on his class list, even if he knows the command thought. Additionally, to activate a dorje, a character must hold it in hand and point it in the general direction of the target or area to be affected.</p><p>Dorjes are normally created at the minimum manifester level required to manifest the power, and powers that can be augmented are not augmented when stored in a dorje. A dorje’s wielder cannot augment the power contained within the dorje. However, dorjes can be created at a higher manifester level than required to manifest the power. In this case, the dorje that holds an augmentable power is augmented, to the limit of the manifester level and the power’s augmentation maximums, if any. The manifester level of a dorje cannot be more than five higher than the minimum manifester level to use the power it contains.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 36.9751em;"><caption>Table: Dorjes</caption><tbody><tr><td style="width: 5.475em; font-weight: 700;">Minor</td><td style="width: 5.625em; font-weight: 700;">Medium</td><td style="width: 4.725em; font-weight: 700;">Major</td><td style="width: 7.2em; font-weight: 700;">Power Level<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td><td style="width: 7.65em; font-weight: 700;">Market Price<sup style="font-weight: 700;">2</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 5.475em;">01–50</td><td style="width: 5.625em;">—</td><td style="width: 4.725em;">—</td><td style="width: 7.2em;">1st</td><td style="width: 7.65em;">750 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 5.475em;">51–95</td><td style="width: 5.625em;">01–05</td><td style="width: 4.725em;">—</td><td style="width: 7.2em;">2nd</td><td style="width: 7.65em;">4,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 5.475em;">96–100</td><td style="width: 5.625em;">06–65</td><td style="width: 4.725em;">—</td><td style="width: 7.2em;">3rd</td><td style="width: 7.65em;">11,250 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 5.475em;">—</td><td style="width: 5.625em;">66–95</td><td style="width: 4.725em;">01–05</td><td style="width: 7.2em;">4th</td><td style="width: 7.65em;">21,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 5.475em;">—</td><td style="width: 5.625em;">96–100</td><td style="width: 4.725em;">06–50</td><td style="width: 7.2em;">5th</td><td style="width: 7.65em;">33,750 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 5.475em;">—</td><td style="width: 5.625em;">—</td><td style="width: 4.725em;">51–70</td><td style="width: 7.2em;">6th</td><td style="width: 7.65em;">49,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 5.475em;">—</td><td style="width: 5.625em;">—</td><td style="width: 4.725em;">71–85</td><td style="width: 7.2em;">7th</td><td style="width: 7.65em;">68,250 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 5.475em;">—</td><td style="width: 5.625em;">—</td><td style="width: 4.725em;">86–95</td><td style="width: 7.2em;">8th</td><td style="width: 7.65em;">90,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 5.475em;">—</td><td style="width: 5.625em;">—</td><td style="width: 4.725em;">95–100</td><td style="width: 7.2em;">9th</td><td style="width: 7.65em;">114,750 gp</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" style="width: 30.6751em;">1 Some dorjes have higher manifester levels than the minimum power level, which give them commensurately higher costs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" style="width: 30.6751em;">2 Any dorje that stores a power with an experience point cost also has an XP cost in addition to that noted here.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h2-17-power-stones"><h2>POWER STONES</h2><p>A power stone stores a power (or collection of powers). A stored power can be used only once, “flushing” the stone. Using a power stone is basically like manifesting a power.</p><p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> A power stone is a thumb-sized chunk of crystal that possesses a barely detectable interior glow if it holds a low-level power. A stone imprinted with more than one power or a higher-level power glows more brightly, but never enough to provide illumination in its own right. A typical power stone has AC 7, 5 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 20.</p><p><strong>Activation:</strong> To activate a power stone, a manifester must mentally address it, as described below. Once the power is known, the power stone is treated as a power completion item, except as noted below.</p><p><em>Addressing the Stone:</em> A power stone must be “addressed” before a character can use it or know exactly what power it contains. Doing this requires a successful Psicraft check (DC 15 + power level). Once a particular power stone has been addressed, it is not necessary to do so again. Addressing a power stone in advance lets a character proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use it.</p><p>Using a stone’s stored power after addressing the stone requires holding the stone and willing the power’s manifestation, as if manifesting a power normally (a standard action). Activating a power stone is subject to disruption just as manifesting a power normally would be.</p><p>Additionally, the user must meet the following requirements.</p><p>• The user must have the power on his or her class list.</p><p>• The user must have the requisite key ability score.</p><p>If the user meets these requirements and has a manifester level at least equal to the power’s manifester level, she can automatically manifest the stored power without a check. If she meets both requirements but her own level is lower than the power stone’s manifester level, she has to make a manifester level check (1d20 + user’s level), against a DC equal to the power stone’s manifester level +1, to manifest the power successfully. On a failure, the user must succeed on a DC 5 Wisdom check to avoid brainburn (see below). A natural roll of 1 on this check is always a failure.</p><p><em>Determine Effect:</em> A power successfully manifested from a power stone works exactly as if manifested normally. Assume the power stone’s manifester level is always the minimum level required to manifest the power for the character who imprinted the stone, unless the creator specifically desires otherwise.</p><p>A power stone’s glow fades when its stored power is flushed.</p><p><em>Brainburn:</em> When something goes awry, the user of a power stone improperly manifests the stored power. The resultant psionic surge persists for 1d4 rounds, unless the power stone is flung farther than 100 feet away or is destroyed. This surge deals 1d6 points of damage per power stored per round and arcs across multiple targets, similar to <i>energy current</i>, except the damage type isn’t specified. The user is the primary target, and one nearby ally is the secondary target (chosen at random).</p><p>The manifester level for a standard power stone is the minimum manifester level needed to manifest the power (unless otherwise specified).</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 13.2em;"><caption>Table: Power Stone Types</caption><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">d%</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Type</td></tr><tr><td>01–70</td><td>Psion/wilder</td></tr><tr><td>71–100</td><td>Psychic warrior</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 21.7501em;"><caption>Table: Powers Imprinted in a Power Stone</caption><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Power Stone Type</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Number of Powers</td></tr><tr><td>Minor</td><td>1d3 powers</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>1d4 powers</td></tr><tr><td>Major</td><td>1d6 powers</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 41.1001em;"><caption>Table: Power Stone Levels</caption><tbody><tr><td style="width: 6em; font-weight: 700;">Minor</td><td style="width: 5.175em; font-weight: 700;">Medium</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Major</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Power Level</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Market Price<sup style="font-weight: 700;">1</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6em;">01–50</td><td style="width: 5.175em;">—</td><td>—</td><td>1st</td><td>25 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6em;">51–95</td><td style="width: 5.175em;">01–05</td><td>—</td><td>2nd</td><td>150 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6em;">96–100</td><td style="width: 5.175em;">06–65</td><td>—</td><td>3rd</td><td>375 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6em;">—</td><td style="width: 5.175em;">66–95</td><td>01–05</td><td>4th</td><td>700 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6em;">—</td><td style="width: 5.175em;">96–100</td><td>06–50</td><td>5th</td><td>1,125 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6em;">—</td><td style="width: 5.175em;">—</td><td>51–70</td><td>6th</td><td>1,650 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6em;">—</td><td style="width: 5.175em;">—</td><td>71–85</td><td>7th<sup style="font-weight: 700;">2</sup></td><td>2,275 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6em;">—</td><td style="width: 5.175em;">—</td><td>86–95</td><td>8th<sup style="font-weight: 700;">2</sup></td><td>3,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 6em;">—</td><td style="width: 5.175em;">—</td><td>95–100</td><td>9th<sup style="font-weight: 700;">2</sup></td><td>3,825 gp</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" style="width: 34.2001em;">1 Any power stone that has an imprinted power with an experience point cost also has an XP cost in addition to that noted here.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" style="width: 34.2001em;">2 Reroll if a level of 7th or higher is indicated for a psychic warrior power stone.

Unlike dorjes, which can contain a wide variety of powers, each psicrown is of a certain kind and holds specific powers. Unless otherwise stated, a psicrown has power points equal to 50 x its manifester level when created. These power points can be spent only on the powers that are contained in the psicrown.</p><p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> A typical psicrown is large enough to fit on the head of a Medium creature. Some psicrowns are actually crownlike and heavily adorned, while others are simple headbands with crystal centerpieces. All psicrowns weigh less than 1 pound. Most psicrowns are metallic, but one could potentially be composed of any material. Metallic psicrowns have AC 10, 10 hit points, hardness 8, and a break DC of 28. Psicrowns made of psionically reinforced silk have AC 7, 10 hit points, hardness 2, and a break DC of 24. Psicrowns can be made from other, more exotic materials, but all have at least the strength and durability of psicrowns made of psionically reinforced silk.</p><p><strong>Activation:</strong> Psicrowns use the power trigger activation method, so manifesting a power from a psicrown is usually a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the power being manifested, however, has a longer manifesting time than 1 standard action, it takes that long to manifest the power from a psicrown.) When activating a psicrown, the user spends power points contained in the psicrown on any one of the psicrown’s powers. Powers activated from a psicrown can be augmented with additional power points from the psicrown itself, so long as the total number of power points spent does not exceed the user’s manifester level.

The wearer doesn’t get to make any decisions about the tattoo’s effect—the manifester who scribed it has already done so.</p><p>Psionic tattoos can vary in size, but a creature can wear only a total of twenty tattoos at one time—attempting to add one more than this maximum causes all previously scribed tattoos to simultaneously activate. A psionic tattoo fades away after use.</p><p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> A typical psionic tattoo is a colorful pattern of tiny, interlacing lines within a larger design. This design can be as simple as a circle or a star, or as complex as an artist wishes to make it. Once it is scribed, a tattoo’s design does not change. A psionic tattoo usually covers an area of skin no more than 5 inches in diameter (larger ones could be designed, but would have no added effect).</p><p><strong>Scribing and Transferring Tattoos:</strong> The manifester level of a psionic tattoo is the minimum level required to manifest the scribed power. A psionic tattoo can contain only powers of 3rd level or lower.</p><p>A psionic tattoo inscribed on a wearer is potentially more mobile than a mundane tattoo. As a standard action, the wearer can will the tattoo to move to a different part of his body or onto the skin of any willing (or unconscious) living creature he touches. If the wearer of a psionic tattoo is rendered unconscious or is slain, another sentient creature can touch the tattoo while willing it to leave the previous wearer and apply itself to the new creature as a standard action. Psionic tattoos cannot overlay one another.</p><p><strong>Identifying Psionic Tattoos:</strong> In addition to the standard methods of identification, the wearer of a tattoo can concentrate on it and attempt to gain some sense of how it would feel if activated. A successful DC 13 Intelligence check provides a hint to the tattoo’s effect. </p><p><strong>Activation:</strong> A psionic tattoo produces its effect when touched by its wearer and willed to do so. This activity, called “tapping” the tattoo, is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A psionic tattoo fades away after use.</p><p>The following rules govern the use of psionic tattoos.</p><p>• A creature must have an appropriate physical surface on which to scribe the pattern (thus, incorporeal creatures or creatures with impermanent flesh, such as fire elementals, cannot use psionic tattoos).</p><p>• Tapping a psionic tattoo provokes attacks of opportunity. A successful attack (including grappling attacks) against the wearer forces a Concentration check. A wearer who fails this check cannot concentrate effectively on the tattoo to use it. The tattoo remains untapped, and the wearer can make another attempt.</p><p>• A character can trigger the effects of another’s psionic tattoo if the other wearer is unconscious. It is a full-round action to find, touch, and concentrate on an unconscious creature’s tattoo in order to tap it. </p><p>The manifester level for a standard psionic tattoo is the minimum manifester level needed to manifest the power (unless otherwise specified).</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 24.8251em;"><caption>Table: Psionic Tattoos</caption><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Minor</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Medium</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Major</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Power Level</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Market Price</td></tr><tr><td>01–47</td><td>01–08</td><td>—</td><td>1st</td><td>50 gp</td></tr><tr><td>47–100</td><td>09–75</td><td>01–50</td><td>2nd</td><td>300 gp</td></tr><tr><td>—</td><td>76–100</td><td>51–100</td><td>3rd</td><td>750 gp</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><section id="h2-21-universal-items"><h2>UNIVERSAL ITEMS</h2><p>This is a catchall category for any psionic item that doesn’t fall into the other groups.

Once per day, the wearer can mentally command the <i>catapsi</i> power, which blankets a 30- foot-radius area surrounding the wearer in telepathic noise for 9 rounds. Each time other psionic characters within this range attempt to manifest a power, they must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or pay 4 more points than they otherwise would for each power manifestation.

The wearer can use this power once per day.</p><p>Strong psychoportation; ML 15th; Craft Universal Item, <i>temporal acceleration;</i> Price 43,200 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p><p><strong>Crawling Tattoos:</strong> Crawling tattoos resemble standard psionic tattoos, but their effects are often harmful rather than beneficial. Like a psionic tattoo, a crawling tattoo can be scribed only with a power of no higher than 3rd level that targets one or more creatures. Exceptions are the <i>body adjustment</i> power, which can be scribed even though it affects only the manifester, and telepathy (compulsion) powers, which cannot be scribed at all. Powers that normally have an area affect only one target if scribed in a crawling tattoo. Powers with an experience point requirement cannot be scribed into a crawling tattoo. Otherwise, crawling tattoos are treated as psionic tattoos until they are activated by the wearer.</p><p>The wearer of a crawling tattoo can tap the tattoo as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, mentally specifying a target (to which the wearer must have line of sight). Instead of manifesting its stored power, the tattoo animates, drops to the ground, and scuttles toward the target. The original wearer need no longer concentrate on the tattoo once animated.</p><p>The animated tattoo moves toward its designated target in the same round when it is activated. Treat it as a Fine construct that has AC 18, 10 hit points, a hardness of 5, speed 30 feet, and a bonus on attack rolls equal to the wearer’s manifester level + his key ability modifier. Crawling tattoos, unlike true constructs, are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and similar effects. Should the target be killed, teleport away, or otherwise absent itself before the animated tattoo reaches it, the wearer can reclaim the tattoo. If it is destroyed, a crawling tattoo shatters and evaporates.</p><p>A crawling tattoo must enter the target’s square to attack and thus provokes attacks of opportunity as it passes through the target’s threatened area. The tattoo makes one touch attack per round thereafter until it strikes its target or is destroyed. On a successful attack, the power scribed in the crawling tattoo affects the target if the target fails the appropriate saving throw; however, powers that normally allow a Reflex saving throw automatically affect the touched target. Crawling tattoos can ferry beneficial powers as well as harmful ones, and a target can allow the tattoo’s touch attack to succeed if he or she desires.</p><p>Two examples of crawling tattoos are described below; many more types are possible.</p><p><em>Market Price:</em> The cost of a crawling tattoo depends on the level of the power scribed in it.</p><div class="table-container"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; min-width: 13.275em;" data-no-caption="1"><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: 700;">Power Level</td><td style="font-weight: 700;">Market Price</td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>50 gp</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>300 gp</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>750 gp</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><i>Crawling Tattoo of Concussion</i>: This crawling tattoo delivers a concussion effect, dealing 1d6 points of damage to a creature hit by its touch attack.</p><p>Faint psychokinesis; ML 1st; Craft Universal Item, <i>concussion blast;</i> Price 50 gp.</p><p><i>Crawling Tattoo of Energy Bolt</i>: Each of these tattoos is keyed to one energy type: cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.

It ensnares the minds of those within range who manifest powers of a specified psionic discipline. The triggering discipline is specified at the time of creation.</p><p>A <i>crystal anchor</i> is activated by plunging the sharp head into the ground, leaving the shaft freestanding. It projects an invisible, 30-foot-radius field. If a power from the speci- fied discipline is manifested within this range, the manifester must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + power level) or become subject to an effect similar to <i>brain lock</i>, except that the effect is permanent until dispelled or dismissed by the individual who initially drove the <i>crystal anchor</i> into the earth. Any anchor can be pulled out of the ground and reused at a later time.</p><p>When a <i>crystal anchor</i> successfully ensnares a target, a slender filament of insubstantial ectoplasm connects the victim to the shaft, even one outside the original area of the field.</p><p>A <i>crystal anchor</i> can attempt to ensnare a victim only five times per day. Previously caught targets can remain caught day after day and do not count against this daily limit on attempts.</p><p>An anchor’s owner can designate certain creatures to be unaffected by the anchor; such creatures need not make a saving throw and do not count against the daily limit on attempts. One <i>crystal anchor</i> can ensnare multiple targets simultaneously, and multiple <i>crystal anchors</i> can share overlapping fields.</p><p>Anchors that activate when a specific power is manifested in range are also possible, but are rarer.</p><p>A <i>crystal anchor</i> has AC 7, 15 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 20.</p><p><em>Body Crystal Anchor:</em> Those who manifest psychometabolism powers are affected as described above.</p><p>Faint psychometabolism; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, <i>brain lock, psionic contingency</i>, any psychometabolism power; Price 24,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.</p><p><em>Comprehension Crystal Anchor:</em> Those who manifest clairsentience powers are affected as described above.</p><p>Faint clairsentience; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, <i>brain lock, psionic contingency</i>, any clairsentience power; Price 24,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.</p><p><em>Creation Crystal Anchor:</em> Those who manifest metacreativity powers are affected as described above.</p><p>Faint metacreativity; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, <i>brain lock, psionic contingency</i>, any metacreativity power; Price 24,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.</p><p><em>Energy Crystal Anchor:</em> Those who manifest psychokinesis powers are affected as described above.</p><p>Faint psychokinesis; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, <i>brain lock, psionic contingency</i>, any psychokinesis power; Price 24,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.</p><p><em>Ghost Crystal Anchor:</em> Those who manifest <i>remote viewing</i> are affected as described above.</p><p>Faint clairsentience; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, <i>brain lock, psionic contingency</i>, <i>remote viewing;</i> Price 24,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.</p><p><em>Mind Crystal Anchor:</em> Those who manifest telepathy powers are affected as described above.</p><p>Faint telepathy; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, <i>brain lock, psionic contingency</i>, any telepathy power; Price 24,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.</p><p><em>Travel Crystal Anchor:</em> Those who manifest psychoportation powers are affected as described above.</p><p>Faint psychoportation; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, <i>brain lock, psionic contingency</i>, any psychoportation power; Price 24,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.</p><p><strong>Crystal Masks:</strong> Each of the various types of crystal masks fits over the face of any Medium or Small humanoid, with slits for eyes and nostrils.

They are difficult to find and dangerous to handle, but once found, are often even more difficult to destroy. A major psionic artifact has only a single, specific means of destruction.</p><p><strong>Annulus:</strong> This artifact is the ultimate psionic nullifier. Forged to keep enemies of vast psionic power at bay, the <i>Annulus</i> is an artifact that any psionic being should fear. It has been forgotten in the modern age, and merely finding it would precipitate a great upheaval across the planes.</p><p>The <i>Annulus</i> is a 1-foot-diameter ring of silvery material. Tiny slots, antennae, spheres, and other intricate projections decorate the exterior of the hoop; however, two smoothed lengths of the ring provide an adequate surface for grasping the item.</p><p>The <i>Annulus</i> has several powers, all of which require a wielder to tightly grasp the ring with at least one hand. When it is first grasped, knowledge of the artifact’s powers immediately flood the wielder’s mind. The wielder can access all powers of the <i>Annulus</i> at manifester level 20th.</p><p>• The <i>Annulus</i> generates a continuous <i>catapsi</i> effect within a 100-foot-radius of the wielder (who is unaffected).</p><p>• The wielder gains a +4 enhancement bonus on any attempt to resist an effect that deals ability damage.</p><p>• Once per day, the wielder can trigger <i>ultrablast</i> as a standard action.</p><p>• Three times per day, as a standard action, the wielder can trigger an effect similar to <i>psionic dimensional anchor</i> that affects all creatures in a 50-foot radius.</p><p>The primary power of the <i>Annulus,</i> however, is psionic nullification. Once per year, the wielder can trigger this effect as a special action requiring 10 rounds of continuous concentration to complete. The wielder specifies a target or targets within a 100-foot radius, ranging from a specific psionic individual or item to a group of psionic beings that share the same philosophy. The nullification effect is accompanied by blasts of light, heat, and sound from the <i>Annulus.</i> Nonpsionic creatures and items are unaffected, as are nontargeted beings, but any psionic target—regardless of any protection it may possess—disintegrates in a terrific explosion. Nothing is left but floating dust.</p><p>It is relatively easy to nullify a single target or a small group of targets, but nullifying a more powerful being (such as a demigod or greater entity) or another major artifact taxes the <i>Annulus</i> to its limits. If it is used to nullify such a target, the artifact succeeds but is destroyed in the process and cannot be retrieved by any means.</p><p><strong>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind:</strong> An elaborate crystalline psicrown etched with strange designs, this exceptional psicrown is so invested with power that it is considered an artifact. </p><p>The power points in the <i>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind</i> can be used to manifest any of the following powers at manifester level 20th (or at the wearer’s manifester level if it is higher than 20th).</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Burst</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Catfall</p><p>• <i>Concealing amorpha, greater</i></p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Concussion blast</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Daze, psionic</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Detect psionics</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Dominate, psionic</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Far hand</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Float</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Mindlink</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Inertial barrier</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Telekinetic force</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Telekinetic maneuver</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Telekinetic thrust</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Teleport, psionic</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• Thicken skin</p><p style="font-style: italic;">• True metabolism</p><p>The wearer of the <i>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind</i> also gains power resistance equal to 10 + his manifester level.</p><p>The <i>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind</i> has 1,000 power points when discovered. Anyone who dons the crown instantly knows the number of power points it has at the current time. The crown recharges itself, gaining back 1 power point per day if it currently has fewer than 1,000 points.</p><p>As a special one-time use of the psicrown, the wearer can channel all the remaining charges in the psicrown into an uncontrolled burst of energy. The wearer triggers this use as a standard action. All within 20 feet of the wearer take hit points of damage equal to half the power points left in the staff (Reflex DC 18 half). The wearer inhabits a tiny eye of calm at the center of the destruction and is unharmed, but the psicrown is reduced to a burned-out cinder.</p></section></section></section><section id="h1-28-creating-psionic-items"><h1>CREATING PSIONIC ITEMS</h1><p>To calculate the costs involved in creating a psionic item, refer to Creating Magic Items.

Psicrowns are always created with full power points.</p><p>Alternatively, if you want to have a higher manifester level in the psicrown, you must pay for the psicrown as if the highest-level power is one level higher for each additional two manifester levels you want.</p><p>The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in the psicrown (or must have the power available in some other form). If any of the powers has an XP cost, the creator must provide XP equal to 50 x that cost. This expense is in addition to the experience point cost for making the psicrown itself. The act of working on a psicrown costs a number of power points per day equal to the cost of manifesting each of the powers associated with the psicrown once per day.</p><p>Crafting a psicrown requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.</p><p>Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Psicrown.</p></section><section id="h4-32-creating-psionic-tattoos"><h4>Creating Psionic Tattoos</h4><p>The creator of a psionic tattoo must have a patch of uncovered skin free of hair and fur, and at least a few containers in which to mix dyes. In addition, he needs special materials, usually to create dyes. The costs for materials and dyes are subsumed in the cost for scribing the psionic tattoo— 25 gp x the level of the power x the level of the manifester. All ingredients and materials used to scribe a psionic tattoo must be fresh and unused. The character must pay the full cost for scribing each psionic tattoo. (Economies of scale do not apply.)</p><p>The user of the psionic tattoo is both the manifester and the target; therefore, powers that target another creaturecannot be stored in psionic tattoo form. Powers with a range of personal can be made into psionic tattoos, but they cost double the price of standard psionic tattoos.</p><p>The creator must know the power to be placed in the psionic tattoo (or must have the power available in some other form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s XP total, he pays the XP cost upon beginning the scribing in addition to the experience point cost for making the psionic tattoo itself. The act of scribing triggers the power as if it had been manifested, costing the character an appropriate number of power points.</p><p>Scribing a psionic tattoo requires one day.</p><p>Item Creation Feat Required: Scribe Tattoo.</p></section><section id="h4-33-creating-universal-items"><h4>Creating Universal Items</h4><p>To create a universal item, a character usually needs some sort of equipment or tools to work on the item. He also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the item itself or the pieces of the item to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the item. Universal item costs are difficult to formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Valuesand use the given item prices as a guideline. Creating an item costs half the market value listed.</p><p>If powers are involved in the prerequisites for making the item, the creator must know the power to be placed in the item (or must have the power available in some other form). Any experience point cost for a prerequisite power is not incurred by the creator of the item. The act of working on the item requires a payment of power points appropriate to the power or powers associated with the item during each day of the item’s creation.</p><p>Crafting a universal item requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.</p><p>Item Creation Feat Required: Craft Universal Item.</p></section></section><section id="h1-34-special-materials"><h1>SPECIAL MATERIALS</h1><p>In addition to psionic items with imbedded powers, some substances have innate special properties.</p><p><strong>Crystal, Deep:</strong> Deep crystal is crystal of above-average quality found at the hearts of large veins or deposits of mundane crystal (see below). Deep crystal is renowned for its strength and its psionically resonant nature. Mundane crystal is used for many items of psionic manufacture, such as dorjes, power stones, and psicrystals. Deep crystal is a better grade.</p><p>While a weapon made of deep crystal is no different from a mundane crystal weapon for a nonpsionic character, a psionic wielder of a deep crystal weapon can focus psionic power through it, increasing the damage that weapon deals. As a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, the wielder can channel psionic power into a melee weapon or ranged weapon made of deep crystal. For 2 power points, the deep crystal weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. The weapon will stay charged for 1 minute or until it scores its next hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this power on their ammunition. All missile weapons lose this effect if they miss. However, they may be recovered and charged again.</p><p>Any weapon made of deep crystal costs 1,000 gp more than its noncrystal counterpart. Any item could potentially be made out of deep crystal. Because deep crystal armor is considered to be made out of metal, druids cannot wear it.</p><p>Deep crystal has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and a hardness of 10.</p><p><strong>Crystal, Mundane:</strong> Mundane crystal can be used in place of metal in weapons or armor, using a special forging process. The fortified crystal possesses the properties of a similar masterwork steel weapon or armor, except for visual appearance.</p><p>Weapons and armor made of mundane crystal cost the same amount to make as their masterwork counterparts. Any item could potentially be made with mundane crystal. Because mundane crystal armor is considered to be made out of metal, druids cannot wear it.</p><p>Mundane crystal properly forged has 25 hit points per inch of thickness and a hardness of 8.</p></section></body></html>
