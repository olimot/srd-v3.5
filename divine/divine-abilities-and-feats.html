    <h1>SALIENT DIVINE ABILITIES</h1>
    <p>
      A salient divine ability is like a feat—it gives a deity a new capability or improves one that the deity already
      has. A deity has one salient divine ability for each divine rank the deity has, plus additional salient divine
      abilities reflecting its status: Demigods receive one bonus ability, lesser deities receive two bonus abilities,
      intermediate deities receive three, and greater deities receive five.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some salient divine abilities have prerequisites. Usually, the deity must have all the listed prerequisites to
      have the ability. A divine rank of 1 is a prerequisite for all salient divine abilities. The most common salient
      divine abilities are described here. A few deities have unique salient divine abilities that are described in the
      deity’s individual entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Using Salient Divine Abilities:</strong> Using a salient divine ability is a standard action unless
      otherwise noted in the ability description. Using a salient divine ability does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Salient Divine Abilities and Antimagic:</strong> A salient divine ability functions normally within an
      antimagic field, and is never subject to spell resistance.

    <h2 id="salient-divine-ability-descriptions">Salient Divine Ability Descriptions</h2>
    <p>Here is the format for salient divine ability descriptions.</p>
    <h2 id="ability-name">Ability Name</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> A minimum divine rank, minimum ability score, another salient divine ability, a
      minimum base attack bonus, a feat, a skill, or some other condition that a deity must have in order to acquire
      this salient divine ability. This entry is absent if a salient divine ability has no prerequisite. An ability may
      have more than one prerequisite. All salient divine abilities have a minimum prerequisite of divine rank 1.
      Quasi-deities (rank 0) have no salient divine abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> What the ability enables the deity to do. If a deity has the same ability more than
      once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description. In general, having a salient divine
      ability twice is the same as having it once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> Additional facts about the ability that may be helpful when using the ability in play.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rest:</strong> Some abilities require the deity to rest afterward. If no rest is required, the entry is
      absent. A resting deity can engage in light activities such as talking or walking at half speed. When attempting
      anything more strenuous than that, the deity can only take partial actions and suffers a –6 penalty on all attack
      rolls, saves, and checks. The deity cannot use another ability that requires rest until its current rest
      requirement is fulfilled. Any time the deity spends performing strenuous activities does not count toward the
      required rest time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> This entry gives one or more portfolio elements that are associated
      with the salient divine ability in question. The information is provided as guidance and should not be taken as a
      rule.
    </p>
    <h2 id="alter-form">Alter Form</h2>
    <p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Alter Size salient divine ability.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> As a move-equivalent action, the deity can alter its form, including clothing and
      equipment. The assumed form must be corporeal. The deity’s body can undergo a limited physical transmutation,
      including adding or subtracting one or two limbs. If the form selected has wings, the deity can fly. Likewise, the
      deity can swim if the form has fins, breathe water if the form has gills, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>The deity can remain in the altered form indefinitely, but resumes its own form if slain.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> The deity’s attack bonus, Armor Class, and saves do not change. The deity does not gain
      any of the assumed form’s special abilities, attack forms, defenses, ability scores, or mannerisms. The deity can
      change physical qualities (such as hair color, hair
    </p>
    <p>
      texture, skin color, and gender). The deity can use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +10 on
      its Disguise checks. The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously along with this one to become taller,
      shorter, thinner, or heavier.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Nature, secrets, thieves.</p>
    <h2 id="alter-reality">Alter Reality</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Cha 29.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability is similar to the <i>wish</i> spell. The deity merely thinks of something
      and then makes it so. Doing this requires at least a standard action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> The deity can duplicate any spell of 9th level or lower as a standard action. The
      duplicated spell has no material or XP component, and the DC of its saving throw (if one is allowed) is 20 + the
      deity’s rank + the deity’s Charisma modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity also can duplicate a spell with any metamagic feat (so long as the metamagic feat is available to
      characters of 20th level or lower). This use of the ability requires the deity to rest for 1 round for each level
      that the feat would normally add to the spell. It still takes a standard action to use this ability, so there is
      no point in using the ability to duplicate a quickened spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity can render a magical or supernatural effect permanent. The rest requirement varies with the effect: 10
      minutes per level of the effect times the number of subjects affected, 10 minutes per total Hit Dice of creatures
      affected, or 10 minutes per 10-foot cube affected. Use the highest applicable value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity can create temporary, nonmagical objects. This works like the Create Object ability (including the
      required rest period), except that the items last one day per rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity also can create permanent nonmagical objects as if using the Create Object ability except that all rest
      requirements are doubled and there is no reduction in rest time for being on an Outer Plane or in the deity’s own
      realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity can create temporary magic items or creatures. This works like the Divine Creation ability (including
      the required rest period), except that the items or creatures created last 1 hour per rank. This ability cannot
      create permanent magic items or creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity can reshape a landscape, creating any type of terrain the deity can imagine. Each 10-foot cube of
      material to be reshaped requires 1 round of effort, and the deity must rest for one day per 10-foot cube shaped
      after the work is completed.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Any.</p>
    <h2 id="alter-size">Alter Size</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> As a free action, the deity can assume any size from Fine to Colossal. The deity also
      can change the size of up to 100 pounds of objects it touches. If the deity has a familiar, personal mount, or
      personal intelligent weapon, the creature can change size with the deity if the deity touches it, but its weight
      counts against the deity’s weight limit. This is a supernatural ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> This ability allows the deity to assume any proportions from the size of a grain of sand
      up or as much as 1,600 feet tall. A radical change in size can have great impact on the deity’s combat ability.
      The deity’s Strength, Armor Class, attack bonus, and damage dealt with weapons changes according to the size the
      deity assumes. The deity’s Strength
    </p>
    <p>
      score can never be reduced to less than 1 through this ability. Also note that use of this divine ability does not
      affect all the deities’ characteristics.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Any.</p>
    <h2 id="annihilating-strike">Annihilating Strike</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 11, base attack bonus +20, Str 25.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When the deity strikes with a weapon or natural weapon, the opponent struck might be
      obliterated. Creatures, attended objects, and magic items must make Fortitude saves (DC 20 + the deity’s rank +
      the damage dealt) or be reduced to –10 hit points and killed outright. Unattended, nonmagical objects are
      obliterated. The deity can destroy up to 1,000 cubic feet (a 10-foot cube) of nonliving matter per rank, so the
      ability destroys only part of any very large object or structure targeted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> Deities with a rank equal to or greater than the attacking deity are not subject to this
      ability. This ability has no effect on objects or effects that are not subject to physical attacks.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death, justice, vengeance, war.</p>
    <h2 id="arcane-mastery">Arcane Mastery</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Spellcaster level 1st, Int 29, Spell Mastery.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can prepare any wizard spell that it can cast without using a spellbook.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> This ability gives the deity access to every spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list,
      provided that the deity has sufficient wizard levels and a sufficient Intelligence score to cast them. The deity
      also can invent new sorcerer/wizard spells without researching them.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Knowledge, magic.</p>
    <h2 id="area-divine-shield">Area Divine Shield</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Cha 29, Divine Shield salient divine ability.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Except where noted here, this ability works like the Divine Shield ability. The deity
      produces a transparent barrier whose area is up to one 10-foot square per rank, or a sphere or hemisphere with a
      radius of up to 1 foot per rank. The barrier can be placed anywhere within the deity’s line of sight. The deity
      can place the barrier so that it is mobile with respect to some unattended object or willing creature. The barrier
      can be adjusted to ignore certain types of damage, just as a divine shield can. If the deity makes the shield
      mobile with respect to a willing creature, the deity also can make the barrier
    </p>
    <p>
      one-way with respect to the creature and its allies, allowing them to attack through the shield and still use its
      protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> The deity can shape the shield around itself or around a willing creature so that it is
      skintight, which prevents the subject from being touched.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Mercy, protection.</p>
    <h2 id="automatic-metamagic">Automatic Metamagic</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Spellcaster level 1st.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity chooses one metamagic feat. As a free action, the deity can apply the selected
      feat to the spells from any one spellcasting class the deity has or to its spell-like abilities. A spell altered
      by the use of this ability does not use up a higher-level slot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> The deity must obey all the limitations normally associated with the metamagic feat. Any
      metamagic feat selected cannot have a level requirement of 21st or higher. Feats that depend on making the spell’s
      level higher, such as Heighten Spell, do not work with this ability. A deity can have this ability multiple times,
      choosing a metamagic feat and either a spellcasting class or spell-like abilities to which the ability will apply
      each time.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Knowledge, magic.</p>
    <h2 id="avatar">Avatar</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Cha 29.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> An avatar serves as a deity’s alter ego, effectively allowing the deity to be in two or
      more places at the same time. An avatar is an extension of a deity. The deity senses and knows everything the
      avatar senses and knows and vice versa. Each avatar counts as a remote location where the deity is sensing and
      communicating. A lesser deity can have up to five avatars at once, an intermediate deity can have up to ten, and a
      greater deity can have up to twenty avatars at once. It takes a deity one year to create an avatar or replace a
      destroyed avatar. The process does not require any special effort on the deity’s
    </p>
    <p>
      part. An avatar must be created in the deity’s own realm. If the deity has the Divine Creation salient divine
      ability, the deity can use it to create a new avatar anywhere. However, the deity must rest afterward as noted in
      the Divine Creation ability description. An avatar is a less powerful version of a deity, created by modifying the
      deity’s statistics, that has the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Divine Rank:</em> The avatar’s divine rank is half that of the deity (round down). This decrease in divine
      rank affects many of the avatar’s statistics and abilities, including bonuses to attack rolls, damage, saves,

      The ability functions only when the deity personally attacks with a melee weapon or ranged weapon. The deity can
      apply the Banestrike ability to any weapon or natural weapon, but not to a spell, spell-like ability, supernatural
      ability, or divine ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of foe each time. The deity can imbue only
      one bane special ability to a weapon at a time and can change among them once a round as a free action.

    <h2 id="battlesense">Battlesense</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity cannot be surprised or flanked except by a deity of higher rank. The deity
      retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even if caught flat-footed or attacked by an invisible opponent, and is
      not subject to sneak attacks except by deities of higher rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> If the deity has the uncanny dodge or improved uncanny dodge class feature, this ability
      replaces it.

    <h2 id="call-creatures">Call Creatures</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The kind of creature the deity can call is noted in the deity’s description. Each
      creature called can have no more Hit Dice than the deity has divine ranks, and the deity cannot have more
      creatures serving it at any given time than the deity has ranks. The creatures are transported to the deity’s
      presence through an interdimensional connection similar to that created by a <i>gate</i> spell, except that it
      opens to the Material Plane. The creatures willingly serve to the best of their ability. The calling effect is
      otherwise similar to the calling property of the <i>gate</i> spell.
    </p>
    <p>

      time.

    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Wis 29.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can see illusions, transmuted creatures and objects, and disguised creatures
      or objects for what they really are, provided they are within 10 feet per divine rank of the deity. This ability
      is similar to the <i>true seeing</i> spell, except that it does not reveal creatures’ alignments and it does foil
      mundane disguises.

    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Knowledge, truth.</p>
    <h2 id="command-plants">Command Plants</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can make plants grow in a radius of up to one mile per divine rank once per
      day. The deity can use this ability even in a place where no plants grow, though in this case the plants wither
      and die after one day. This ability works like the <i>plant growth</i> spell, except that it cannot be countered
      except by a deity of higher rank than the deity using the ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also once per day, the deity can charm plant creatures, animate plants, or make them entangle its foes. This
      ability functions like the
      <i>command plants</i> spell, except that its maximum duration is one day no matter which option the deity chooses.
      At any one time, the deity can charm a number of plant creatures equal to its divine rank with this ability,
      regardless of Hit Dice.

    <h2 id="control-creatures">Control Creatures</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can command some kind of creature as noted in the deity’s description. This
      ability is similar to the <i>dominate monster</i> spell, but it is not a mind-affecting ability (the deity seizes
      direct control over the creature’s body). Each day the deity can attempt to control a number of creature equal to
      its divine rank. The deity can attempt to take control of that number all at once, or in smaller numbers. All
      creatures to
    </p>
    <p>
      be affected must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected. Once control is established, distance is
      not a factor and the deity can maintain control remotely, even across planes and through wards or barriers (except
      divine shields and warding spells cast by deities of higher rank than the deity using the ability). The subject is
      allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity’s rank + the deity’s Charisma modifier) to resist and is allowed a
    </p>
    <p>new save if the deity commands the subject to do something against its nature.</p>
    <p>
      At any given time, the deity cannot have more creatures under its control than 10 times its divine rank. If the
      deity already has the maximum number of creatures under its control, it can still attempt to take control of other
      creatures, but must first release one or more creatures already under its control.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of creature each
      time.

    <h2 id="create-object">Create Object</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Int 29.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> As a full-round action, the deity can create one or more simple, nonmagical objects with
      a total weight of up to 50 pounds per divine rank, or with a total volume of 10 cubic feet per rank. If the deity
      uses this ability on a divinely morphic plane or within its own godly realm, double the volume and weight the
      deity can create. If the deity’s realm is located on a divinely morphic plane, triple the volume and weight the
      deity can create there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> For purposes of this ability, a simple object can have no moving parts more complex than a
      door hinge and must be composed of a single material. The material can be no more valuable than iron (1 sp per
      pound). Once created, the objects are permanent and nonmagical. If the deity has the appropriate Craft skill, the
      deity can make a Craft

    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 11, Int 29, Create Object salient divine ability.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> As a full-round action, the deity can create objects weighing up to 100 pounds per
      divine rank, or with a volume of 20 cubic feet per rank. If the deity uses this ability on a divinely morphic
      plane or within its own godly realm, double the volume and
    </p>
    <p>
      weight the deity can create. If the deity’s realm is located on a divinely morphic plane, triple the volume and
      weight the deity can create there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> This ability works like the Create Object ability, except as noted below. A deity can use
      this ability to create any kind of nonmagical object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rest:</strong> The deity must convert a considerable amount of its own energy into the object, which can
      leave the deity impaired. The deity can create an object with a value of up to 100 gp without impairment. For
      every additional 100 gp of value (or fraction of 100
    </p>
    <p>
      gp), the deity must rest for 10 minutes. If the deity is creating an item on a divinely morphic plane or within
      its own godly realm, it can create a 200 gp item without resting. If the deity’s realm is located on a divinely
      morphic plane, it can create a 300 gp item there without having to rest.

    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Base attack bonus +20, Dex 29, Point Blank Shot, Far Shot.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can fire a ranged weapon at any target within line of sight and within range
      of the deity’s personal senses. No range increment applies to the attack. The deity does not incur any attacks of
      opportunity for firing a bow when threatened. As a full-round action, the deity may fire an arrow at her full base
      attack bonus at each opponent within 10 feet per divine rank. The deity must have the Weapon Focus feat with the
      type of bow she uses to perform this attack. When shooting a ranged weapon, the deity can ignore any cover bonus
      to the target’s AC or any miss chance conferred by the target’s concealment.

    <h2 id="divine-bard">Divine Bard</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Bard level 20th.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability has several benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For the deity’s bardic abilities that have a range (countersong,
        <i>fascinate,</i> inspire competence, inspire greatness), that range is a number of miles equal to the deity’s
        divine rank.
      </li>
      <li>
        The deity can use any bardic music inspiration ability as a standard action. The inspiration takes effect
        immediately after the deity concludes the action.
      </li>
      <li>
        The deity’s bardic music abilities can affect even those normally immune to mind-affecting effects. However,
        such creatures gain a +10 bonus on their Will saves to resist such effects.
      </li>
      <li>
        The effects of all the deity’s bardic music abilities are doubled. Inspire courage grants a +8 morale bonus on
        saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +8 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls; inspire
        competence grants a +4 competence bonus on skill checks; inspire greatness grants +4d10 Hit Dice, a +4
        competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 competence bonus on Fortitude saves, and inspire heroics grants a +8
        morale bonus on saving throws and a +8 dodge bonus to AC. The number of allies the deity can affect with inspire
        competence, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics doubles. When inspiring competence in multiple allies, the
        deity can choose different skills to inspire for different allies.
      </li>
      <li>
        The effects of the deity’s bardic music inspiration abilities last for ten times as long as normal after the
        deity stops singing. This has no effect on inspiration abilities that have no duration after the bard stops
        singing.
      </li>
      <li>
        When any effect that is subject to countersong (any spell, supernatural ability, or spell-like effect that has
        the sonic or language-dependent desriptor) occurs within the deity’s hearing, the deity can attempt a
        countersong as if it had prepared an action to do so.

      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fighter level 20th, Combat Reflexes, Int 13, Dex 13, Dodge, Expertise, Mobility,
      Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, War domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can make an unlimited number of attacks of opportunity in one round. (The
      deity still can’t make more than one attack of opportunity against a single opponent in a round.) As a full-round
      action, the deity may make one melee attack at its full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. The
      deity does not incur any attacks of opportunity from this action.

    <h2 id="divine-blast">Divine Blast</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Cha 29.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + its Charisma
      bonus. The ray created can extend up to one mile per rank (the deity chooses the length). Targets the ray strikes
      take 1d12 points of damage per rank of the deity, plus 1d12
    </p>
    <p>
      points of damage per point of Charisma bonus the deity has. There is no saving throw, but the deity must make a
      ranged touch attack to hit a target. The deity can make the ray look, sound, smell, and feel like any-thing it
      desires. Despite the appearance of the ray,
    </p>
    <p>
      the damage it deals results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by
      <i>protection from elements</i> and similar magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> The ray destroys a <i>wall of force, prismatic wall,</i> or <i>prismatic sphere</i> it
      hits (all layers in a prismatic effect are destroyed). The ray itself is unaffected and can strike a target behind
      the <i>wall of force</i> or prismatic effect.

      Charisma. The deity must have a score of at least 40 in the selected ability. The deity can grant mortals a +6
      enhancement bonus to that ability that lasts for one day. In a single day and at one time, the deity can affect a
      number of creatures equal to its divine rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different ability score each
      time.

    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Agility, beauty, endurance, knowledge, strength, wisdom.</p>
    <h2 id="divine-celerity">Divine Celerity</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Dex 29.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity acts as if <i>hasted</i> for a number of minutes per day equal to its divine

    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Travel, wind.</p>
    <h2 id="divine-creation">Divine Creation</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 16, Int 29, Create Object salient divine ability, Create Greater
      Object salient divine ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> As a full-round action, the deity can create mortal creatures or magic items whose total
      weight is up to 100 pounds per divine rank, or with a total volume of 20 cubic feet per rank. If the deity uses
      this ability on a divinely morphic plane or within its
    </p>
    <p>
      own godly realm, double the volume and weight the deity can create. If the deity’s realm is located on a divinely
      morphic plane, triple the volume and weight the deity can create there.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This ability works like the Create Greater Object ability, except as noted below.</p>
    <p>
      A deity can use this ability to create any kind of creature that does not have a divine rank. The deity can create
      a creature with class levels, but never with more class levels than the deity has itself or the deity’s divine
      rank, whichever is lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rest:</strong> The deity must convert a considerable amount of its own energy into a creature, which
      always leaves the deity impaired. The deity must rest for 10 minutes ×the creature’s Hit Dice ×the creature’s
      Challenge Rating for each creature created, with a minimum of 10 minutes per creature. If the creature has class
      levels, each level counts as an additional Hit Die.
    </p>
    <p>The deity can create any kind of magic item except an artifact.</p>
    <p>The rest requirement for creating magic items is the same as for the Create Greater object ability.</p>

    <h2 id="divine-dodge">Divine Dodge</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Dex 29.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Any physical attack or individually targeted spell directed at the deity has a percent
      miss chance equal to 50 + the deity’s rank. Area effects that include the deity have a similar chance to be
      ineffective.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> The ability is similar to the <i>blink</i> spell, except that it is defensive only and the
      deity does not move to the Ethereal Plane, but simply exits from reality for a brief moment. This ability never
      interferes with the deity’s own attacks. If an attack overcomes the miss chance, the deity still gets the benefit
      of a saving throw (if one is allowed).

      <strong>Benefit:</strong> While in a <i>wild shape,</i>the deity gains all the extraordinary and supernatural
      abilities of the creature whose form it adopts. In addition to animal forms, the deity can take the form of
      magical beasts or plant creatures. Some deities can assume additional forms. These are specified in the deity’s

    <h2 id="divine-earth-mastery">Divine Earth Mastery</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Earth domain.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity gains a competence bonus on attack rolls, damage, and Armor Class equal to its
      divine rank if both the deity and its foe are touching the ground. The deity gains a burrow speed commensurate
      with its size (see Divine Characteristics), as well as the ability to glide through stone, dirt, or almost any
      other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. This burrowing leaves behind no tunnel
      or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. The deity has tremorsense, allowing it to
      automatically sense the location of anything within 10 feet per divine rank that is in contact with the ground.
      The deity has complete control over all things made of earth (including stone and metal). It can alter the form of
      any amount of earth as a free action. The deity can duplicate the effects of the
      <i>stone shape, move earth, rusting grasp, transmute rock to mud, transmute mud to rock,</i>
      and <i>disintegrate</i> spells, with any earth, stone, or metal object as a target. The deity can also transmute
      any object made of earth,
    </p>
    <p>
      stone, or metal into a different kind of earth, stone, or metal. The deity can affect any object it can see, but

      instantly when pressed against the wound on the body.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This ability does not stack with the fast healing special quality.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, and its effects stack. A deity with two
      applications of this ability improves its fast healing by 40 + (divine rank ×2).

      divine rank if both the deity and its foe are touching fire or using weapons with the flaming or flaming burst
      special abilities.
    </p>
    <p>The deity is immune to the effects of fire and heat.</p>
    <p>
      The deity can automatically know the location of any corporeal creature within 10 feet per divine rank by sensing
      the disturbance in the ambient temperature that the creature causes.

    <p>
      The deity has complete control over all nonmagical fire and can duplicate the effect of any spell with the fire

      <strong>Benefit:</strong> As a full-round action, the deity can speak and convince others to take some course of

      which can be more than (10 ×divine rank) feet apart. The save DC is 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the
      deity’s divine rank.

    <h2 id="divine-inspiration">Divine Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can enchant creatures to create a specific emotion. The deity can affect one
      creature per divine rank at once, and up to the same number each day. All must be within the deity’s line of sight
      when first affected. The specific effects depend on the emotional state induced.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Courage:</em> The enchanted creatures become immune to fear effects and receive a +2 morale bonus on attack
      rolls, weapon damage rolls, skill checks, and Will saves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Despair:</em> The enchanted creatures are affected as by an improved version of the
      <i>crushing despair</i> spell: affected creatures suffer a –4 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, saves, and
      checksunless they make a successful Will save (DC 10 + deity’s Charisma modifier + deity’s divine rank). The
      effect lasts one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Dread:</em> The enchanted creatures must make successful Wisdom checks (DC = the deity’s divine rank) to
      attack or fight. If the check fails, the creature flees in panic for 1d4 rounds. If the check succeeds, the
      creature does not have to check again for
    </p>
    <p>
      10 minutes. The enchanted creatures also suffer a –2 morale penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, skill
      checks, and Will saves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Frenzy:</em> Frenzied creatures spend themselves in drinking, feasting, and dancing unless provoked or incited
      to violence. Frenzied creatures turn violent if they are attacked or perceive a threat to their safety. Frenzied
      creatures receive a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Dexterity, a –4 penalty to Wisdom, and a –2 penalty to AC.
      Subjects can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + deity’s Charisma modifier + deity’s divine rank) to resist the effect.
      This is a mind-affecting compulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Hope:</em> The enchanted creatures gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks,
      skill checks, and weapon damage rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Rage:</em> The enchanted creatures receive a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution scores, a +2 morale
      bonus on Will saves, and a –2 penalty to AC. They are compelled to fight heedless of danger. Subjects can attempt
      Will saves (DC 10 + deity’s Charisma
    </p>
    <p>modifier + deity’s divine rank) to resist the effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Love and Desire:</em> A love effect causes the target to fall in love with the specified creature, seeking
      every opportunity to be near that creature and making every effort to win the creature’s affection. A desire
      effect is similar, but the target seeks any opportunity to
    </p>
    <p>
      become physically intimate with the specified creature. Subjects can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + deity’s Charisma
      modifier + deity’s divine rank) to resist the effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.

    <h2 id="divine-monk">Divine Monk</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Monk level 20th.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity’s unarmed strikes are treated as a magic slashing weapon with an enhancement
      bonus of +5 and the keen, lawful, and vorpal qualities. If the deity chooses, a particular attack can be
      bludgeoning instead of slashing, but the keen and vorpal qualities do not apply to that attack. Any unarmed attack
      the deity makes has a base damage of 2d12.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity can use the Deflect Arrows feat to deflect any ranged attacks (including spells that require ranged
      touch attacks) as if they were arrows. The deity can deflect any number of attacks in a single round. When the
      deity deflects any attack, the attack is reflected upon the attacker, using the deity’s base ranged attack bonus.
      When the deity deflects a spell, the spell’s level is added to the DC to deflect the attack. The deity only gains
      the second benefit of this ability if he or she has the Deflect Arrows feat.

    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity’s aura of courage grants a +8 morale bonus on saving throws against fear
      effects and extends to all allies within 100 feet of the deity.
    </p>
    <p>The deity’s special mount, if any, gains the celestial template.</p>
    <p>
      The deity can smite evil ten times per day, and gets an extra 3 points of damage per class level on a successful
      smite attempt.

    <h2 id="divine-radiance">Divine Radiance</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Good alignment, Sun domain.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can shed light in a (10 feet ×divine rank) emanation from its body. This light
      counters and dispels all darkness effects (unless created by a deity of higher rank) and causes pain and damage to
      undead creatures, who take 2d8 points of damage per round with no save. As a full attack action, the deity can
      generate up to three rays of scorching light that can strike targets up to a number of miles away equal to the
      deity’s divine rank. Each ray deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 divine ranks. Undead take 1d12 points of damage per
      2 divine ranks.

    <h2 id="divine-rage">Divine Rage</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Barbarian level 20th.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability is similar to the barbarian’s rage ability (and it replaces the barbarian
      rage ability for the deity). The deity can activate this ability only after suffering damage from a weapon, and
      can use it a number of times per day equal to its divine rank. Once used, the ability lasts 1 hour (though the
      deity can end the rage at will). While raging, the deity gains +10 to Strength, +10 to Constitution, and a +5
      morale bonus on Will saves. The deity’s spell resistance and energy resistances each increase by +10. The deity
      also can make one extra attack, at its full attack bonus, whenever it uses the full attack action. While raging,
      the deity suffers a –5 penalty to Armor Class and cannot perform acts that require patience and concentration,
      such as moving silently, casting spells, and using salient divine abilities.

      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ranger level 20th, Wis 25, Wilderness Lore 40 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 30 ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Any weapon the deity wields against one of its favored enemies is treated as a bane
      weapon against that creature type. Thus, its enhancement bonus is increased by +2 and it deals +2d6 points of
      damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity can follow tracks at its normal land speed. It treats all normal terrain as very soft ground for
      purposes of tracking and ignores DC modifiers for time or weather. The deity can track creatures across water,
      underwater, or through the air by means of the minute disturbances they make and traces of their passage. The
      table below adds across water, underwater, and air to the list of surfaces found in the Track feat description.

      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity remembers every event of a certain type that has ever occurred. The type of
      event is specified in the deity description.

      <strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different type of event each
      time.

    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Rogue level 20th, Dodge, improved evasion, defensive roll.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When struck by an attack from an opponent the deity has designated as its dodge target,
      the deity may make a Reflex save (DC 10 + damage dealt) to negate all damage from the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the deity passes within 5 feet of a trap, the deity is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if the deity
      were actively looking for it.
    </p>
    <p>The deity can assess the exact value of any treasure it can see.</p>
    <p>The deity also can immediately determine what any creature is carrying and where each carried item is.</p>

    <h2 id="divine-shield">Divine Shield</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Cha 29.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> As a free action, the deity can create a shield that lasts 10 minutes and protects the
      deity’s body and equipment from attacks. The shield stops 10 points of damage per rank. Once the shield stops that
      much damage, it collapses. The damage can be from any source, including a divine blast attack. The deity can use
      this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + its Constitution bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> The deity can adjust the shield so that it does not block damage the deity ignores anyway.
      The effects of multiple divine shields do not stack.

    <h2 id="divine-skill-focus">Divine Skill Focus</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 23 ranks in the selected skill.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity receives a bonus of 10 + its divine rank when using the skill selected.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> This bonus stacks with the divine rank bonus deities normally receive on checks. If the
      selected skill is related to the deity’s portfolio, add the deity’s rank to the maximum DC for a free action.
    </p>
    <p>A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different skill each time.</p>

    <h2 id="divine-sneak-attack">Divine Sneak Attack</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Sneak attack +10d6, crippling strike.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity’s sneak attacks deal an additional +3d6 points of damage.</p>
    <p>Any attack of opportunity the deity makes is considered a sneak attack.</p>
    <p>
      The deity can flank or catch flat-footed any opponent whose divine rank does not exceed the deity’s and can sneak
      attack that opponent. The deity cannot deal sneak attack damage to opponents that are immune to critical hits. Any
      time the deity inflicts damage with a sneak attack, that target suffers damage equal to the deity’s sneak attack
      bonus damage on the deity’s next turn as well.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Thieves.</p>
    <h2 id="divine-spell-focus">Divine Spell Focus</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Spell Focus, Greater Spell Focus.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity chooses one school of magic. The save DC for any spell of that school
      increases by one-half the deity’s divine rank. This bonus overlaps (does not stack with) the bonus from Spell
      Focus or Greater Spell Focus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different school of magic each
      time.

    <h2 id="divine-spellcasting">Divine Spellcasting</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Spellcaster level 20th.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can cast spells whose effective level is above 9th. The number of spells per
      day the deity can cast of each spell level above 9th depends on the deity’s key ability score for spell-casting
      classes in which the deity has achieved 20th level, as shown
    </p>
    <p>
      on Table: Divine Spellcasting. The numbers on that table represent one spell per day at each spell level above 9th
      in which it receives bonus spells from its key ability score, plus
    </p>
    <p>
      bonus spells based on the key ability score. The deity can use these slots for spells prepared or cast with a
      metamagic feat, or for lower-level spells.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the deity has achieved 20th level in a spellcasting class with fewer than nine levels of spells (such as bard,
      paladin, or ranger), the deity can also cast one spell per day of each level between the maximum normal spell
      level and 9th, plus appropriate bonus spells
    </p>
    <p>of each level based on the deity’s key ability score. These spells are not shown on the table.</p>
    <p>The deity also doesn’t incur attacks of opportunity for casting spells when threatened.</p>
    <p>In addition, the deity receives the benefit of the Spell Focus feat on any spell it casts.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Magic.</p>
    <h3 id="spell-slots-above-9th-level">Spell Slots Above 9th Level</h3>
    <p>
      The Divine Spellcasting ability grants deities access to spell slots above 9th level (which can be used to hold
      lower-level spells or spells whose level has been increased above 9th by the use of metamagic feats). The number
      of spell slots available to a deity depends on the deity’s key ability score (Intelligence for wizards, Wisdom for
      clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers, and Charisma for bards and sorcerers), as shown on Table: Divine
      Spellcasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the table only includes ability scores up to 61 and spell slots up to 25th level, the progression
      continues infinitely in both directions. For ability scores beyond 61, or for spell slots above 25th level, expand
      the table to follow the same patterns as shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The numbers on this table include bonus spells that a deity receives for having a sufficiently high ability score,
      as well as one additional spell of each level at which the deity gains at least one bonus spell. This additional
      spell is one of the benefits of the
    </p>
    <p>Divine Spellcasting salient divine ability.</p>

    <h2 id="divine-splendor">Divine Splendor</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 16, Cha 26.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Any mortal who approaches within 10 feet per divine rank of the deity in its natural
      form dies immediately, with no saving throw.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Supreme.</p>
    <h2 id="divine-storm">Divine Storm</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Divine rank 11.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can surround itself with a vortex of holy or unholy force that manifests in
      different forms depending on the deity. The vortex extends from the deity in an emanation with a radius of 10 feet
      per divine rank. The effect stops attacks with thrown weapons and projectiles (they fail if made by creatures
      inside the area, or targeted at creatures within the area, or if their paths take them through the area).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the force expels creatures whose alignment on the ethical (lawful-chaotic) axis is opposite the
      deity’s. If the deity’s ethical alignment is neutral (neutral good or neutral evil), the force does not expel any
      creatures. Affected creatures in the area must make Fortitude saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the
      deity’s divine rank) or be picked up and thrown out, regardless of size. Such creatures suffer 1d6 points of
    </p>
    <p>
      damage for each 10 feet they travel. Creatures that make successful saves are not affected by the vortex for one
      day, although the vortex still stops their thrown weapons and projectiles. Creatures that fail their saves can
      attempt to reenter the area, but must attempt new saves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The force damages creatures whose alignment on the moral (good-evil) axis is opposite the deity’s. If the deity’s
      moral alignment is neutral (lawful neutral or chaotic neutral), the force does not damage any creatures. Affected
      creatures in the area must make Fortitude saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank)
      each round or suffer 1 point of holy damage per divine rank. A successful save negates the damage, but the
      creature must save again the next round if it is still within the area.
    </p>
    <p>Creatures whose alignment is diametrically opposed to the deity’s are subject to both effects.</p>

    <h2 id="divine-water-mastery">Divine Water Mastery</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Water domain.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity gains a competence bonus on attack, damage, and Armor Class equal to its
      divine rank if both the deity and its foe are touching the same body of water.
    </p>
    <p>The deity gains a swim speed commensurate with its size (see Divine Characteristics).</p>
    <p>
      At will, as a full-round action, the deity can create a devastating tidal wave of water. On land, the wave has
      effects similar to a flash flood: Creatures caught in the water must
    </p>
    <p>make a Fortitude save (DC 15). Large or smaller creatures that fail the save are swept</p>
    <p>away, taking 1d6 points of subdual damage per round (1d3 points on a successful</p>
    <p>
      Swim check against DC 20). Huge creatures that fail are knocked down, while Gar-gantuan and Colossal creatures are
      checked. The wave destroys all wooden buildings and
    </p>
    <p>
      25% of the stone buildings it comes into contact with. At sea, the tidal wave capsizes ships and crushes them to
      splinters. The wave affects a number of miles of coastland up to the deity’s divine rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      When touching water, the deity can automatically sense the location of anything within 10 feet per divine rank
      that is in contact with the same body of water.

    <h2 id="divine-weapon-focus">Divine Weapon Focus</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability works like the Weapon Focus feat except that the deity receives a bonus of
      +4 on attacks with the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> This bonus stacks with the divine rank bonus deities get on attack rolls, and with the
      Divine Weapon Mastery salient divine ability. It also stacks with the Weapon Focus and Greater Weapon Focus feats.
    </p>
    <p>A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of weapon each time.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> War.</p>
    <h2 id="divine-weapon-mastery">Divine Weapon Mastery</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fighter level 20th, War domain.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity receives the benefits of the Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, and Improved
      Critical feats when wielding any simple or martial weapon.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> War.</p>
    <h2 id="divine-weapon-specialization">Divine Weapon Specialization</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Base attack bonus +20, Divine Weapon Focus salient divine ability with the
      selected weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability works like the fighter’s Weapon Specialization feat, except that the deity
      receives a bonus on damage with the weapon equal to its divine rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> If the selected weapon is a ranged weapon, the extra damage applies against any target the
      deity can see.
    </p>
    <p>
      The damage bonus from this ability stacks with the damage bonus from the Divine Weapon Mastery ability and the
      Weapon Specialization and Greater Weapon Specialization feats.
    </p>
    <p>A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of weapon each time.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> War.</p>
    <h2 id="energy-burst">Energy Burst</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can create an emanation of a specific type of energy (acid, cold, electricity,
      fire, or sonic energy, specified in the deity’s description) with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. Anything in
      the area takes 1d8 points of the appropriate energy damage per divine rank. Damage is halved for those who make
      successful saving throws (Reflex for acid, cold, electricity, or fire, or Fortitude for sonic energy; DC 10 + the
      deity’s divine rank + the deity’s Constitution modifier).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different type of energy each
      time.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Nature.</p>
    <h2 id="energy-storm">Energy Storm</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Divine rank 11.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can surround itself with a vortex of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire,
      sonic, positive, or negative energy, specified in the deity’s description). The vortex extends from the deity in
      an emanation with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. The effect
    </p>
    <p>
      stops attacks with thrown weapons and projectiles. Such attacks fail if made by creatures inside the area, or
      targeted at creatures within the area, or if their paths take them through the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Energy storms that use acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic energy deal 1 point of energy damage and 1 point of
      holy damage per divine rank each round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Positive energy deals 1 point of damage per divine rank to undead creatures, and heals the same amount of damage
      on living creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Negative energy deals 1 point of negative energy per divine rank to living creatures, and heals the same amount of
      damage on undead creatures.

      time.

    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity chooses one domain to add to its list of domains. The deity can grant spells
      and powers from that domain and use those spells and powers personally, just as it can the spells and powers of
      its other domains.

    <h2 id="extra-sense-enhancement">Extra Sense Enhancement</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wis 29.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity chooses one sense to enhance. The ability can extend a sense’s range one mile
      per divine rank, or it can allow the sense to ignore one type of physical or magical blockage. The enhanced sense
      can penetrate 10 feet of a physical barrier per rank or 100 feet of a less tangible barrier (such as fog or smoke)
      per rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> Some deities have specific applications of this ability that go beyond the normal senses.

    <h2 id="footsore">Footsore</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Travel domain.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can sap the energy from living creatures so that they feel tired. It can
      affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than one creature per divine rank each day. All
      must be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected. Subjects
    </p>
    <p>
      can attempt Fortitude saves (DC 10 + deity’s Charisma modifier + deity’s divine rank). Creatures who fail their
      saves become fatigued and their speed is reduced by half. Furthermore, any mount or vehicle they ride is likewise
      slowed. The effect lasts one day.

    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Travel.</p>
    <h2 id="free-move">Free Move</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 29, Divine Celerity salient divine ability.</p>

    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Travel.</p>
    <h2 id="frightful-presence">Frightful Presence</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Cha 24.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever the deity performs a specific action specified in the deity’s description
      (usually attacking, but sometimes making an intimidating gesture), foes within a 30-foot-radius burst must make
      Will saves (DC 10 + deity’s Charisma modifier + deity’s divine rank). Foes within the burst, but not the deity’s
      immediate target, become shaken for 3d6 rounds if they fail their saves. Creatures the deity attacks when it
      activates the ability become panicked for 3d6 rounds if they fail their saves. Foes who make successful saving
      throws are unaffected by this ability for one day.

    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Destruction, war.</p>
    <h2 id="gift-of-life">Gift of Life</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity restores the dead creature to life, no matter how long the creature has been
      dead or what the condition of the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> This ability works like the <i>true resurrection</i> spell, except that there is no
      material component and the amount of time the subject has been dead is irrelevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ability can restore a creature to life against its will, but only with the permission of whatever deity rules
      the underworld or the divine realm where the mortal’s soul resides. This ability can resurrect an elemental or
      outsider and can resurrect a creature whose soul is trapped, provided the soul is not held by a deity of higher
      rank than the one using this ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ability cannot restore life to a creature that has been slain by the Hand of Death ability or the Life and
      Death ability of a deity with a higher rank.

    <h2 id="grow-creature">Grow Creature</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability works like the <i>animal growth</i> spell, except that it can affect up to
      one creature of the specified type per divine rank each day, all of which must be within the deity’s line of sight
      when first affected. The effect lasts one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different type of creature each
      time.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Nature.</p>
    <h2 id="hand-of-death">Hand of Death</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity points to any mortal within the deity’s sensory range and snuffs out its life.
      There must be an unbroken line of effect between the deity and the target.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> This ability works like the <i>destruction</i> spell, except that there is no material
      component. The mortal is allowed a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 20 + the deity’s Charisma bonus + the
      deity’s divine rank. Even if the save succeeds, the subject takes 10d6 points of damage, which may kill it anyway.
      If the attack kills the mortal (either through a failed saving throw or through damage), the mortal cannot be
      raised or resurrected afterward, except by a deity of equal or higher rank using the Gift of Life, Life and Death,
      or Mass Life and Death salient divine ability.

    <h2 id="increased-damage-reduction">Increased Damage Reduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Con 29.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity’s damage reduction increases 5 and adds an alignment requirement opposed to
      the deity’s alignment to bypass the damage reduction. For example, a lawful good deity with DR25/epic would gain
      DR 30/epic and evil or DR 30 epic and chaotic.

    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity gains resistance equal to its divine rank to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or
      sonic energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different form of energy each
      time. The deity also can have this ability more than once for a single type of energy. When applied to an energy
      type that the deity already resists, this ability increases the resistance by 10.

    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Any.</p>
    <h2 id="increased-spell-resistance">Increased Spell Resistance</h2>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity’s spell resistance increases by 20.</p>
    <p>

      applications of this ability improves its spell resistance by 40.

    <h2 id="indomitable-strength">Indomitable Strength</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Str 40, Strength domain.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> If required to make an opposed roll involving Strength (including grapple checks), the

    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Strength.</p>
    <h2 id="instant-counterspell">Instant Counterspell</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When any spell is cast within the deity’s line of sight, the deity can counterspell it
      as a free action, provided that the deity is capable of casting the spell immediately or has it as a spell-like
      ability and makes the required Spellcraft check. The use of Instant
    </p>
    <p>Counterspell counts against the normal number of free actions the deity is allowed each round.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Magic.</p>
    <h2 id="instant-move">Instant Move</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Dex 29.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> As a move action, the deity can travel up to 30 feet per divine rank, as though using
      the <i>dimension door</i> spell, except that the deity never appears within a solid object and can act immediately
      after teleporting.

    <h2 id="irresistible-blows">Irresistible Blows</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Weapon Focus and Improved Critical with the selected melee weapon.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When the deity makes a melee attack with the chosen weapon against a creature, resolve
      the attack as a melee touch attack (the weapon blow ignores armor and natural armor bonuses). If the weapon hits,
      the creature struck must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the deity’s Constitution modifier + the deity’s divine
      rank) or be stunned for 1d10 rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity’s attacks with the chosen weapons are considered to be adamantine for purposes of bypassing damage
      reduction and hardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of weapon each
      time.

    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> War.</p>
    <h2 id="irresistible-performance">Irresistible Performance</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Perform 40 ranks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When the deity sings, plays a musical instrument, tells jokes, recites verse, or engages
      in any other type of performance as a full-round action, the deity has the option to create any of the following
      effects. The deity can use this ability a number of times per
    </p>
    <p>
      day equal to its divine rank. It affects up to one creature per divine rank within a burst with a radius of 10
      feet per divine rank, centered on the deity.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Affected creatures become unable to take actions; instead, they dance, observe the performance with rapt
        attention, laugh, or applaud at the deity’s option. The affected creatures also suffer a –4 penalty to Armor
        Class, cannot succeed at Reflex saves (except on a roll of 20), and cannot use shields. Creatures can resist
        this mind effect with a successful Will save (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank).
        The effects last for as long as the deity performs and for up to 1 round per divine rank thereafter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Affected creatures become blissfully calm. They are immune to fear and compulsion effects except for those
        created by deities of higher rank than the performing deity and any such effects already operating on affected
        creatures are countered and dispelled. This ability also counters and dispels rage effects except for those
        created by deities of higher rank than the performing deity. Immunity to fear and compulsion last for as long as
        the deity performs and for up to 1 round per divine rank thereafter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Affected creatures fall asleep. This works like the <i>sleep</i> spell, except that any living creature can be
        affected. Creatures can resist this mind effect with Will saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the
        deity’s divine rank). Affected creatures sleep for up to 1 hour per divine rank or until awakened. The deity can
        end the effect at will.
      </li>
      <li>
        Affected creatures are so deeply moved that they simply die. Only living creatures with Hit Dice equal to or
        less than the deity’s divine rank are affected. Creatures can resist the effect with Fortitude saves (DC 10 +
        the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once a creature makes a successful save against one of the deity’s performances, the creature cannot be affected
      again for one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Not all deities with this ability can create all the mentioned effects, as specified in the deity
      descriptions.

    <h2 id="know-death">Know Death</h2>
    <p>

      by looking at the creature.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death.</p>
    <h2 id="know-secrets">Know Secrets</h2>
    <p>No secrets can be kept from the deity.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can learn a creature’s entire history (including any embarrassing or vital
      secrets it might know) just by looking at it. This ability is similar to the <i>legend lore</i> spell, except that
      it delivers instant results and the subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the
      deity’s divine rank) to avoid the effect.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Knowledge, secrets.</p>
    <h2 id="lay-curse">Lay Curse</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability works like the <i>bestow curse</i> spell, except that mortals get no save.
      Deities of equal or lesser rank are subject to this ability, but are allowed Will saves (DC 10 + the deity’s
      Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank) to resist. The curse
    </p>
    <p>can be removed only by a deity of equal or higher rank than the cursing deity.</p>
    <p>
      The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must
      be within the deity’s line of sight when first affected.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Evil.</p>
    <h2 id="lay-quest">Lay Quest</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability works like the <i>geas/quest</i> spell, except that it works only on
      mortals and it can be removed only by a deity of equal or higher rank than the deity who lays the quest. The deity
      can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within
      the deity’s line of sight when first affected.

    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Gift of Life or Hand of Death salient divine ability.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity designates any mortal and snuffs out its life. Or the deity can designate any
      dead mortal and restore it to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> This ability works across planar boundaries and penetrates any barrier except a divine
      shield. However, the subject must be in a location the deity can sense, either within the deity’s sense range or
      in a location the deity can perceive through its remote sensing ability. If the deity cannot see the subject, the
      deity must unambiguously identify the subject in some fashion. If the deity chooses to kill a mortal, the ability
      works like the
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>destruction</i> spell, except that there is no material component or saving throw. The mortal cannot be raised
      or resurrected afterward, except by a deity of equal or higher rank using the Gift of Life or Life and Death
      salient divine ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the deity restores life to a mortal, this ability works like the
      <i>true resurrection</i> spell, except that there is no material component and the amount of time the subject has
      been dead is irrelevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ability cannot restore a creature to life against its will, but it can resurrect an elemental or outsider. It
      can resurrect a creature whose soul is trapped, provided the soul is not held by a deity of higher rank than the
      one using this ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ability cannot restore life to a creature that has been slain by the Hand of Death, Life and Death, or Mass
      Life and Death ability of a deity with a higher rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rest:</strong> After using either version of this ability, the deity must rest for 1 minute per level or
      Hit Die of the creature affected.

    <h2 id="life-drain">Life Drain</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death domain.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> As a free action, the deity can generate a cloud of darkness that rises from its body in
      a spread with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank and 10 feet high. The cloud blocks sight as a
      <i>deeper darkness</i> spell does, except that it cannot be countered by light
    </p>
    <p>
      effects (other than those cast by deities of higher rank). Living creatures must make Will saves (DC 10 + the
      deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank) or die. Even with a successful save, living creatures still
      gain two negative levels (the save DC to remove the negative levels is the same as the first Will save). A single
      creature can be drained by the cloud only once per day, but the cloud’s darkness remains effective.

    <h2 id="mass-divine-blast">Mass Divine Blast</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Cha 29, Divine Blast salient divine ability.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability works like the Divine Blast ability, except that the deity can specify up
      to five targets per rank, no two of which can be more than one mile apart per rank, or an area. The area can be a
      cone, burst, spread, or cylinder. A cone can be up to 100 feet long per rank. A burst or spread can have a radius
      of up to 50 feet per rank. A cylinder can have a radius of up to 50 feet per rank and a height of up to 10 feet
      per rank. The deity chooses the attack’s exact form and dimensions.

    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can designate any number of mortals and snuffs out their lives. Or the deity
      can designate any number of dead mortals and restore them to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> No two mortals affected by a single use of this ability can be more than one mile apart
      per rank of the deity. The ability is otherwise identical with the Life and Death salient divine ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rest:</strong> After using either version of this ability, the deity must rest for 1 minute per levels or
      Hit Dice of the creatures affected.

    <h2 id="master-crafter">Master Crafter</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 23 ranks in two different Craft skills.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Any object the deity creates is treated as a masterwork item, but uses the base item
      price (not the masterwork price) to determine time and cost required to create it. Any item the deity creates also
      has twice the hit points it would normally have, and its
    </p>
    <p>
      break DC is increased by +10. These benefits apply to walls, doors, and other components of buildings the deity
      creates, as well as smaller items.

    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Crafts, creation.</p>
    <h2 id="mind-of-the-beast">Mind of the Beast</h2>
    <p>The deity can make plants and animals sentient, and it can reduce sentient creatures to animal or plant form.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can grant humanlike sentience to trees or animals. This sentience lasts a
      maximum of one day, and the sentient tree or animal obeys the deity’s commands to the best of its ability. The
      deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be
      within the deity’s line of sight when first affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the deity can transmute any creature into a plant or animal of approximately the same size or up to two size
      categories smaller. The subject is allowed a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s
      divine rank) to resist. Subjects
    </p>
    <p>
      turned into plants become objects. Subjects turned into animals have the same abilities and statistics of the kind
      of animal the deity chooses.

    <h2 id="possess-mortal">Possess Mortal</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Cha 29.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can possess any mortal in any location the deity can sense. Unwilling mortals
      can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma modifier + the deity’s rank).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> Spells that prevent possession block this ability if the mortal is unwilling. Likewise,
      spells that end possession drive out the deity if the mortal is unwilling. If the mortal is willing, however, the
      deity cannot be blocked or driven out, except by a divine
    </p>
    <p>shield or the use of the Alter Reality salient divine ability by a deity of higher rank.</p>
    <p>
      The possessed mortal effectively becomes an avatar of the deity. The deity can draw on all the possessed mortal’s
      memories, and the deity senses what the mortal senses. Each mortal possessed counts as a remote location where the
      deity is sensing and communicating. A demigod can possess up to two mortals at a time, a lesser deity can possess
      up to five mortals at once, an intermediate deity can possess up to ten, and a greater deity can possess up to
      twenty mortals at once.
    </p>
    <p>While the deity is in possession, the mortal’s abilities are unchanged, except as noted below.</p>
    <p><em>Type:</em> Same as the deity.</p>
    <p><em>Hit Points:</em> Same as the mortal, +1 for each rank of the deity.</p>
    <p><em>Armor Class:</em> The mortal gains a divine bonus to Armor Class equal to half the deity’s divine rank.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Ability Scores:</em> Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution are unchanged. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
      become 5 points lower than the deity’s (or remain as the mortal’s scores if they are higher).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Saves:</em> Fortitude and Reflex same as the mortal; Will adjusted if necessary for the mortal’s new Wisdom
      score.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Skills:</em> The mortal can use its own skills and the deity’s skills. If the mortal and the deity have the
      same skill, use the skill of whichever has more ranks in the skill. Use the mortal’s effective ability scores to
      determine skill modifiers.

      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can give creatures good or bad fortune. The deity can affect up to one
      creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity’s line of
      sight when first affected. Subjects receive a luck bonus of +1 per divine rank or a luck penalty of –1 per divine
      rank on attack rolls, saves, and checks for one day. Any creature that attacks the deity automatically suffers the

    <p>
      These effects last as long as the deity concentrates and for up to 1 minute per divine rank afterward. The deity
      can end an effect as a free action.

    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Nature, sea, weather.</p>
    <h2 id="power-of-truth">Power of Truth</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity knows when anyone (other than a deity of equal or higher rank) deliberately
      lies. This ability works like the <i>discern lies</i> spell, except that it works continuously and applies to any
      creature the deity can perceive. The deity also can enchant creatures so they become truthful. The deity can
      affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the
      deity’s line of sight when first affected. The enchanted creatures become unable to utter any deliberate
      falsehoods or evasions of truth for one day. The subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity’s Charisma
      modifier + the deity’s divine rank) to resist. Subjects who make successful saves become immune to this ability
      for one day.

    <h2 id="rejuvenation">Rejuvenation</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 11, Divine Fast Healing salient divine ability.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When the deity suffers an attack that should destroy it, it simply disperses and
      reassembles later. Roll 10d10 to determine the number of days before the deity returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> If the deity is killed in its own realm, subtract the deity’s divine rank from the number
      of days it takes to return. If the deity’s realm is on a divinely morphic Outer Plane, and the deity is killed
      there, subtract twice the deity’s divine rank from
    </p>
    <p>the number of days it takes to return. The return always takes at least one day.</p>
    <p>This ability is ineffective if the deity is killed by another deity of equal or higher rank.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death, life, undead.</p>
    <h2 id="see-magic">See Magic</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Magic domain.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability is similar to a constant <i>greater arcane sight</i> spell, except that it
      covers the whole area the deity can see, and the deity immediately knows the number of auras present along with
      their locations and strengths. The deity needs to make a Spellcraft check to identify the school of each aura, but
      most deities with this ability can use Spellcraft as a free action.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Magic.</p>
    <h2 id="shapechange">Shapechange</h2>
    <p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 11, Alter Size salient divine ability,</p>
    <p>Alter Form salient divine ability.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can assume the form of an animal, beast, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical
      beast, monstrous humanoid, or plant. The assumed form must be both living and corporeal. The deity can remain in
      the assumed form indefinitely, but it resumes its own form if slain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> This ability works like the Shift Form salient divine ability, except that the deity is
      not limited to a set number of forms and as noted here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously with this one to become as small as a grain of sand or as
      large as 1,600 feet in the assumed form’s greatest dimension.
    </p>
    <p>The deity can use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +20 on its Disguise checks.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Nature, secrets, thieves.</p>
    <h2 id="shift-form">Shift Form</h2>
    <p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Alter Size salient divine ability, Alter Form salient divine
      ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can assume the form of another creature. The forms a deity can assume are
      limited and vary with each deity. The forms allowed are listed in the deity’s description. The deity can remain in
      the assumed form indefinitely, but it resumes its own form if slain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> The deity acquires the physical, natural, and extraordinary abilities of the form it has
      assumed (but not spell-like or supernatural abilities) while retaining its own mind. Physical abilities include
      natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Natural abilities include armor, natural weapons
      (such as claws, bite, swoop and rake, and constriction; but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain,
      energy effect, and the like), and similar gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of
      extremities, and so on). A body with extra limbs does not allow the deity to make more attacks (or more
      advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, such
      as walking, swimming, and flight with wings. The deity’s speed is that of the assumed form or the deity’s normal
      speed, whichever is higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its original
      form. However, if the assumed form has an extraordinary ability that allows it to produce a substance or shed part
      of its body, then this ability also grants that ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change
      in its Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and
      Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses.) The deity retains its outsider type, extraordinary
      abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not its supernatural abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity also retains its divine Armor Class bonus and divine qualities and abilities, provided they are not
      supernatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity can cast spells for which it has components. It needs a voice like that of a humanoid for verbal
      components and hands like those of a humanoid for somatic components, Likewise, the deity needs hands to use many
      of its powers, such as creating objects related to its portfolio.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the shape shift occurs, the deity’s equipment, if any, transforms to match the new form. If the new form is a
      creature that does not use equipment (aberration, animal, beast, magical beast, construct, dragon, elemental,
      ooze, some outsiders, plant, some undead creatures, some shapechangers, or vermin), the equipment melds into the
      new form and becomes nonfunctional.
    </p>
    <p>
      Material components and focuses melded in this way cannot be used to cast spells. If the new form uses equipment
      (fey, giant, humanoid, some outsiders, many shapechangers, many undead creatures), the deity’s equipment changes
      to match the new form and retains its properties.
    </p>
    <p>This ability cannot confer class levels or class abilities.</p>
    <p>
      The deity can change physical qualities such as hair color, hair texture, skin color, and gender. The deity can
      use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +15 on its Disguise checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously with this one to become as small as a grain of sand or as
      large as 1,600 feet in the assumed form’s greatest dimension.

    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Nature.</p>
    <h2 id="speak-with-creatures">Speak with Creatures</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity has the supernatural ability to converse with the specified creature. This
      ability works like a permanent <i>speak with animals</i> or <i>speak with plants</i> spell, or like a
      <i>tongues</i> spell that only allows the deity to converse with the specified type of creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different type of creature each
      time.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Nature.</p>
    <h2 id="spontaneous-wizard-spells">Spontaneous Wizard Spells</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Wizard level 1st, Int 29, Spell Mastery, Arcane Mastery salient
      divine ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability works like a cleric’s ability to cast <i>cure</i> spells spontaneously,
      except that it applies to wizard spells. The deity must have a sufficient Intelligence score and wizard levels to
      cast the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> The deity still needs a spellbook for its wizard spells unless it also has the Divine
      Spellcasting ability.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Knowledge, magic.</p>
    <h2 id="stride">Stride</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Travel domain.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity’s movement is doubled on the local or overland scales. Also, having this
      ability means that the deity’s height does not limit the distance it can jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the deity can impart extra overland speed to living creatures. The deity can affect up to one
      creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity’s line of
      sight when first affected. Creatures who receive this boon double their speeds on the local or overland scales.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Travel.</p>
    <h2 id="sunder-and-disjoin">Sunder and Disjoin</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> If any weapon or item is used against the deity in combat, the deity can destroy it with
      a touch. Treat a successful touch as a combination of a <i>disintegrate</i> spell and a
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>disjunction</i> spell, both targeted exclusively at the touched item. The save DC for both effects is 19 + the
      deity’s Charisma modifier. Anitem remains vulnerable to this ability for up to one day after being used against
      the deity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Victory, war.</p>
    <h2 id="supreme-initiative">Supreme Initiative</h2>
    <p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 29, Improved Initiative.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity goes first in the initiative order, no matter what its initiative result is or
      what initiative result anyone else in an encounter or battle has.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> Determine initiative normally among any beings who don’t have this ability, placing them
      in order after the deity. The deity can choose to delay or ready an action, just any other being can, and doing so
      changes the deity’s initiative as normal. The deity also can refocus, thereby resuming its position at the
      beginning of the initiative order.
    </p>
    <p>
      If two or more deities who have this ability are in the same battle, the deity with the highest divine rank gets
      the first position in the initiative order, the deity with the second highest rank gets the second position, and
      so on. Other beings then go in order after the last deity with the Supreme Initiative ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      If two deities with this ability and the same divine rank are in a battle, make an initiative check for each
      deity, and the deity with the higher result goes first.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Agility, thieves, war.</p>
    <h2 id="true-knowledge">True Knowledge</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 11, Int 40, bardic knowledge or lore class feature and 10th level in
      the class that grants the ability, Knowledge domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity never fails a bardic knowledge or lore check, no matter how obscure the
      knowledge involved. The deity speaks and understands all languages. The deity can use <i>legend lore</i> and
      <i>analyze dweomer</i> as free actions at will. These actions count against
    </p>
    <p>the deity’s maximum number of free actions per round.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Knowledge.</p>
    <h2 id="true-shapechange">True Shapechange</h2>
    <p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 16, Alter Size salient divine ability, Alter Form salient divine
      ability, Shapechange salient divine ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can assume the form of any object or creature. The deity can remain in the
      assumed form indefinitely, but it resumes its own form if slain.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This ability works like the Shift Form salient divine ability, except as noted below.</p>
    <p>
      The deity can take any form, living or unliving, corporal or incorporeal. The deity gains the supernatural
      abilities of the assumed form.
    </p>
    <p>The deity can use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +20 on its Disguise checks.</p>
    <p>
      The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously with this one to become as small as a grain of sand or as
      large as 1,600 feet in the assumed form’s greatest dimension.

    <h2 id="undead-mastery">Undead Mastery</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 14, Cleric level 17th.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can automatically command or destroy any undead creature, as desired, as a
      free action, though this counts against the normal limit of free actions per round. The deity can do this as often
      as desired, but it can command no more than one
    </p>
    <p>undead creature per divine rank (regardless of the creatures’ Hit Dice) at any one time.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death, life, undead.</p>
    <h2 id="undead-qualities">Undead Qualities</h2>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity gains the qualities of the undead type:</p>
    <p>—No Constitution score.</p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>—Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).</p>
    <p>—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, and death effects.</p>
    <p>
      —Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Immune to damage to its physical
      ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), as well as to fatigue and exhaustion effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Cannot heal damage on its own if it has no Intelligence score, although it can be healed. Negative energy can
      heal undead creatures. The fast healing special quality works regardless of the creature’s Intelligence score.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless).
    </p>
    <p>—Uses its Charisma modifier for Concentration checks.</p>
    <p>
      —Not at risk of death from massive damage, but when reduced to 0 hit points or less, it is immediately destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Not affected by <i>raise dead</i> and <i>reincarnate</i> spells or abilities. <i>Resurrection</i> and
      <i>true resurrection</i> can affect undead creatures. These spells turn undead creatures back into the living
      creatures they were before becoming undead.
    </p>
    <p>—Undead do not breathe, eat, or sleep.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death, undead.</p>
    <h2 id="wave-of-chaos">Wave of Chaos</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Chaotic alignment.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can create a wave of mental force that extends from the deity in a spread with
      a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. Creatures within the spread must make Will saves (DC 10 + the deity’s
      Charisma modifier + the deity’s divine rank) or
    </p>
    <p>
      be forced to act unpredictably. This ability works like a
      <i>confusion</i> spell cast by a sorcerer of level 10 + the deity’s divine rank.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Chaos.</p>
    <h2 id="wound-enemy">Wound Enemy</h2>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Base attack bonus +20.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The affected weapon deals damage to a creature such that a wound it causes deals 1d6
      points of damage per round thereafter in addition to the normal damage from the weapon. Multiple wounds from the
      weapon result in cumulative bleeding loss (two
    </p>
    <p>
      wounds for 2d6 points of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can only be stopped by a successful Heal check
      (DC 15 + the deity’s rank) or the application of any <i>cure</i> spell or other healing spell
      <i>(heal, healing circle,</i> and so on).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Notes:</strong> The ability functions only when the deity personally attacks with a physical weapon. The
      ability works with a ranged weapon, but not if someone else uses the weapon. The deity can apply to the ability to
      any weapon or natural weapon, but not to a
    </p>
    <p>
      spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or divine ability. A deity can have this ability multiple times,
      and its effects stack.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death, pain, war.</p>
    <h2 id="feats">Feats</h2>
    <p>Deities can obtain the feats described here, in addition to any standard feats.</p>
    <h3 id="blindsight-5-ftradius">Blindsight,5-Ft.Radius<small> [General]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Base attack bonus +4, Blind-Fight, Wisdom 19.</p>
    <p>
      Benefit: Using senses such as acute hearing and sensitivity to vibrations, you detect the location of opponents
      who are no more than 5 feet away from you. <i>Invisibility</i> and <i>darkness</i> are irrelevant, though it you
      discern incorporeal beings.
    </p>
    <h3 id="disguise-spell">Disguise Spell<small> [Metamagic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Bardic music, Perform 12 ranks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> You have mastered the art of casting spells unobtrusively, mingling verbal and somatic
      components into its music and performances so that others rarely catch you in the act of casting a spell. Like a
      silent, stilled spell, a disguised spell can’t be identified through Spellcraft. Your performance is obvious to
      everyone in the vicinity, but the fact that you are casting a spell isn’t. Unless the spell visibly emanates from
      you or observers have some other means of determining its source, they don’t know where the effect came from. A
      disguised spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.
    </p>
    <h3 id="divine-might">Divine Might<small> [Divine ]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Str 13, turn or rebuke undead ability, Power Attack.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> As a free action, spend one of your turn or rebuke undead attempts to add your Charisma
      bonus to your weapon damage for 1 full round.
    </p>
    <h3 id="divine-vengeance">Divine Vengeance<small> [Divine ]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ability to turn undead, Extra Turning.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> You can spend one of your turn undead attempts to add 2d6 points of sacred energy damage
      to all your successful melee attacks against undead until the end of your next action. This is a supernatural
      ability.
    </p>
    <h3 id="energy-substitution">Energy Substitution<small> [Metamagic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Any other metamagic feat, Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> You choose one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. When employing a
      spell with the acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic designator, you can modify the spell to use your chosen
      type of energy instead. The altered spell uses a spell slot of the spell’s normal level.
    </p>
    <p>The altered spell works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealt.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time the feat applies to a different type of
      energy.
    </p>
    <h3 id="extra-music">Extra Music <small>[General]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Bardic music.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can use your bardic music four extra times per day.</p>
    <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Bards without the Extra Music feat can use bardic music once per day per level.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> You can gain this feat multiple times, adding another four uses of bardic music each
      time.
    </p>
    <h3 id="eyes-in-the-back-of-your-head">Eyes in the Back of Your Head<small> [General]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Base attack bonus +3, Wis 19.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Attackers do not gain the usual +2 attack bonus when flanking you. This feat grants no
      effect whenever you are attacked without benefit of your Dexterity modifier to AC, such as when you are
      flat-footed or when you are the target of a rogue’s sneak attack.
    </p>
    <h3 id="fleet-of-foot">Fleet of Foot<small> [General]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 15, Run.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When running or charging, you can make a single direction change of 90 degrees or less.
      You can’t use this feat while wearing medium or heavy armor, or when carrying a medium or heavy load. If you are
      charging, you must move in a straight line for 10 feet after the turn to maintain the charge.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, you can run or charge only in a straight line.</p>
    <h3 id="hold-the-line">Hold the Line <small>[General]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Combat Reflexes, base attack bonus +2.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> You may make an attack of opportunity against a chagin opponent who enters an atea you
      threaten. Your attack of opportunity happens immediately before the charge attack is resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Normal:</strong> You only get an attack of opportunity against a character that exits a square you
      threaten.
    </p>
    <h3 id="jack-of-all-trades">Jack of All Trades<small> [General]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> You must be at least 6th level.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can use any skill untrained, even those that normally require training.</p>
    <h3 id="knock-down">Knock-Down<small> [General]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Base attack bonus +2, Improved Trip, Str 15.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you deal 10 or more points of damage to your opponent in melee, you make a trip
      attack as a free action against the same target.
    </p>
    <h3 id="persistent-spell">Persistent Spell<small> [Metamagic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Extend Spell.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> A persistent spell has a duration of 24 hours. The persistent spell must have a personal
      range or a fixed range. Spells of instantaneous duration cannot be affected by this feat, nor can spells whose
      effects are discharged. You need not concentrate on spells such as <i>detect magic</i> or
      <i>detect thoughts</i> to be aware of the mere presence of absence of the things detected, but you must still
      concentrate to gain additional information as normal. Concentration on such a spell is a standard action that does
      not provoke an attack of opportunity. A persistent spell uses up a spell slot six levels higher than the spell’s
      actual level.
    </p>
    <h3 id="plant-control">Plant Control <small>[General]</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Plant Defiance, ability to cast
      <i>speak with plants.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> You can rebuke or command plant creatures as an evil cleric rebukes undead. To command a
      plant, you must be able to speak with it via a <i>speak with plants</i> effect, though it may do so mentally if
      desired. This ability is usable a total number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You use your
      highest caster level to determine the level at which you rebuke plants.
    </p>
    <h3 id="plant-defiance">Plant Defiance<small> [General]</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Ability to cast
      <i>detect animals or plants.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> You can turn (but not destroy) plant creatures as a good cleric turns undead. When
      determining the result of a turning attempt, treat all destruction results as normal turning. Treat immobile plant
      creatures as creatures unable to flee. This ability is usable a total number of times per day equal to 3 + your
      Charisma modifier. You use your highest caster level to determine the level at which you turns plants.

    <h3 id="power-critical">Power Critical<small> [General]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Weapon focus (chosen weapon), base attack bonus +4</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When using the weapon you selected, you gain a +4 bonus on the roll to confirm a threat.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Power Critical as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
    <p>
      You can gain Power Critical multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it may be with a different weapon or the
      same weapon. If you take it with the same weapon, the effects of the feats stack.
    </p>
    <h3 id="reach-spell">Reach Spell<small> [Metamagic]</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> You may cast a spell that normally has a range of touch at any distance up to 30 feet.
      The spell effectively becomes a ray, so you must succeed at a ranged touch attack to bestow the spell upon the
      recipient. A reach spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual level.
    </p>
    <h3 id="repeat-spell">Repeat Spell<small> [Metamagic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Any other metamagic feat.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> A repeated spell is automatically cast again at the beginning of your next round of
      actions. No matter where you are, the secondary spell originates from the same location and affects the same area
      as the primary spell. If the repeated spell
    </p>
    <p>
      designates a target, the secondary spell retargets the same target if the target is within 30 feet of its original
      position; otherwise the secondary spell fails to go off. A repeated spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher
      than the spell’s actual level. Repeat Spell cannot be used on spells with a range of touch.
    </p>
    <h3 id="sacred-spell">Sacred Spell<small> [Metamagic]</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Half of the damage dealt by a sacred spell results directly from divine power and is
      therefore not subject to being reduced by protection from elements or similar magic. The other half of the damage
      dealt by the spell is as normal. A sacred spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual
      level. Only divine spells can be cast as sacred spells.
    </p>
    <h3 id="sharp-shooting">Sharp-Shooting<small> [General]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, base attack bonus +3.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Your targets only receive a +2 bonus to Armor class due to cover. This feat has no
      effect against foes with no cover or total cover.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Cover normally gives a +4 bonus to AC.</p>
    <p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Sharp-Shooting as one of his bonus feats.</p>
    <h3 id="subdual-substitution">Subdual Substitution<small> [Metamagic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Any other metamagic feat, Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When employing a spell with the acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic designator, you
      can modify the spell to deal subdual damage instead of the indicated type of energy damage. The altered spell uses
      a spell slot of the spell’s normal level.
    </p>
    <p>The altered spell works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealt.</p>
    <h3 id="superior-expertise">Superior Expertise<small> [General]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Int 13, Combat Expertise, base attack bonus +6.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When you use the Combat Expertise feat to improve your Armor Class, the number you
      subtract from your attack and add to your AC can be any number that does not exceed your base attack bonus.
    </p>
    <p>This feat eliminates the +5 maximum for the Combat Expertise feat.</p>
