      <h3 id="section-0-1">Mage Armor</h3>

      <p>Conjuration (Creation) [Force]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 1</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, F</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> Creature touched</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates (harmless)</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a <i>mage armor </i>spell, providing a +4
        armor bonus to AC.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike mundane armor, <i>mage armor </i>entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed
        reduction. Since <i>mage armor </i>is made of force, incorporeal creatures can’t bypass it the way they do
        normal armor.
      </p>

      <p><i>Focus: </i>A piece of cured leather.</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-2">Mage Hand</h3>

      <p>Transmutation</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Brd 0, Sor/Wiz 0</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One nonmagical, unattended object weighing up to 5 lb.</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        You point your finger at an object and can lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, you
        can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and
        the object ever exceeds the spell’s range.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-3">Mage’s Disjunction</h3>

      <p>Abjuration</p>

      <p><b>Level: </b>Magic 9, Sor/Wiz 9</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> All magical effects and magic items within a 40-ft.-radius burst</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates (object)</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch,
        are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the
        effect as a <i>dispel magic </i>spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or
        be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature’s possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor’s
        Will save bonus, whichever is higher.
      </p>

      <p>
        You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an <i>antimagic field. </i>If the
        <i>antimagic field </i>survives the <i>disjunction, </i>no items within it are disjoined.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even artifacts are subject to <i>disjunction, </i>though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually
        affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or
        permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. (These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even
        <i>miracle </i>or <i>wish</i>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Note: </i>Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some
        powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-4">Mage’s Faithful Hound</h3>

      <p>Conjuration (Creation)</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Effect:</b> Phantom watchdog</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/caster level or until discharged, then 1 round/caster level; see text</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it
        was conjured (it does not move). The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature
        approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the
        area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures.
        It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10
        attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of piercing damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an
        invisible creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder’s turn. Its bite is
        the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can
        be dispelled.
      </p>

      <p>
        The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster
        level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends.
      </p>

      <p><i>Material Component: </i>A tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread.</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-5">Mage’s Lucubration</h3>

      <p>Transmutation</p>

      <p><b>Level: </b>Wiz 6</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Personal</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> You</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p>
        You instantly recall any one spell of 5th level or lower that you have used during the past 24 hours. The spell
        must have been actually cast during that period. The recalled spell is stored in your mind as through prepared
        in the normal fashion.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the recalled spell requires material components, you must provide them. The recovered spell is not usable
        until the material components are available.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-6">Mage’s Magnificent Mansion</h3>

      <p>Conjuration (Creation)</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 7</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, F</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Effect:</b> Extradimensional mansion, up to three 10-ft. cubes/level (S)</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 2 hours/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was
        cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those
        you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You
        may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a
        magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell’s effect. The place is furnished and contains
        sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of
        near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The
        servants function as <i>unseen servant </i>spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the
        mansion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion,
        nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Focus: </i>A miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon
        (each item worth 5 gp).
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-7">Mage’s Private Sanctum</h3>

      <p>Abjuration</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> 30-ft. cube/level (S)</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 24 hours (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the area from outside sees only a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision
        cannot penetrate it. No sounds, no matter how loud, can escape the area, so nobody can eavesdrop from outside.
        Those inside can see out normally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Divination (scrying) spells cannot perceive anything within the area, and those within are immune to
        <i>detect thoughts</i>. The ward prevents speech between those inside and those outside (because it blocks
        sound), but it does not prevent other communication, such as a <i>sending </i>or <i>message </i>spell, or
        telepathic communication, such as that between a wizard and her familiar.
      </p>

      <p>The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area.</p>

      <p><i>Mage’s private sanctum </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Material Component: </i>A thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered
        chrysolite.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-8">Mage’s Sword</h3>

      <p>Evocation [Force]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 7</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, F</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Effect:</b> One sword</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        This spell brings into being a shimmering, swordlike plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within
        its range, as you desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target
        once each round on your turn. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Int bonus or your Cha bonus
        (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can
        strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19–20
        and a critical multiplier of x2.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one.
        If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it,
        the sword returns to you and hovers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target. If you do not,
        the sword continues to attack the previous round’s target.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a
        <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation </i>affects it. The sword’s AC is 13 (10, +0 size
        bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus).
      </p>

      <p>
        If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time
        <i>Mage’s sword </i>strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword
        has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Focus: </i>A miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc. It costs 250 gp to
        construct.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-9">Magic Aura</h3>

      <p>Illusion (Glamer)</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Brd 1, Magic 1, Sor/Wiz 1</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, F</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One touched object weighing up</p>

      <p>to 5 lb./level</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> One day/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None; see text</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        You alter an item’s aura so that it registers to <i>detect </i>spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as
        though it were nonmagical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the object bearing <i>magic aura </i>has <i>identify </i>cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner
        recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object’s actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save.
        Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the targeted item’s own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance),
        <i>magic aura </i>doesn’t work.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Note: </i>A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for
        example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.
      </p>

      <p><i>Focus: </i>A small square of silk that must be passed over the object that receives the aura.</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-10">Magic Circle against Chaos</h3>

      <p>Abjuration [Lawful]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Clr 3, Law 3, Pal 3, Sor/Wiz 3</p>

      <p>
        This spell functions like <i>magic circle against evil, </i>except that it is similar to
        <i>protection from chaos </i>instead of <i>protection from evil</i>, and it can imprison a nonlawful called
        creature.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-11">Magic Circle against Evil</h3>

      <p>Abjuration [Good]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Clr 3, Good 3, Pal 3, Sor/Wiz 3</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M/DF</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> 10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 10 min./level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates (harmless)</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No; see text</p>

      <p>
        All creatures within the area gain the effects of a <i>protection from evil </i>spell, and no nongood summoned
        creatures can enter the area either. You must overcome a creature’s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay
        (as in the third function of <i>protection from evil</i>), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the
        protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies’ spell resistance.
      </p>

      <p>
        This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A
        <i>magic circle against evil </i>can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds
        a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser planar binding, planar binding, </i>and
        <i>greater planar binding </i>spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the
        spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the
        circle’s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell’s area is the subject of the spell, the spell
        acts as a normal <i>protection from evil </i>spell for that creature only.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <i>magic circle </i>leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the
        process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that
        disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell
        resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks
        free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i
          >astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, </i
        >and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature’s
        extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor </i>spell on it, but you must cast the spell before
        the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor </i>effect lasts as long as the
        <i>magic circle </i>does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle, </i>but its ranged attacks
        (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach
        with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented
        with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle </i>more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10
        minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the
        diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to
        complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and
        20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.
      </p>

      <p>
        A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor </i>spell on the <i>magic circle </i>during the
        round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor </i>holds any called creatures in the
        <i>magic circle </i>for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a
        <i>magic circle </i>prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the
        creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding </i>spell), the DC
        increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across
        it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.
      </p>

      <p>This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from evil </i>and vice versa.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Arcane Material Component: </i>A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-footdiameter circle on the
        floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.

        <i>Magic fang </i>gives one natural weapon of the subject a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The

      <h3 id="section-0-16">Magic Jar</h3>

      <p>Necromancy</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, F</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One creature</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level or until you return to your body</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates; see text</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        By casting <i>magic jar, </i>you place your soul in a gem or large crystal (known as the <i>magic jar</i>),
        leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the
        <i>magic jar. </i>You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to
        possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle
        empty.
      </p>

      <p>
        To cast the spell, the <i>magic jar </i>must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do
        not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near
        as anyone can tell, dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        While in the <i>magic jar, </i>you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on
        the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the
        exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4
        or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive
        or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or
        are, souls.)
      </p>

      <p>
        You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker
        creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by <i>protection from evil </i>or a similar
        ward. You possess the body and force the creature’s soul into the <i>magic jar </i>unless the subject succeeds
        on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the <i>magic jar, </i>and the target
        automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host’s life force is imprisoned in the
        <i>magic jar. </i>You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save
        bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points,
        natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or
        more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can’t choose to activate the body’s extraordinary or
        supernatural abilities. The creature’s spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the <i>magic jar </i>if within range, sending the
        trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the host body is slain, you return to the <i>magic jar, </i>if within range, and the life force of the host
        departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any
        life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the spell ends while you are in the <i>magic jar, </i>you return to your body (or die if your body is out of
        range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of
        range of your current position), and the soul in the <i>magic jar </i>returns to its body (or dies if it is out
        of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the
        <i>magic jar </i>or at the host’s location.
      </p>

      <p><i>Focus: </i>A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp.</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of
        force damage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat or has less than total cover or total
        concealment. Specific parts of a creature can’t be singled out. Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile—two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at
        7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them
        strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate
        targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.

      <h3 id="section-0-18">Magic Mouth</h3>

      <p>Illusion (Glamer)</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 2</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One creature or object</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Permanent until discharged</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates (object)</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (object)</p>

      <p>
        This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its
        message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can
        be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal
        components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words
        articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course,
        <i>magic mouth </i>can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.
      </p>

      <p>
        The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell.
        Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used.
        Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not
        defeat a visual trigger, but magical <i>darkness </i>or <i>invisibility </i>does. Silent movement or magical
        <i>silence </i>defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a
        specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A
        <i>magic mouth </i>cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.
      </p>

      <p>
        The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a
        <i>magic mouth </i>to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond
        only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.
      </p>

      <p><i>Magic mouth </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell.</p>

      <p>
        You transmute as many as three pebbles, which can be no larger than sling bullets, so that they strike with
        great force when thrown or slung. If hurled, they have a range increment of 20 feet. If slung, treat them as
        sling bullets (range increment 50 feet). The spell gives them a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls.
        The user of the stones makes a normal ranged attack<i>. </i>Each stone that hits deals 1d6+1 points of damage
        (including the spell’s enhancement bonus), or 2d6+2 points against undead.

      </p>

      <p>
        You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see <i>magic fang</i>). A

        Alternatively, you can affect as many as fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same

        abilities of a broken magic item made whole, and it cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands. The spell

      <p>
        You draw an indelible mark on the subject and state some behavior on the part of the subject that will activate
        the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject. Typically, you designate some sort of criminal behavior
        that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the
        effect of <i>bestow curse</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you can cast it only on a creature
        that is willing or restrained.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like the effect of <i>bestow curse</i>, a <i>mark of justice </i>cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with
        a <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or <i>wish </i>spell.
        <i>Remove curse </i>works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than your <i>mark of justice </i>caster
        level. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the mark has activated.

        You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth of force planes. Each round on its turn, it may
        attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn’t
        escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, forcing the subject to leave.
      </p>

      <p>
        On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the <i>maze </i>spell was cast. If
        this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities
        that move a creature within a plane, such as <i>teleport </i>and <i>dimension door, </i>do not help a creature
        escape a <i>maze </i>spell, although a <i>plane shift </i>spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is
        designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 10 min./level</p>

      <p>
        <i>Meld into stone </i>enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone
        must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not
        more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails
        and is wasted.
      </p>

      <p>
        While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded.
        You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that
        goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to
        the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels
        you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone’s complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly

        <i>Transmute rock to mud </i>expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in

      <p>
        <i>Meteor swarm </i>is a very powerful and spectacular spell that is similar to <i>fireball </i>in many aspects.
        When you cast it, four 2- foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines
        to the spots you select. The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the
        meteor. Any creature struck by one of these spheres takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and
        receives no saving throw against the sphere’s fire damage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its target,
        it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target’s space. You may aim more than one meteor at the same
        target.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage
        to each creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately
        against each. (Fire resistance applies to each sphere’s damage individually.)

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p>
        You don’t so much cast a <i>miracle </i>as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request
        that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.
      </p>

      <p>A <i>miracle </i>can do any of the following things.</p>

      <p>
        • Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of your
        domains).
      </p>

      <p>• Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.</p>
      <p>• Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity.</p>
      <p>• Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.</p>

      <p>If the <i>miracle </i>has any of the above effects, casting it has no experience point cost.</p>

      <p>
        Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a <i>miracle </i>costs the cleric 5,000
        XP because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful <i>miracles </i>of this
        sort could include the following.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to
        a specific locale with no chance of error.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.
      </p>

      <p>In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity’s (or alignment’s) nature is refused.</p>

      <p>
        A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level
        spell. When a <i>miracle </i>duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost. When a
        <i>miracle </i>spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide
        that component.
      </p>

      <p><i>XP Cost: </i>5,000 XP (for some uses of the <i>miracle </i>spell; see above).</p>

        This spell functions like <i>hallucinatory terrain</i>, except that it enables you to make any area appear to be
        something other than it is. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements. Unlike
        <i>hallucinatory terrain, </i>the spell can alter the appearance of structures (or add them where none are
        present). Still, it can’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures (though creatures within the area might hide

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level (D)</p>

      <p>
        Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to
        attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Mirror image </i>creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total).
        These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or
        you. You can move into and through a <i>mirror image. </i>When you and the <i>mirror image </i>separate,
        observers can’t use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move
        through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink
        potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets.
        Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against
        an image destroys it. An image’s AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem to react
        normally to area spells (such as looking like they’re burned or dead after being hit by a <i>fireball</i>).
      </p>

      <p>
        While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is
        real are again confounded.
      </p>

      <p>
        An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her
        eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded.)

        By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras (<i
          >detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, </i
        >and the like). On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the
        subject of <i>misdirection </i>is detected as if it were the other object. (Neither the subject nor the other
        object gets a saving throw against this effect.) Detection spells provide information based on the second object
        rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save.
        For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying,
        not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (<i
          >augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, </i

      <p>
        You become invisible (as <i>improved invisibility</i>, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of
        you (as <i>major image, </i>a figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away.
        The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on
        the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so
        that observers don’t notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in
        different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot
        attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease
        concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The

        You reach into the subject’s mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell cannot negate charm, geas/quest,
        suggestion, or similar spells.
      </p>

      <p>• Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually experienced.</p>
      <p>• Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.</p>
      <p>• Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.</p>

      <p>
        Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as
        5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory time you want to modify) visualizing the memory you
        wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if
        the subject is ever beyond the spell’s range during this time, the spell is lost.
      </p>

      <p>
        A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject’s actions, particularly if it contradicts the
        creature’s natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream or a
        memory muddied by too much wine.

        This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself. Once during the spell’s duration, you may

        <i>moment of prescience </i>before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends.
      </p>

      <p>You can’t have more than one <i>moment of prescience </i>active on you at the same time.</p>

      <p>Conjuration (Summoning)</p>

      <p><b>Effect:</b> One mount</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 2 hours/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        You summon a light horse or a pony (your choice) to serve you as a mount. The steed serves willingly and well.
        The mount comes with a bit and bridle and a riding saddle.
      </p>

      <p><i>Material Component: </i>A bit of horse hair.</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-46">Move Earth</h3>

      <p>Transmutation [Earth]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Drd 6, Sor/Wiz 6</p>

      <p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> See text</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> Dirt in an area up to 750 ft. square and up to 10 ft. deep (S)</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p>
        <i>Move earth </i>moves dirt (clay, loam, sand), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting
        dunes, and so forth.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting
        time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by
        750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move.
      </p>

      <p>
        This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs,
        with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock
        formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.
      </p>

      <p>
        The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is
        for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle.
      </p>

      <p>This spell has no effect on earth creatures.</p>

      <p><i>Material Component: </i>A mixture of soils (clay, loam, and sand) in a small bag, and an iron blade.</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Brd 4, Clr 4, Drd 3, Pal 4, Rgr 3</p>

      <p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 10 min./level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates (harmless, object)</p>

      <p><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless, object)</p>

      <p>
        You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional
        effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous
        effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don’t go away on their own.
      </p>

      <p>
        The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the spell. Unlike with
        <i>delay poison</i>, such effects aren’t postponed until after the duration —the creature need not make any
        saves against poison effects applied to it during the length of the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object for the duration of the spell, at
        the caster’s option.
      </p>

      <p><i>Arcane Material Component: </i>A bit of charcoal.</p>

      <p>
        You send a hideous and unsettling phantasmal vision to a specific creature that you name or otherwise
        specifically designate.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>nightmare </i>prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The <i>nightmare </i>leaves the
        subject fatigued and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if
        any) you have to that creature.

        If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter
        a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the casting. If you
        are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst of
        casting a spell or the spell ends.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in
        the trance.

        The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as
        <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, </i>and <i>detect </i>spells. <i>Nondetection </i>also prevents
        location by such magic items as <i>crystal ball</i>s. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature
        or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of
        11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast <i>nondetection</i>. If you cast <i>nondetection </i>on
        yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.

        This spell hides an object from location by divination (scrying) effects, such as the <i>scrying </i>spell or a

        A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including
        darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures
        farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).
      </p>

      <p>
        A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a <i>gust of wind </i>spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong
        wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A <i>fireball, flame strike</i>, or similar spell burns away the
        fog in the explosive or fiery spell’s area. A <i>wall of fire </i>burns away the fog in the area into which it

        If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition,

      <p>
        The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to chaotic creatures (or 1d6 points of
        damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to chaotic outsiders) and causes them to be dazed for 1 round. A

        spell for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires
