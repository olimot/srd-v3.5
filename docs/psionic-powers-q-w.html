      <h1>PSIONIC POWERS (Q-W)</h1>

      <h3>Quintessence</h3>

      <p>Metacreativity (Creation)</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Shaper 4</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Material; see text</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 round</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> 0 ft.</p>

      <p><b>Effect:</b> 1-inch-diameter dollop of quintessence; see text</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 7</p>

      <p>
        You collapse a bit of time from the continuum, forming a 1-ounce dollop of thick, gooey material called
        quintessence. This substance shimmers like a silver mirror when viewed from some angles but is transparent from
        other viewpoints. You can smooth a dollop of quintessence around any extremely small object.
      </p>

      <p>
        Objects sealed within quintessence are protected from the effects of time; in practical terms, they enter a
        state of stasis. Living flesh with only partial contact with quintessence is also partially pulled out of the
        time stream (the manifester is immune to this effect). This disruption deals 1 point of damage per round
        beginning 10 rounds after partial contact occurs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quintessence can be manually scraped away from a protected object, freeing it to rejoin the time stream. When
        you do this, there is a 75% chance that the quintessence evaporates back into the continuum. Otherwise, it
        coalesces again into a 1-inch-diameter bead, available for later use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Large quantities of quintessence could theoretically be gathered to preserve large items or structures (or even
        a complete living creature; if completely immersed, a living creature would not take the damage associated with
        partial contact). However, psionic characters and creatures are generally loath to do so because accumulations
        of quintessence weighing 1 pound or more hinder psionic activity within a 5-foot radius of the accumulation:
        Powers require twice as many power points to manifest, unless the manifester makes a successful Will save each
        time he or she attempts to manifest a power. Also in these circumstances, manifesting a psi-like ability that is
        usable at will is a full-round action rather than a standard action.
      </p>

      <h3>Read Thoughts</h3>

      <p>Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Telepath 2</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Mental</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> 60 ft.</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> Cone-shaped emanation centered on you</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates; see text</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 3</p>

      <p>
        You know the surface thoughts of the mind of any creature in the area that fails a Will save. A target that
        succeeds on its save is not affected by this manifestation of the power, even if it leaves the area and then
        reenters the area before the duration expires.
      </p>

      <p>
        Creatures of animal intelligence have simple, instinctual thoughts that you can pick up. If you read the
        thoughts of a creature with an Intelligence of 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own
        Intelligence score), you are stunned for 1 round and the power ends. This power does not let you pinpoint the
        location of an affected mind if you don’t have line of sight to the subject.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each round, you can turn to use this power in a new area. The power can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone,
        1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
      </p>

      <h3>Reality Revision</h3>

      <p>Clairsentience</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 9</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> See text</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> See text</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 17, XP</p>

      <p>
        As <i>bend reality</i>, but with more farreaching effects. A <i>reality revision </i>can produce any one of the
        following effects.
      </p>

      <p>• Duplicate any psion power of 8th level or lower, provided the power is not prohibited to you.</p>

      <p>• Duplicate any other power (but not a spell) of 6th level or lower, such as a psychic warrior power.</p>

      <p>• Duplicate any psion power of 7th level or lower even if it’s a power prohibited to you.</p>

      <p>• Undo the harmful effects of many other powers, such as <i>microcosm, geas/quest, </i>or <i>insanity</i>.</p>

      <p>• Create a nonpsionic item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</p>

      <p>• Create a psionic item, or add to the powers of an existing psionic item (see XP cost below).</p>

      <p>
        • Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five <i>reality revisions </i>manifested in
        immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score. Inherent bonuses are
        instantaneous, so they cannot be negated or dispelled. An inherent bonus cannot exceed +5 for a single ability
        score. Inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack; only the best one applies.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Remove injuries and afflictions. A single <i>reality revision </i>can aid one creature per manifester level,
        and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Reality revision </i>can not restore the experience point loss from manifesting a power or casting a spell,
        or the level or&nbsp; Constitution loss from being returned to life by those effects that reduce level or
        Constitution.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Revive the dead. <i>Reality revision </i>can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a
        <i>resurrection </i>spell. This power can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task
        takes two manifestations of <i>reality revision</i>, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body
        with life again. <i>Reality revision </i>cannot prevent a character who is brought back to life from losing a
        level.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Transport travelers. This power can lift one creature per manifester level from anywhere on any plane and
        place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will
        save to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.
      </p>

      <p>
        • Undo misfortune. <i>Reality revision </i>can undo a single recent event. Manifesting the power forces a reroll
        of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the
        new result. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a
        Will save to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can try to use <i>reality revision </i>to produce more powerful effects than these, but doing so is
        dangerous. The manifestation may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a
        partial fulfillment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Duplicated powers allow saves and power resistance as normal (but save DCs are calculated as though the power is
        9th level).
      </p>

      <p><i>XP Cost: </i>The minimum XP cost for manifesting <i>reality revision </i>is 5,000</p>

      <p>
        XP. When a manifestation duplicates a power that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever
        is more. When a manifestation creates or improves a psionic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for
        crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.
      </p>

      <h3>Recall Agony</h3>

      <p>Clairsentience [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 2</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Material</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One creature</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will half</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 3</p>

      <p>
        The fabric of time parts to your will, revealing wounds your foe has received in the past (or has yet to
        receive). That foe takes 2d6 points of damage as the past (or future) impinges briefly on the present.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s damage increases by 1d6 points. For
        each extra 2d6 points of damage, this power’s save DC increases by 1.
      </p>

      <h3>Recall Death</h3>

      <p>Clairsentience [Death, Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 8</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will partial; see text</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 15</p>

      <p>
        As <i>recall agony</i>, except the wounds revealed by folding the fourth dimension are potentially fatal. If the
        target fails its Will save. it dies. If the save succeeds, the target instead takes 5d6 points of damage.
      </p>

      <h3>Reddopsi</h3>

      <p>Psychokinesis</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Kineticist 7</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Auditory, mental, and olfactory</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Personal</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> You</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Until discharged or 10 min./level</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 13</p>

      <p>
        When you manifest <i>reddopsi, </i>powers targeted against you rebound to affect the original manifester. This
        effect reverses powers that have only you as a target (except <i>dispel psionics </i>and similar powers or
        effects). Powers that affect an area and those that produce effects can’t be reversed. <i>Reddopsi </i>also
        can’t reverse any power with a range of touch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Should you rebound a power back against a manifester who also is protected by <i>reddopsi</i>, the power
        rebounds once more upon you.
      </p>

      <h3>Remote View Trap</h3>

      <p>Clairsentience [Electricity]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 6</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Mental and visual</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Personal</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> You</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 24 hours + 1 hour/level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will half; see text</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 11</p>

      <p>
        When others use <i>clairvoyant sense</i>, <i>remote viewing</i>, or other means of scrying you from afar, your
        prepared trap gives them a nasty surprise. If the scryer fails its saving throw, you are undetected. Moreover,
        the would-be observer takes 8d6 points of electricity damage. If the scryer makes its saving throw, it takes
        only 4d6 points of electricity damage and is able to observe you normally. Either way, you are aware of the
        attempt to view you, but not of the viewer or the viewer’s location. It is possible that you might recognize the
        quasireal viewpoint of someone using the <i>remote viewing </i>power if you could pierce its
        <i>invisibility </i>(which is true for <i>remote viewing </i>whether or not you use this power).
      </p>

      <h3>Remote Viewing</h3>

      <p>Clairsentience (Scrying; see text)</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Seer 4</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Mental</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 hour</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> See text</p>

      <p><b>Effect:</b> Quasi-real viewpoint</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 7, XP</p>

      <p>
        You send your mind across space and dimensions, forming it into a quasireal viewpoint from which you can see and
        hear some creature located at any distance from you, even if planar boundaries separate you. If the subject
        succeeds on a Will save, the <i>remote viewing </i>attempt fails, and you can’t attempt to view that creature
        again for at least 24 hours. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort
        of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it
        gets a +5 bonus on its Will save.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the subject fails its Will save, your mind coalesces a quasi-real viewpoint near enough to the subject to see
        and hear the subject and its immediate surroundings (up 30 feet in all directions away from the subject).
      </p>

      <p>
        While the <i>remote viewing </i>lasts, your real body remains unmoving and unaware of your actual surroundings.
        On the other hand, your quasi-real viewpoint is treated in some ways as if it were an invisible
        <i>ectoplasmic form </i>of yourself, except as follows. This power is of the Scrying subdiscipline, but use the
        following information in place of the standard scrying sensor. As a quasi-real viewpoint, you can speak (though
        your voice is whispery).
      </p>

      <p>
        You may potentially be sensed by the subject of your viewing (subjects who can see or sense invisible or hidden
        creatures automatically sense you; otherwise you make a Hide check with a +40 bonus to escape detection if
        immobile, or a +20 bonus if moving). You could be attacked (although if you become subject to
        <i>dispel psionics</i>, the <i>remote viewing </i>simply ends). If the subject moves, you can attempt to follow
        it at a speed of 20 feet, though if it gets farther than 30 feet from you (or you move farther than 30 feet from
        it), the power ends.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can attempt to manifest one power through your quasi-real viewpoint, but you must make a Concentration check
        (DC 20 + level of the power you wish to manifest) to succeed. Manifesting (or attempting and failing to
        manifest) a power immediately ends the <i>remote viewing.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, all powers from your quasi-real viewpoint cost twice the usual number of power points (you can’t
        exceed the power point limit set by your manifester level, so you are restricted to manifesting lower-level
        powers than you otherwise could). Power points you spend as a quasireal viewpoint are drained from your real
        body.
      </p>

      <p><i>XP Cost: </i>20 XP.</p>

      <h3>Restoration, Psionic</h3>

      <p>Psychometabolism (Healing)</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Egoist 6</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Material</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 3 rounds</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> Creature touched</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (harmless)</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 11</p>

      <p>
        This power cures all ability damage, and it restores all points drained from a single ability score (your choice
        if more than one score is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target.
        <i>Restoration </i>does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Restoration </i>can remove negative levels. It can also restore one level to a creature who has had a level
        drained, if the number of days since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than your manifester level.
        In such a case, <i>restoration </i>brings the creature up to the minimum number of experience points necessary
        to advance it to the next higher level, gaining it an additional Hit Die and level benefits accordingly.
      </p>

      <h3>Restore Extremity</h3>

      <p>Psychometabolism (Healing)</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Egoist 5</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Auditory</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> Creature touched</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will half (harmless)</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 9</p>

      <p>
        You restore a severed extremity to a creature that has lost a digit, hand, arm, leg, or even its head. This
        power does not restore life, but it returns a lost extremity to a living or dead creature if the creature is
        otherwise mostly intact. The original extremity need not be present when this power is manifested; a new
        extremity is created by the power. If a head is restored to a body, the original head (if not already destroyed)
        loses all spark of identity, and can be considered so much dead tissue.

        You automatically teleport an item you can see within range directly to your hand. If the object is in the
        possession of an opponent, it comes to your hand if your opponent fails a Will save.

      <h3>Schism</h3>

      <p>Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Telepath 4</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Auditory and visual</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Personal</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> You</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 7</p>

      <p>
        Your mind splits into two independent parts. Each part functions in complete autonomy, like two characters in
        one body. Your new “second mind” does not control your body physically but is free to take one standard action
        in each round if the action is purely mental (such as manifesting a power) in the same round you take your
        normal actions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your second mind can manifest powers using your power point reserve, but only as if your manifester level were
        six lower than it is. Your second mind doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity when manifesting a power, because
        doing so doesn’t distract your primary mind.
      </p>

      <p>Your second mind takes its first action on your turn in the round after <i>schism </i>is manifested.</p>

      <p>
        Both your minds communicate with each other telepathically. If you are subject to a compulsion or charm effect
        while you are of two minds, make a second saving throw if you fail the first. If you fail both, then the
        <i>schism </i>ends and you are affected normally by the power. If you fail just one, the <i>schism </i>ends
        immediately, but you are not subject to the compulsion or charm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your second mind does not gain any advantages if you are subject to a <i>haste </i>effect, although you gain the
        overall standard benefits.
      </p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 9</p>

      <p>
        You take a hand in influencing the probable outcomes of your immediate environment. You see the many alternative
        branches that reality could take in the next few seconds, and with this foreknowledge you gain the ability to
        reroll one attack roll, one saving throw, one ability check, or one skill check each round. You must take the
        result of the reroll, even if it’s worse than the original roll. You do not have to make another roll if
        satisfied with your original roll.
      </p>

      <h3>Sense Link</h3>

      <p>Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 1</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Visual</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One willing creature</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1min./level</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        You perceive what the subject creature perceives using its sight, hearing, taste, or smell. Only one sense is
        linked, and you cannot switch between senses with the same manifestation.
      </p>

      <p>
        You make any skill checks involving senses, such as Spot or Listen, as the subject, and only within the
        subject’s field of view. You lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while directly sensing what the subject senses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once <i>sense link </i>is manifested, the link persists even if the subject moves out of the range of the
        original manifestation (but the link does not work across planes). You do not control the subject, nor can you
        communicate with it by means of this power.
      </p>

      <p>
        The strength of the subject’s linked sense could be enhanced by other powers or items, allowing you the same
        enhanced sense. You are subject to any gaze attack affecting the subject creature (if you linked vision). If you
        are blinded or deafened, or suffer some other sensory deprivation, the linked creature functions as an
        independent sensory organ, and provides you the benefit of the linked sense from its perspective while this
        power’s duration lasts.
      </p>

      <p><b>Augment:</b> You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.</p>

      <p>
        1. If you spend 2 additional power points, you can have the subject perceive one of your senses instead of the
        other way around.
      </p>

      <p>2. If you spend 4 additional power points, you can link to a second sense of the same subject.</p>

        be augmented.

      <h3>Sensitivity to Psychic Impressions</h3>

      <p>Clairsentience</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Seer 2</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Auditory and material</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 hour</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> Spread with a radius of 25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels, centered on you</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 min./level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 3</p>

      <p>
        You gain historical vision in a given location. Rooms, streets, tunnels, and other discrete locations accumulate
        psychic impressions left by powerful emotions experienced in a given area. These impressions offer you a picture
        of the location’s past.
      </p>

      <p>
        The types of events most likely to leave psychic impressions are those that elicited strong emotions: battles
        and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and great pain, or any other event where one emotion dominates.
        Everyday occurrences leave no residue for a manifester to detect.
      </p>

      <p>
        The vision of the event is dreamlike and shadowy. You do not gain special knowledge of those involved in the
        vision, though you might be able to read large banners or other writing if they are in your language.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beginning with the most recent significant event at a location and working backward in time, you can sense one
        distinct event for every 10 minutes you maintain concentration, if any such events exist to be sensed. Your
        sensitivity extends into the past a maximum number of years equal to 100 x your manifester level.

      <h3>Shadow Body</h3>

      <p>Psychometabolism</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 8</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Auditory</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Personal</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> You</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 15</p>

      <p>
        Your body and all your equipment are subsumed by your shadow. As a living shadow, you blend perfectly into any
        other shadow and vanish in darkness. You appear as an unattached shadow in areas of full light.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can move at your normal speed, on any surface, including walls and ceilings, as well as across the surfaces
        of liquids—even up the face of a waterfall.
      </p>

      <p>Your space does not change, so you cannot move into locations you would not normally be able to move into.</p>

      <p>
        While in your <i>shadow body, </i>you gain damage reduction 10/magic and darkvision out to 60 feet. You are
        immune to extra damage from critical hits, ability damage, disease, drowning, and poison. You take only half
        damage from acid, electricity, and fire of all kinds.
      </p>

      <p>
        While affected by this power, you can be detected by powers that read thoughts, life, or presences (including
        <i>true seeing</i>), or if you make suspicious movements in lighted areas.
      </p>

      <p>
        You cannot harm anyone physically or manipulate any objects, but you can use your powers normally. Doing so may
        attract notice, but if you remain in a shadowed area, you get a +15 bonus on your Hide check to remain
        unnoticed.
      </p>

      <h3>Share Pain</h3>

      <p>Psychometabolism</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 2</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Material and mental</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

      <p><b>Targets:</b> You and one willing creature, or two willing creatures; see text</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 3</p>

      <p>
        This power creates a psychometabolic connection between you and a willing subject so that some of your wounds
        are transferred to the subject. You take half damage from all attacks that deal hit point damage to you, and the
        subject takes the remainder. The amount of damage not taken by you is taken by the subject. If your hit points
        are reduced by a lowered Constitution score, that reduction is not shared with the subject because it is not a
        form of hit point damage. When this power ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and
        you, but damage already shared is not reassigned.
      </p>

      <p>If you and the subject move farther away from each other than close range, the power ends.</p>

      <p>
        You can manifest this power on two willing subjects, one of which you designate to share its damage with the
        other.
      </p>

      <h3>Share Pain, Forced</h3>

      <p>Psychometabolism</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 5</p>

      <p>As <i>share pain</i>, except as noted here.</p>

      <p>
        You attempt to force the sharing of your wounds with an unwilling creature, and for less time. If you are immune
        to the type of damage dealt, or if you convert lethal damage into nonlethal damage, the target takes no damage.
      </p>

      <p><b>Augment:</b> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s save DC increases by 1.</p>

      <h3>Shatter Mind Blank</h3>

      <p>Telepathy</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 5</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Olfactory</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> 30 ft.</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> 30-ft.-radius burst centered on you</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 9</p>

      <p>
        This power can negate a <i>psionic mind blank </i>or a <i>personal mind blank </i>affecting the target. If the
        target fails its save and does not overcome your attempt with its power resistance, you can shatter the mind
        blank by making a successful check (1d20 + your manifester level, maximum +20) against a DC equal to 11 + the
        manifester level of the creator of the <i>mind blank </i>effect. If you succeed, the
        <i>psionic mind blank </i>or <i>personal mind blank </i>ends, allowing you to affect the target thereafter with
        mind-affecting powers.
      </p>

      <h3>Skate</h3>

      <p>Psychoportation</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 1, psychic warrior 1</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Material and visual</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Personal or touch; see text</p>

      <p>
        <b>Target:</b> You or one willing creature or one unattended object (total weight up to 100 lb./level); see text
      </p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless, object)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        You, another willing creature, or an unattended object can slide along solid ground as if on smooth ice. If you
        manifest <i>skate </i>on yourself or another creature, the subject of the power retains equilibrium by mental
        desire alone, allowing her to gracefully skate along the ground, turn, or stop suddenly as desired. The skater’s
        land speed increases by 15 feet. (This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.) As with any effect that
        increases speed, this power affects the subject’s maximum jumping distance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The subject can skate up or down any incline or decline she could normally walk upon without mishap, though
        skating up an incline reduces the subject’s speed to normal, while skating down a decline increases her speed by
        an additional 15 feet. (This adjustment is treated as a circumstance bonus.)
      </p>

      <p>
        If you manifest <i>skate </i>on an object, treat the object as having only one-tenth of its normal weight for
        the purpose of dragging it along the ground.
      </p>

      <h3>Solicit Psicrystal</h3>

      <p>Telepathy</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 3</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 swift action</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> Your psicrystal</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 5</p>

      <p>Your psicrystal takes over the responsibility of maintaining concentration on any single power you</p>

      <p>
        have manifested and are concentrating on. While maintaining this concentration, the psicrystal is limited to
        move actions in each round, as normal. When the duration of <i>solicit psicrystal </i>expires, the power you
        transferred to the psicrystal ends (even if this would mean that the power ends earlier than normal). If
        necessary, the psicrystal makes Concentration checks using your Concentration modifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can manifest this power (and transfer the responsibility) with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain
        the benefit of the power before you take any other actions in a round. Manifesting the power is a swift action,
        like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. You
        cannot manifest this power when it isn’t your turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s maximum duration increases by 1 round.
      </p>

      <h3>Steadfast Perception</h3>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 10 min./level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 7</p>

      <p>
        Your vision cannot be distracted or misled, granting you immunity to all figments and glamers (such as
        <i>invisibility</i>). Moreover, your Spot and Search checks receive a +6 enhancement bonus for the duration of
        this power. This power also grants you another saving throw against someone using <i>false sensory input </i>on
        you, but you must realize that that power has been used in order to know enough to manifest
        <i>steadfast perception</i>.
      </p>

      <h3>Stomp</h3>

      <p>Psychokinesis</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        Your foot stomp precipitates a psychokinetic shock wave that travels along the ground, toppling creatures and
        loose objects. The shock wave affects only creatures standing on the ground within the power’s area. Creatures
        that fail their saves are thrown to the ground, become prone, and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s nonlethal damage increases by 1d4
        points.

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 3</p>

      <p>
        You gain the ability to siphon away your enemy’s strength for your own use. One of your natural or manufactured
        weapons becomes the instrument of your desire, and deals 1 point of Strength damage on each successful hit. You
        gain that point of Strength as an enhancement bonus to your Strength score. Strength you siphon from different
        foes is tracked separately—the total siphoned from each individual foe is considered a separate enhancement
        bonus to your Strength (maximum +8), and you gain only the highest total.
      </p>

      <p><b>Augment:</b> You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.</p>

      <p>
        1. For every 3 additional power points you spend, the maximum enhancement bonus you can add to your Strength
        increases by 2.
      </p>

      <p>2. If you spend 6 additional power points, you can manifest this power as a swift action.</p>

      <p>
        You can place yourself into a trance so deep that you are almost in suspended animation. Even powers that detect
        life or thought are incapable of determining that you are alive.
      </p>

      <p>
        While you are suspended, you are aware of your surroundings. You feel the passage of one day for every year that
        actually passes. Though on a slower schedule, you grow hungry after a “day” without food (though a year passes
        in actuality) and begin to suffer the effects of thirst and starvation as appropriate.

      <p>
        If you take any damage, you come out of your trance 4 rounds later. The trance can also be ended by a successful
        use of <i>dispel psionics. </i>If you choose to dismiss the power, your trance ends 10 rounds later.

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>

      <p>
        You receive one kind of sensory input when a different sense is stimulated. In particular, you can either feel
        light or feel sound. You can shift your stimulated sense between these two options once per round as a swift
        action. Your senses continue to work normally as well, unless they are impaired for some reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your face must be uncovered to use this power, because it is the skin of your face that acts as the sensory
        receiver.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are feeling light by absorbing ambient light onto your skin, you have your normal visual abilities
        (except for darkvision), even if your eyes are closed or you are blinded. If your eyes are working normally, you
        gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all Spot and Search checks. While feeling light, you are immune to gaze attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are feeling sound by absorbing sound onto your skin and your ears are working normally, the expanded
        audio input provides you with a +4 circumstance bonus on Listen checks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Psionic or magical displacement effects, invisibility effects, illusions, and other similar effects confuse your
        <i>synesthete </i>senses just as they would your normal senses.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also use this power to see sound if you are deafened, or hear light if you are blinded, thus removing
        all penalties associated with either condition (though you gain no bonuses for using the power in this way if
        you are not deafened or blinded).

      <h3>Telekinetic Force</h3>

      <p>Psychokinesis [Force]</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 3</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> One object at a time</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 round/level</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (object); see text</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes (object)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 5</p>

      <p>
        You move an object by concentrating your mind upon its current location and then the location you desire,
        creating a sustained force. You can move an object weighing no more than 250 pounds up to 20 feet per round. A
        creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with power resistance.
        The weight can be moved across the ground or through the air. This power ends if the object is forced out of
        range. If you cease concentration, the object falls or stops.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can drop a weight and pick up another during the power’s duration, as long as you don’t stop concentrating
        on maintaining the power. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if you were moving it with one hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you spend at least 5 rounds concentrating on an unattended object, you can attempt to break or burst it as if
        making a Strength check, except that you apply your key ability modifier to the check instead of your Strength
        modifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, the weight limit of the target increases by 25
        pounds.

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 7</p>

      <p>
        You can affect a foe by concentrating your mind upon its current status and the status you desire, once per
        round. You can perform a bull rush, a disarm, a grapple (including a pin), or a trip. Resolve these attempts as
        normal, except that they don’t provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your manifester level in place of your
        base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple attempts), you use your Intelligence modifier in place of your
        Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn’t allow a reactive attempt by the target
        (such as normally allowed on disarm or trip attempts). No save is allowed against these attempts, but power
        resistance applies normally.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power grants a +1 bonus on your checks
        involving bull rush, disarm, grapple, or trip attempts.

      <p>Psychokinesis</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Psion/wilder 3</p>

      <p><b>Display:</b> Visual</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 standard action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level)</p>

      <p><b>Target or Targets:</b> One or more objects or creatures with a total weight of 250 lb. or less</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates or Will negates (object); see text</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes or Yes (object); see text</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 5</p>

      <p>
        You can affect one or more objects or creatures by concentrating your mind upon, sending them in a deadly hail
        at your foes—or simply by hurling your foe! You can hurl one object or creature per manifester level (maximum
        fifteen separate targets), as long as all are within the power’s range and each is no more than 10 feet away
        from another one. Each object or creature can be hurled a maximum distance of 10 feet per level.
      </p>

      <p>
        You must succeed on ranged attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target of the hurled
        items with the items, applying your Intelligence modifier to the attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier.
        Hurled weapons deal their standard damage (your Strength bonus does not apply; arrows or bolts deal damage as
        daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects deal damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds of
        weight (for less dangerous objects such as an empty barrel) to 1d6 points per 25 pounds of weight (for hard,
        dense objects such as a boulder).
      </p>

      <p>
        Creatures are allowed Will saves (and power resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held
        possessions are targeted by this power.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you use this power to hurl a creature against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet
        (1d6 points).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, the weight limit of the target or targets increases
        by 25 pounds.

      <p>
        You alter the subject’s mood, adjusting its attitude toward you by one step in a positive direction. For
        instance, an unfriendly creature can be made indifferent, or a hostile creature unfriendly. You can grant a +4
        bonus on your own (or others’) Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Perform, or Sense Motive checks involving the

      <p>
        You specify a situation that triggers your automatic manifestation of a <i>psionic teleport, </i>taking you to a
        predetermined location. You must know the <i>psionic teleport </i>power and have sufficient power points to
        manifest it when the specified situation occurs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>teleport trigger </i>goes off on the initiative count immediately after the specified situation occurs,
        even if you are flat-footed or you have already taken your turn in the current round. The specified situation
        can be described in general terms or specific terms.

      <h3>Temporal Acceleration</h3>

      <p>Psychoportation</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 swift action</p>

      <p><b>Range:</b> Personal</p>

      <p><b>Target:</b> You</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round (in apparent time); see text</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 11</p>

      <p>
        You enter another time frame, speeding up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are
        actually still moving at normal speed. You are free to act for 1 round of apparent time. You can manifest
        powers, cast spells, move, or perform other types of actions, subject to the restrictions outlined below.
      </p>

      <p>
        While your <i>temporal acceleration </i>is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and
        powers. This means you cannot target a creature with any attack or power. However, a power you manifest that
        affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of your <i>temporal acceleration </i>has
        its normal effect on creatures in the area once this power ends.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can affect an unattended object but not an object held, carried, or worn by another creature. You are
        undetectable by any means while your <i>temporal acceleration </i>lasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        While under the effect of this power, you cannot enter an area protected by a <i>null psionics field </i>or by a
        power or spell that neutralizes high-level powers or spells. Normal and magical fire, cold, acid, and the like
        can still harm you.
      </p>

      <p>
        When your <i>temporal acceleration </i>expires, you resume acting during your current turn in the standard time
        frame. You are shaken for 1 round upon your return to the standard time frame.
      </p>

      <p>
        Splintered or partitioned minds within your own mind, such as might be in effect through the use of powers such
        as <i>schism</i>, are not temporally speeded up, even if your second mind manifested this power (your primary
        mind gains the benefit, while your second mind remains stuck in the standard time frame).
      </p>

      <p>
        Manifesting this power is a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal
        limit of one quickened power per round. You cannot manifest this power when it isn’t your turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every 4 additional power points you spend, this power’s duration (in apparent time)
        increases by 1 round.

        Your skin or natural armor thickens and spreads across your body, providing a +1 enhancement bonus to your Armor
        Class.
      </p>

      <p><b>Augment:</b> You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.</p>

      <p>1. For every 3 additional power points you spend, the enhancement bonus increases by 1.</p>

      <p>2. If you spend 6 additional power points, you can manifest this power as a swift action.</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 3</p>

      <p>You fortify your mind against intrusions, gaining power resistance 13 against all mind-affecting powers.</p>

      <p>
        You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefits in an emergency. Manifesting the
        power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one
        quickened power per round. You can use this power even when it’s not your turn.
      </p>

      <p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> Yes</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 5</p>

      <p>
        The subject of the power hops forward in time 1 round for every manifester level you have. In effect, the
        subject seems to disappear in a shimmer of silver energy, then reappear after the duration of this power
        expires. The subject reappears in exactly the same orientation and condition as before. From the subject’s point
        of view, no time has passed at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        In each round of the power’s duration, on what would have been the subject’s turn, it can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom
        check. Success allows the subject to return. The subject can act normally on its next turn after this power
        ends.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the space from which the subject departed is occupied upon his return to the time stream, he appears in the
        closest unoccupied space, still in his original orientation. Determine the closest space randomly if necessary.
      </p>

      <p><b>Augment:</b> You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.</p>

      <p>
        1. For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can affect a creature of one size category larger, or
        double the weight of an object to be affected.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power can affect an additional target. Any additional
        target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the power.

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 15</p>

      <p>
        As <i>time hop</i>, except you can affect any number of willing subjects in range, including yourself. You can
        choose which creatures are affected by the power. The subjects hop forward in time a number of hours equal to
        your manifester level, or some shorter number of hours; you decide how many hours the <i>mass time hop </i>lasts
        when you manifest the power.
      </p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 17, XP</p>

      <p>
        You can regress apparent time 1 round into the past. In effect, you “replay” the previous round of activity. The
        power regresses time to the point along the time stream just prior to your previous turn, undoing the effects of
        everyone else’s actions in the meantime. Once you have used <i>time regression, </i>only you retain knowledge of
        what happened during the round that is being replayed; however, you can communicate that knowledge verbally to
        your companions, if desired. During the round that you live through a second time, you can act on knowledge you
        previously gained by already living through the immediate future. In all likelihood, you’ll probably not choose
        to manifest <i>time regression </i>during your second pass through the time stream, instead taking completely
        new actions, but you pay the XP cost all the same.

        Your body ignores all harmful (and helpful) effects, beginning when you finish manifesting this power and ending

      <p>Psychokinesis</p>

      <p><b>Level:</b> Kineticist 9</p>

      <p><b>Manifesting Time:</b> 1 round</p>

      <p><b>Area:</b> 40-ft.-radius spread</p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half; see text</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 17</p>

      <p>
        You induce the formation of a slender vortex of fiercely swirling air. When you manifest it, a vortex of air
        visibly and audibly snakes out from your outstretched hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to aim the vortex at a specific creature, you can make a ranged touch attack to strike the creature.
        If you succeed, direct contact with the vortex deals 8d6 points of damage to the creature (no save).
      </p>

      <p>
        Regardless of whether your ranged touch attack hits (and even if you forgo the attack), all creatures in the
        area (including the one possibly damaged by direct contact) are picked up and violently dashed about, dealing
        17d6 points of damage to each one. Creatures that make a successful Reflex save take half damage.
      </p>

      <p>
        After being dashed about, each creature that was affected finds itself situated in a new space 1d4 x 10 feet
        away from its original space in a random direction. Walls and other barriers can restrict this relocation; in
        such a case, the creature ends up adjacent to the barrier.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s area damage (not the damage from direct
        contact dealt to a specific creature) increases by 1d6 points (to a maximum of 24d6 points). For each extra 2d6
        points of damage, this power’s save DC increases by 1.

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 5</p>

      <p>
        You generate a subtle telekinetic field of mental contact, allowing you to “feel” your surroundings even in
        total darkness or when your sight would otherwise be obscured by your physical environment. Your
        <i>touchsight </i>field emanates from you out to 60 feet. You ignore invisibility, darkness, and concealment,
        though you must have line of effect to a creature or an object to discern it. You do not need to make Spot or
        Listen checks to notice creatures; you can detect and pinpoint all creatures within 60 feet. In many
        circumstances, comparing your regular senses to what you learn with <i>touchsight </i>is enough to tell you the
        difference between visible, invisible, hiding, and concealed creatures.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every 2 additional power points you spend, the radius of your <i>touchsight </i>field
        increases by 10 feet.

      <p>
        You generate a bastion of thought so strong that it offers protection to you and everyone around you, improving
        the self-control of all. You and all creatures in the power’s area gain power resistance 19 against all
        mindaffecting powers.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefits in an emergency. Manifesting the
        power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one
        quickened power per round.
      </p>

      <p>You can use this power even when it is not your turn.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s duration increases by 1 round and the
        power resistance it provides increases by 1 point.

        made by others within this power’s area within the last minute.
      </p>

      <p>
        You know the direction and distance the individuals traveled and could teleport to the location yourself if you
        so desired (and if you know the <i>psionic teleport </i>power), as if you had “seen casually” the location. This
        power does not grant you any information on the conditions at the other end of the trace beyond the mental
        coordinates of the location.
      </p>

      <p>

        You are difficult to kill while this power persists. You automatically heal damage at the rate of 10 hit points
        per round.
      </p>

      <p>
        This power is not effective against damage from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. Also, attack forms that
        don’t deal hit point damage (for example, most poisons) ignore <i>true metabolism</i>. You can also use this
        power to regrow lost portions of your body and to reattach severed limbs or body parts, if you do nothing but
        concentrate on regrowing the lost body part or reattaching the severed limb for the duration of the power. You
        do not gain the benefits described earlier when you manifest <i>true metabolism </i>for this purpose. You must
        have a Constitution score to gain any of this power’s benefits.

        If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect such as
        <i>claws of the beast</i>), you can use this power to produce a horrible poison that coats one of your claws. On
        your next successful melee attack with the claw during the power’s duration, the poison deals 1d8 points of
        Constitution damage immediately and another 1d8 points of Constitution damage 1 minute later. The target of your
        attack can negate each instance of damage with a Fortitude save.

        You have metaphoric “eyes in the back of your head,” and on the sides and top as well, granting you benefits in
        specific situations. In effect, you have a 360-degree sphere of sight, allowing you a perfect view of creatures
        that might otherwise flank you. Thus, flanking opponents gain no bonus on their attack rolls, and rogues are
        denied their sneak attack ability because you do not lose your Dexterity bonus (but they may still sneak attack
        you if you are caught flat-footed). Your Spot and Search checks gain a +4 enhancement bonus. Concurrently, you
        take a –4 penalty on saves against all gaze attacks during the power’s duration.

        You “grumble” psychically (which both psionic and nonpsionic creatures can detect), then release a horrid shriek
        from your subconscious that disrupts the brains of all enemies in the power’s area, dealing 13d6 points of
        damage to each enemy.

      <p>
        You suffuse yourself with power, gaining 5 temporary hit points. Using this power again when an earlier
        manifestation has not expired merely replaces the older temporary hit points (if any remain) with the newer
        ones.

      <h3>Wall of Ectoplasm</h3>

      <p>
        <b>Effect:</b> Wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square/level or a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to
        1 ft./level
      </p>

      <p><b>Duration:</b> 1 min./level (D)</p>

      <p><b>Saving Throw:</b> None</p>

      <p><b>Power Resistance:</b> No</p>

      <p><b>Power Points:</b> 7</p>

      <p>
        You fashion a roiling wall of ectoplasm, imbuing it with solidity. The wall cannot move once it is formed. It is
        1 inch thick per four manifester levels and occupies up to one 5-foot square per level. Each 5-foot square of
        the wall has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5. A section of the wall whose hit points drop to
        0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 2 per inch
        of thickness.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>wall of ectoplasm </i>is susceptible to <i>dispel psionics</i>, but it gains a +4 bonus on any check to
        determine whether the wall is negated. Spells, powers, and breath weapons cannot pass through the wall in either
        direction (though they could damage it). It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures (though
        ethereal creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and
        ceilings). The wall is opaque, so neither vision nor gaze attacks operate through it. The wall does not block
        psychoportive travel, such as that provided by the <i>psionic teleport </i>power.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square per level or into a
        sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 1 foot per level.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>wall of ectoplasm </i>must be continuous and unbroken when manifested. If its surface is interrupted by
        any object or creature, the power fails.

      <p>
        You can walk on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings (you need not make Climb checks to traverse these
        surfaces). Because of the need to keep at least one foot in contact with the wall or ceiling at all times, you
        cannot jump or use the run action, and you can move at only half speed.
      </p>

      <p>You retain your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, if any, and opponents gain no special bonuses against you.</p>
