      <h4>Class Features</h4>

      <p>All of the following are class features of the barbarian.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor,
        medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Fast Movement (Ex):</b> A barbarian’s land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This
        benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load.
        Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian’s speed because of any load carried or armor worn.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Illiteracy:</b> Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A
        barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak.
      </p>

      <p>
        A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a
        barbarian level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Rage (Ex):</b> A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian
        temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but
        he takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian’s hit points by 2
        points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to
        normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian
        cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist,
        Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can
        he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell
        completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation
        feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character’s (newly
        improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian
        loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (–2 penalty to Strength, –2 penalty to Dexterity,
        can’t charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which
        point this limitation no longer applies; see below).
      </p>

      <p>
        A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day.
        At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six
        times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his
        action, not in response to someone else’s action.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is
        caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if
        immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved
        uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Trap Sense (Ex):</b> Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps
        and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels
        thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense
        denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four
        more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above)
        from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the
        classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Damage Reduction (Ex):</b> At 7th level, a barbarian gains Damage Reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the
        barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three
        barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage
        reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Greater Rage (Ex):</b> At 11th level, a barbarian’s bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each
        increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at –2.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Indomitable Will (Ex):</b> While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will
        saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on
        Will saves he also receives during his rage.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Tireless Rage (Ex):</b> At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his
        rage.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Mighty Rage (Ex):</b> At 20th level, a barbarian’s bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each
        increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at –2.
      </p>

      <h4>Ex-Barbarians</h4>

      <p>
        A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. He retains
        all the other benefits of the class (damage reduction, fast movement, trap sense, and uncanny dodge).
      </p>

      <h4>Class Features</h4>

      <p>All of the following are class features of the bard.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier,
        sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).
        A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance.
        However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a
        chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass bard
        still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spells:</b> A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he
        knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music).
        To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell. The Difficulty
        Class for a saving throw against a bard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard’s Charisma modifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base
        daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Bard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a
        high Charisma score. When Table: Bard Spells Known indicates that the bard gets 0 spells per day of a given
        spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell
        level.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bard’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your
        choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Bard Spells Known.
        (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on
        Table: Bard Spells Known are fixed.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to
        learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard “loses” the old spell in exchange for
        the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at
        least two levels lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell
        at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells
        known for the level.
      </p>

      <p>
        As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time,
        assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bardic Knowledge:</b> A bard may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level +
        his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people,
        legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2
        bonus on this check.)
      </p>

      <p>
        A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its
        general function. A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random.
      </p>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        <b>Bardic Music:</b> Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects
        on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of
        bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting
        poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an
        instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a
        minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in
        at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which
        means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music
        that doesn’t require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as
        scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just as for casting a spell with a verbal
        component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt
        still counts against his daily limit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Countersong (Su): </i>A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter
        magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the
        countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself )
        that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard’s Perform check result in
        place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If
        a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or
        language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the
        countersong, but it must use the bard’s Perform check result for the save. Countersong has no effect against
        effects that don’t allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Fascinate (Sp): </i>A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one
        or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to
        see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The
        distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard
        attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature’s Will
        save against the effect. If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that
        creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song,
        taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round
        per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a –4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen
        and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a
        new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target,
        automatically breaks the effect. <i>Fascinate </i>is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Inspire Courage (Su): </i>A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire
        courage in his allies (including himself ), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities.
        To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the
        bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against
        charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard
        levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a
        mind-affecting ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Inspire Competence (Su): </i>A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use
        his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear
        the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to
        hear the bard’s music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as the bard
        concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can’t inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a
        mind-affecting ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Suggestion (Sp): </i>A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a
        <i>suggestion </i>(as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability
        does not break the bard’s concentration on the <i>fascinate </i>effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw
        against the <i>fascinate </i>effect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Making a <i>suggestion </i>doesn’t count against a bard’s daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will
        saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard’s level + bard’s Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a
        single creature (but see <i>mass suggestion</i>, below). <i>Suggestion </i>is an enchantment (compulsion),
        mind-affecting, language dependent ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Inspire Greatness (Su): </i>A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use
        music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her
        extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally
        with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard
        must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5
        rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of
        temporary hit points (apply the target’s Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2
        competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as
        regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a
        mind-affecting ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Song of Freedom (Sp): </i>A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use
        music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the <i>break enchantment </i>spell (caster level equals the
        character’s bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it
        functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can’t use <i>song of freedom </i>on himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Inspire Heroics (Su): </i>A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use
        music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. For every
        three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To
        inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired
        gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally
        hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Mass Suggestion (Sp): </i>This ability functions like <i>suggestion, </i>above, except that a bard of 18th
        level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the <i>suggestion </i>simultaneously to any
        number of creatures that he has already fascinated (see above). <i>Mass suggestion </i>is an enchantment
        (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.
      </p>

      <h4>Ex-Bards</h4>

      <h4>Class Features</h4>

      <p>All of the following are class features of the cleric.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor
        (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields (except tower shields).
      </p>

      <p>
        A cleric who chooses the War domain receives the Weapon Focus feat related to his deity’s weapon as a bonus
        feat. He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into
        that category.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Aura (Ex):</b> A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura
        corresponding to the deity’s alignment (see the <i>detect evil </i>spell for details). Clerics who don’t worship
        a specific deity but choose the Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain have a similarly powerful aura of the
        corresponding alignment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spells:</b> A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the cleric spell list. However, his alignment
        may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good,
        and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).
      </p>

      <p>
        To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The
        Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric’s Wisdom
        modifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base
        daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Cleric. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a
        high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level.
        When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see Deities,
        Domains, and Domain Spells, below).
      </p>

      <p>
        Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day
        in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect
        on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list,
        provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily
        meditation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells:</b> A cleric’s deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform,
        his values, and how others see him. A cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to his deity. A
        cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two domains to represent his spiritual
        inclinations and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well
        as a granted power. The cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected.
      </p>

      <p>
        With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his
        domain spell slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain
        spell slot.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spontaneous Casting:</b> A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy
        into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can “lose” any prepared spell that
        is not a domain spell in order to cast any <i>cure </i>spell of the same spell level or lower (a
        <i>cure </i>spell is any spell with “cure” in its name).
      </p>

      <p>
        An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), can’t convert prepared spells to <i>cure </i>spells but
        can convert them to <i>inflict </i>spells (an <i>inflict </i>spell is one with “inflict” in its name).
      </p>

      <p>
        A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either
        <i>cure </i>spells or <i>inflict </i>spells (player’s choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be
        reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or commands undead (see below).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:</b> A cleric can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or
        his deity’s (if he has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil,
        good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su):</b> Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures
        by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead).
      </p>

      <p>
        A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil
        cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures. A neutral
        cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether his turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil
        cleric. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can
        cast spontaneous <i>cure </i>or <i>inflict </i>spells (see above).
      </p>

      <p>
        A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A cleric with
        5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Languages:</b> A cleric’s bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the
        languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the
        bonus languages available to the character because of his race.
      </p>

      <h4>Ex-Clerics</h4>

      <p>
        A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells and class features,
        except for armor and shield proficiencies and proficiency with simple weapons. He cannot thereafter gain levels
        as a cleric of that god until he atones (see the <i>atonement </i>spell description).

      <h4>Class Features</h4>

      <p>All of the following are class features of the druid.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart,
        quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks
        (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).
      </p>

      <p>
        Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may
        wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the
        <i>ironwood </i>spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the <i>ironwood </i>spell description)
        Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of
        her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spells:</b> A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid spell list. Her alignment may
        restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and
        Lawful Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below).
      </p>

      <p>
        To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The
        Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid’s Wisdom
        modifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base
        daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a
        high Wisdom score. She does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.
      </p>

      <p>
        A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a
        <i>cure </i>spell in its place (but see Spontaneous Casting, below). A druid may prepare and cast any spell on
        the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to
        prepare during her daily meditation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Spontaneous Casting:</b> A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn’t
        prepared ahead of time. She can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature’s ally </i>spell
        of the same level or lower.<b> Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:</b> A druid can’t cast spells of an
        alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are
        indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Languages:</b> A druid’s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures.
        This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.
      </p>

      <p>
        A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level
        druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of
        languages and it doesn’t take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.
      </p>

      <p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Animal Companion (Ex):</b> A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list:
        badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium
        viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures
        are also available: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that
        accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind.
      </p>

      <p>
        A 1st-level druid’s companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As a druid advances in
        level, the animal’s power increases as shown on the table. If a druid releases her companion from service, she
        may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also
        replace an animal companion that has perished.
      </p>

      <p>
        A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals (see below). Should she select an
        animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character’s druid
        level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the
        character’s druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the table to determine the animal
        companion’s powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid’s effective level to 0 or lower, she can’t have
        that animal as a companion.)
      </p>

      <p><b>Nature Sense (Ex):</b> A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b> A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a
        Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her
        Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.
      </p>

      <p>
        The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.
      </p>

      <p>
        To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be
        within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1
        minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.
      </p>

      <p>
        A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she
        takes a –4 penalty on the check.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Woodland Stride (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as
        natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or
        suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically
        manipulated to impede motion still affect her.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Trackless Step (Ex):</b> Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be
        tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Resist Nature’s Lure (Ex):</b> Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the
        spell-like abilities of fey.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Wild Shape (Su):</b> At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal
        and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability
        functions like the <i>polymorph </i>spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or
        until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of
        opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.</p>

      <p>
        A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal,
        untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as
        her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit
        speech.)
      </p>

      <p>
        A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, as noted on Table: The
        Druid<i>. </i>In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal
        at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level.
      </p>

      <p>The new form’s Hit Dice can’t exceed the character’s druid level.</p>

      <p>
        At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant creature with the same size
        restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can’t use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn’t a
        creature.)
      </p>

      <p>
        At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air,
        earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In
        addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental’s extraordinary, supernatural,
        and spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental’s feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but
        she retains her own creature type.
      </p>

      <p>
        At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so
        three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.
      </p>

      <p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex):</b> At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>

      <p>
        <b>A Thousand Faces (Su):</b> At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if
        using the <i>alter self </i>spell, but only while in her normal form.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Timeless Body (Ex):</b> After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging
        and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place.
      </p>

      <p>Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>

      <h4>Ex-Druids</h4>

      <p>
        A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a
        nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor,
        and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the
        <i>atonement </i>spell description).
      </p>

      <p>THE DRUID’S ANIMAL COMPANION</p>

      <p>
        A druid’s animal companion is different from a normal animal of its kind in many ways. A druid’s animal
        companion is superior to a normal animal of its kind and has special powers, as described below.

      <p>
        <b>Animal Companion Basics: </b>Use the base statistics for a creature of the companion’s kind,<i> </i>but make
        the following changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Class Level: </i>The character’s druid level. The druid’s class levels stack with levels of any other classes
        that are entitled to an animal companion for the purpose of determining the companion’s abilities and the
        alternative lists available to the character.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Bonus HD: </i>Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal.
        Remember that extra Hit Dice improve the animal companion’s base attack and base save bonuses. An animal
        companion’s base attack bonus is the same as that of a druid of a level equal to the animal’s HD. An animal
        companion has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal’s HD). An
        animal companion gains additional skill points and feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster’s Hit
        Dice.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Natural Armor Adj.: </i>The number noted here is an improvement to the animal companion’s existing natural
        armor bonus.
      </p>

      <p><i>Str/Dex Adj.: </i>Add this value to the animal companion’s Strength and Dexterity scores.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Bonus Tricks: </i>The value given in this column is the total number of “bonus” tricks that the animal knows
        in addition to any that the druid might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill). These bonus tricks
        don’t require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don’t count against the normal limit of tricks
        known by the animal. The druid selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can’t be changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Link (Ex): </i>A druid can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if
        she doesn’t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild
        empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Share Spells (Ex): </i>At the druid’s option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she
        casts upon herself also affect her animal companion. The animal companion must be within 5 feet of her at the
        time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops
        affecting the animal companion if the companion moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the animal
        again, even if it returns to the druid before the duration expires.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, the druid may cast a spell with a target of “You” on her animal companion (as a touch range spell)
        instead of on herself. A druid and her animal companion can share spells even if the spells normally do not
        affect creatures of the companion’s type (animal).
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Evasion (Ex): </i>If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw
        for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Devotion (Ex): </i>An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and
        effects.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Multiattack: </i>An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural
        attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks,
        the animal companion instead gains a second attack with its primary natural weapon, albeit at a –5 penalty.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Improved Evasion (Ex): </i>When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half
        damage, an animal companion takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the
        saving throw fails.
      </p>

      <p>ALTERNATIVE ANIMAL COMPANIONS</p>

      <p>
        A druid of sufficiently high level can select her animal companion from one of the following lists, applying the
        indicated adjustment to the druid’s level (in parentheses) for purposes of determining the companion’s

      <h4>Class Features</h4>

      <p>All of the following are class features of the fighter.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all
        armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields (including tower shields).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Feats:</b> At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any
        1st-level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The fighter gains an additional bonus
        feat at 2nd level and every two fighter levels thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and
        20th). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats. A fighter must still meet
        all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums.
      </p>

      <p>
        These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. A
        fighter is not limited to the list of fighter bonus feats when choosing these feats.

      <h4>Class Features</h4>

      <p>All of the following are class features of the monk.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Monks are proficient with club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe,
        javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and sling.
      </p>

      <p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields</p>

      <p>
        When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as
        her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>AC Bonus (Ex):</b> When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In
        addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels
        thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).
      </p>

      <p>
        These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses
        when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a
        medium or heavy load.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Flurry of Blows (Ex):</b> When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of
        accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this
        attack takes a –2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. The resulting modified base attack bonuses
        are shown in the Flurry of Blows Attack Bonus column on Table: The Monk. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it
        also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make before her next action. When a monk reaches 5th level,
        the penalty lessens to –1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must use a full attack action to strike with a
        flurry of blows.
      </p>

      <p>
        When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama,
        nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk
        weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength
        bonus (not Str bonus × 1-1/2 or × 1/2) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a
        weapon in one or both hands. The monk can’t use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry
        of blows.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of
        blows ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse unarmed
        strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra
        attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Unarmed Strike:</b> At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk’s attacks may
        be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make
        unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A
        monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Usually a monk’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no
        penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.
      </p>

      <p>
        A monk’s unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells
        and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.
      </p>

      <p>
        A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table: The Monk.
        The unarmed damage on Table: The Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given
        there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed
        Damage.

      <p>
        <b>Bonus Feat:</b> At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. At
        2nd level, she may select either Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may select
        either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally
        required for these feats to select them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Evasion (Ex):</b> At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack
        that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a
        monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Fast Movement (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed, as shown on Table: The
        Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Still Mind (Ex):</b> A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and
        effects from the school of enchantment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>Ki </i></b><b>Strike (Su):</b> At 4th level, a monk’s unarmed attacks are empowered with <i>ki. </i>Her
        unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage
        reduction. <i>Ki </i>strike improves with the character’s monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are
        also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th
        level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with
        damage reduction and bypassing hardness.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Slow Fall (Ex): </b>At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm’s reach of a wall can use it to slow her
        descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually
        is. The monk’s ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a
        wall) improves with her monk level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her descent and fall
        any distance without harm.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Purity of Body (Ex):</b> At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and
        magical diseases.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Wholeness of Body (Su):</b> At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of
        hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out among
        several uses.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Improved Evasion (Ex):</b> At 9th level, a monk’s evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a
        successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A
        helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
      </p>

      <p><b>Diamond Body (Su):</b> At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Abundant Step (Su):</b> At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the
        spell <i>dimension door, </i>once per day. Her caster level for this effect is one-half her monk level (rounded
        down).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Diamond Soul (Ex):</b> At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In
        order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster
        level) that equals or exceeds the monk’s spell resistance.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Quivering Palm (Su):</b> Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another
        creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a
        week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead,
        incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes
        successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk
        can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to
        her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the
        target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + the monk’s Wis modifier), it dies. If the
        saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it
        may still be affected by another one at a later time.

        <b>Timeless Body (Ex):</b> Upon attaining 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for
        aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in place.
        Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her time is up.
      </p>

      <p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): </b>A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Empty Body (Su):</b> At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk
        level per day, as though using the spell <i>etherealness</i>. She may go ethereal on a number of different
        occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not
        exceed her monk level.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Perfect Self:</b> At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider
        rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk’s creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical
        effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points
        of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn’t
        have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if
        she were a member of her previous creature type.
      </p>

      <h4>Ex-Monks</h4>

      <p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>

      <p>
        Like a member of any other class, a monk may be a multiclass character, but multiclass monks face a special
        restriction. A monk who gains a new class or (if already multiclass) raises another class by a level may never
        again raise her monk level, though she retains all her monk abilities.
