      <h1><a href="psionic-feats.html">PSIONIC FEATS</a></h1>

      <p>
        <a href="psionic-feats.html">Psionic feats</a> are available only to characters and creatures with the ability to manifest powers. (In other
        words, they either have a power point reserve or have <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-4">psi-like abilities</a>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Because <a href="psionic-feats.html">psionic feats</a> are supernatural abilities—a departure from the general rule that <a href="feats.html">feats</a> do not grant
        supernatural abilities—they cannot be disrupted in combat (as powers can be) and generally do not provoke
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a> (except as noted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not subject to power
        <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a> and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> is suppressed, such as
        a <i>null <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> field. </i>Leaving such an area immediately allows <a href="psionic-feats.html">psionic feats</a> to be used.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many <a href="psionic-feats.html">psionic feats</a> can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to expend your psionic
        focus to gain their benefit. Expending your psionic focus does not require an action; it is part of another
        action (such as using a feat). When you expend your psionic focus, it applies only to the action for which you
        expended it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-0-1"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-0-1">PSIONIC ITEM CREATION FEATS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Manifesters can use their personal power to create lasting <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a>. Doing so, however, is draining. A
        manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every psionic item he or she creates.
      </p>

      <p>
        A psionic item creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type
        of items they involve, the various <a href="feats.html#section-2-2">item creation feats</a> all have certain features in common.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>XP Cost:</b> Power and <a href="epic-spells.html#section-8-1">energy</a> that the manifester would normally keep is expended when making a psionic item.
        The <a href="epic-magic-items1.html#section-1">experience point cost</a> of using a psionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces.
        A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. However, upon gaining enough XP to
        attain a new <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to
        advance a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Raw Materials Cost:</b> Creating a psionic item requires costly <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>, most of which are consumed in the
        process. The cost of these materials equals 1/2 the cost of the item.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using a psionic item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop, special tools, and
        other <a href="equipment.html">equipment</a>. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply
        (such as if he’s traveling far from home).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Time:</b> The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is
        one day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Item Cost:</b> <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-13">Craft Dorje</a>, <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-37">Imprint Stone</a>, and <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-68">Scribe Tattoo</a> create items that directly reproduce the effects
        of powers, and the strength of these items depends on their <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>—that is, a power from such an item
        has the strength it would have if manifested by a manifester of that <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. Often, that is the minimum
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level </a> necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly discovered items usually follow this rule.) However,
        when making such an item, the item’s strength can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates
        an item using a power augmented by spending additional <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>, the character’s effective <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>
        for the purpose of calculating the item’s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent.
        (Augmentation is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be amplified in various ways if additional
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> are spent.) All other <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set
        according to the effective <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The price of <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a> (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends on the <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> of the
        power and a character’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>. The character’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> must be high enough that the item
        creator can manifest the power at the chosen <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. To find the final price in each case, multiply the
        character’s <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> by the power <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below.
      </p>

      <p><i><a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-6">Power Stones</a>: </i>Base price = power <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> × <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> × 25 gp</p>

      <p><i><a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">Psionic Tattoos</a>: </i>Base price = power <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> × <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> × 50 gp</p>

      <p><i>Dorjes: </i>Base price = power <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a> × <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> × 750 gp</p>

      <p>
        <b>Extra Costs:</b> Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a
        commensurate cost.
      </p>

      <p>
        For <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">psionic tattoos</a> and <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-6">power stones</a>, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the item. For a dorje, the
        creator must pay fifty times the XP cost.
      </p>

      <p>Some <a href="psionic-items.html">psionic items</a> similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p>

      <h3 id="section-0-2"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-0-2">METAPSIONIC FEATS</a></h3>

      <p>
        As a manifester’s <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-5">knowledge</a> of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> grows, he can learn to manifest powers in ways slightly different from
        how the powers were originally designed or learned. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic
        feat is more expensive than manifesting the power normally.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Manifesting Time:</b> Powers manifested using <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-0-2">metapsionic feats</a> take the same time as manifesting the powers
        normally unless the feat description specifically says otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Manifestation Cost:</b> To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic character must both expend his psionic focus
        (see the <a href="skills-i.html#section-3-6">Concentration</a> skill description) and pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat
        description.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Limits on Use:</b> As with all powers, you cannot spend more <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> on a power than your manifester
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>. <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-0-2">Metapsionic feats</a> merely let you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate this
        rule.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Effects of Metapsionic Feats on a Power:</b> In all ways, a metapsionic power operates at its original power
        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>, even though it costs additional <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a>. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic feat
        have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can’t use a metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast
        from a power stone, dorje, or other device.
      </p>

      <p>Manifesting a power modified by the <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-64">Quicken Power</a> feat does not provoke <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>

      <p>Some <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-0-2">metapsionic feats</a> apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific feat entry.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Psionic Items and Metapsionic Powers:</b> With the right psionic item creation feat, you can store a
        metapsionic power in a power stone, psionic tattoo, or dorje. <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">Level</a> limits for <a href="psionic-items.html#section-1-8">psionic tattoos</a> apply to the
        power’s higher metapsionic <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4">level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A character doesn’t need the appropriate metapsionic feat to activate an item in which a metapsionic power is
        stored, but does need the metapsionic feat to create such an item.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section-1"><a href="feats.html#section-3">FEAT DESCRIPTIONS</a></h2>

      <p>These <a href="feats.html#section-3">feat descriptions</a> follow the standard format.</p>

      <h3 id="section-1-1"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-1">ALIGNED ATTACK</a> <small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3>

      <p>
        Your melee or ranged attack overcomes your opponent’s <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>-based <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a> and deals additional
        <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>.
      </p>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> +6.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When you take this feat, choose either chaos, good, evil or law. (Your choice must match one of
        your <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a> <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-5">components</a>. Once you’ve made this <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment </a> choice, it cannot be changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. When you make a successful melee or ranged attack, you
        deal an extra 1d6 points of <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>, and your attack is treated as either a good, evil, chaotic, or lawful attack
        (depending on your original choice) for the purpose of overcoming <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-7">damage reduction</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still
        expend your psionic focus.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-2"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-2">ANTIPSIONIC MAGIC</a> <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>Your <a href="epic-skills.html#section-3-1">spells</a> are more potent when used against psionic characters and creatures.</p>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> <a href="epic-skills.html#section-1-30">Spellcraft</a> 5 ranks.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You get a get a +2 bonus on <a href="magic-overview.html#section-1-4">caster level</a><a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-4"></a> checks made to overcome a psionic creature’s power
        <a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68">resistance</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This bonus stacks with the bonus conferred by <a href="feats.html#section-3-95">Spell Penetration</a> and <a href="feats.html#section-3-40">Greater Spell Penetration</a><a href="feats.html#section-3-95"></a>. Moreover,
        whenever a psionic creature attempts to dispel a spell you cast, it makes its <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> check against a
        DC of 13 + its <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <p>The benefits of this feat apply only to <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-11">power resistance</a><a href="spells-p-r.html#section-0-68"></a>.</p>

      <p>The bonus does not apply to <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-31">spell resistance</a>. This is an exception to the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>–magic transparency rule.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power
        point reserve or <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-4">psi-like abilities</a>).
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-3"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-3">AUTONOMOUS</a> <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>You have a knack for psionic self-sufficiency.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-1">Autohypnosis</a> checks and <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-3">Knowledge (psionics) </a> checks.</p>

      <h3 id="section-1-4"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-4">BODY FUEL</a> <small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3>

      <p>You can expand your power point total at the expense of your health.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can recover 2 <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> by taking 1 point of ability burn <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to each of your three
        <a href="basics-and-ability-scores.html#section-1">ability scores</a>: Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can recover additional <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> for a proportional cost to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. These
        recovered points are added to your power point reserve as if you had gained them by resting overnight.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> Only living creatures can use this feat. You can take advantage of this feat only while in your
        own body.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-5"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-5">BOOST CONSTRUCT</a> <small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3>

      <p>Your astral constructs have more abilities.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When you create an <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-8">astral construct</a>, you can give it one additional special ability from any
        menu that the construct currently has an ability from.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-6"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-6">BURROWING POWER</a> <small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3>

      <p>Your powers sometimes bypass barriers.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can attempt to manifest your powers
        against targets that are sheltered behind a wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through the Astral
        Plane to bypass the barrier.
      </p>

      <p>
        The strength and thickness of the barrier determine your chance of success. To successfully bypass the barrier
        with your power, you make a <a href="psionic-skills.html#section-1-4">Psicraft</a> check against a DC equal to 10 + the hardness of the barrier + 1 per foot
        of thickness (minimum 1). Assign a hardness of 20 to barriers without a hardness rating, such as force effects
        (or a <i>wall of ectoplasm</i>). Force <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-3">walls</a> or <i><a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-3">walls</a> of ectoplasm </i>are assumed to have less than 1 foot
        of thickness unless noted otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a power requires line of sight (which includes most powers that affect a target or targets instead of an
        area), you cannot manifest it as a <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-6">burrowing power</a> unless you can somehow see the target, such as with
        <i>clairvoyant sense</i>. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power’s total
        cost cannot exceed your <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-7"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-7">CHAIN POWER</a> <small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3>

      <p>You can manifest powers that arc to hit other targets in addition to the primary target.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can chain any power that affects a
        single target and that deals either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a>. After the primary target is
        struck, the power can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a> (maximum twenty). The
        secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half as much <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> as the primary one did (round down).
      </p>

      <p>
        Each target gets to make a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a>, if one is allowed by the power. You choose secondary targets as you
        like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You
        can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example).
      </p>

      <p>
        Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-8"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-8">CHAOTIC MIND</a> <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>The turbulence of your thoughts prevents others from gaining insight into your actions.</p>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Chaotic <a href="alignment-and-description.html#section-1">alignment</a>, Cha 15.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Creatures and characters who have an insight bonus on their attack rolls, an insight bonus to
        their <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-4">Armor Class</a>, or an insight bonus on <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-1">skill checks</a> or <a href="skills-i.html#section-2-3">ability checks</a> do not gain those bonuses against you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The benefit of this feat applies only to insight bonuses gained from <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-3">psionic powers </a> and <a href="psionic-monsters.html#section-0-4">psi-like abilities</a>. This
        is an exception to the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>–magic transparency rule.

      <p>You can manifest powers that go off up to 5 rounds later.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can manifest a power as a delayed
        power. A delayed power doesn’t activate immediately. When you manifest the power, you choose one of three
        trigger mechanisms: (1) The power activates when you take a standard action to activate it; (2) It activates
        when a creature enters the area that the power will affect (only powers that affect areas can use this trigger
        condition); or (3) It activates on your turn after 5 rounds pass. If you choose one of the first two triggers
        and the <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a> are not met within 5 rounds, the power activates automatically on the fifth round.
      </p>

      <p>Only area and personal powers can be delayed.</p>

      <p>
        Any decisions you would make about the delayed power, including attack rolls, designating targets, or
        determining or shaping an area, are decided when the power is manifested. Any effects resolved by those affected
        by the power, including <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a>, are decided when the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-1">delay</a> period ends.

      <p>
        A <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-1">delay</a>ed power can be dispelled normally during the <a href="combat-ii-movement-modifiers-and-special-actions.html#section-4-1">delay</a>, and can be detected normally in the area or on the
        target by the use of powers that can detect psionic effects.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can empower a power. All variable, numeric effects of an empowered power are increased by one-half. An
        empowered power deals half again as much <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> as normal, cures half again as many <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-5">hit points</a>, affects half
        again as many targets, and so forth, as appropriate. Augmented powers can also be empowered (multiply 1-1/2
        times the <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> total of the augmented power). <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">Saving throws</a> and opposed checks (such as the one you make when

      </p>

      <p>
        Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your

        targets one or more creatures. Scribing a psionic tattoo takes one day. When you create a psionic tattoo, you

        gp. To scribe a tattoo, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials (special inks,
        masterwork needles, and so on) costing one-half of this base price.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you create a psionic tattoo, you make any choices that you would normally make when manifesting the power.
      </p>

      <p>When its wearer physically activates the tattoo, the wearer is the target of the power.</p>

      <p>
        Any psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the

        <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-9">duration</a>, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of the resulting powers. The target experiences
        all the effects of both powers individually and receives a <a href="magic-overview.html#section-2-10">saving throw</a> (if applicable) for each. In some cases,
        such as a twinned <i>psionic charm</i>, failing both <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-7">saving throws</a> results in redundant effects (although, in
        this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the
        charm effect).
      </p>

      <p>
        Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.

      <h3 id="section-1-75"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-75">UNAVOIDABLE STRIKE</a> <small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3>

      <p>You can make an unarmed strike or use a natural weapon against your foe as if delivering a touch attack.</p>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Str 13, <a href="psionic-classes.html#section-9">Psionic Fist</a>, base <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-2">attack bonus</a> +5.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can resolve your unarmed strike or
        attack with a natural weapon as a touch attack.
      </p>

      <p>
        You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still
        expend your psionic focus.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-76"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-76">UNCONDITIONAL POWER</a> <small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3>

      <p>Disabling <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a> do not hold you back.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Your mental strength is enough to overcome
        some otherwise disabling <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-2">conditions</a>. You can manifest an <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-76">unconditional power</a> when you are dazed,
        <i>confused, </i>nauseated, shaken, or stunned.
      </p>

      <p>Only personal powers and powers that affect your person can be manifested as unconditional powers.</p>

      <p>
        Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 8. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.

      <h3 id="section-1-77"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-77">UP THE WALLS</a><a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-3"></a> <small>[PSIONIC]</small></h3>

      <p>You can <a href="feats.html#section-3-84">run</a> on <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-3">walls</a> for brief distances.</p>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Wis 13.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> While you are psionically focused, you can take part of one of your <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-4">move actions</a> to traverse a
        wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if you begin and end your move on a horizontal surface. The
        height you can achieve on the wall is limited only by this <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a> restriction. If you do not end your move on
        a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking <a href="wilderness-weather-and-environment.html#section-9-4">falling</a> <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> as appropriate for your distance above the ground.
        Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of measuring your <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>. Passing from floor to wall or wall
        to floor costs no <a href="carrying-movement-and-exploration.html#section-2">movement</a>; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can make attacks of
        opportunity as you move up the wall.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> You can take other <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-5-4">move actions</a> in conjunction with moving along a wall. For instance, the
        <a href="feats.html#section-3-97">Spring Attack</a> feat allows you to make an attack from the wall against a foe standing on the ground who is within
        the area you threaten; however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your move, you fall. Likewise, you
        could <a href="skills-ii.html#section-0-20">tumble</a> along the wall to avoid <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-4">attacks of opportunity</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-78"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-78">WIDEN POWER</a> <small>[METAPSIONIC]</small></h3>

      <p>You can increase the area of your powers.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can alter a <a href="psionic-powers-a-c.html#section-0-27">burst</a>, emanation, line, or
        spread-shaped power to increase its area. (Powers that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not
        affected by this feat.) Any numeric measurements of the power’s area increase by 100%.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your
        <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-0-4">manifester level</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section-1-79"><a href="psionic-feats.html#section-1-79">WILD TALENT</a> <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>Your mind wakes to a previously unrealized talent for <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a>.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Your latent power of <a href="special-abilities-and-conditions.html#section-1-26">psionics</a> flares to life, conferring upon you the designation of a psionic
        character. As a psionic character, you gain a reserve of 2 <a href="psionic-powers-overview.html#section-4-12">power points</a> and can take <a href="psionic-feats.html">psionic feats</a>, metapsionic
        <a href="feats.html">feats</a>, and <a href="psionic-feats.html#section-0-1">psionic item creation feats</a>. You do not, however, gain the ability to manifest powers simply by
        <a href="spells-t-z.html#section-0-34">virtue</a> of having this feat.

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can make an attack with such vicious
        force that you wound your opponent. A wound deals 1 point of Constitution <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> to your foe in addition to the
        usual <a href="combat-i-basics.html#section-2-3">damage</a> dealt.

      <p>
        You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still
