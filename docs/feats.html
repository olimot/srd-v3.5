      <h1>FEATS</h1>

      <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>

      <p>
        Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated ability score, class feature, feat, skill,
        base attack bonus, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain a feat
        at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.
      </p>

      <p>A character can’t use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.</p>

      <h2>TYPES OF FEATS</h2>

      <p>
        Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are item creation feats,
        which allow spellcasters to create magic items of all sorts. A metamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare and
        cast a spell with greater effect, albeit as if the spell were a higher spell level than it actually is.
      </p>

      <h3>FIGHTER BONUS FEATS</h3>

      <p>
        Any feat designated as a fighter feat can be selected as a fighter’s bonus feat. This designation does not
        restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming that they meet any prerequisites.
      </p>

      <h3>ITEM CREATION FEATS</h3>

      <p>
        An item creation feat lets a spellcaster create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items
        they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>XP Cost:</b> Experience that the spellcaster would normally keep is expended when making a magic item. The XP
        cost equals 1/25 of the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he
        or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP
        on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.
      </p>

      <p><b>Raw Materials Cost:</b> The cost of creating a magic item equals one-half the sale cost of the item.</p>

      <p>
        Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so on.
        A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Time:</b> The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is
        one day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Item Cost:</b> Brew Potion, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll create items that directly reproduce spell effects,
        and the power of these items depends on their caster level—that is, a spell from such an item has the power it
        would have if cast by a spellcaster of that level. The price of these items (and thus the XP cost and the cost
        of the raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level must be high enough that the
        spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply
        the caster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:
      </p>

      <p><i>Scrolls: </i>Base price = spell level × caster level × 25 gp.</p>

      <p><i>Potions: </i>Base price = spell level × caster level × 50 gp.</p>

      <p><i>Wands: </i>Base price = spell level × caster level × 750 gp.</p>

      <p>A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the purpose of this calculation.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Extra Costs: </b>Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP
        cost also carries a commensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component
        or pay the XP cost when creating the item.
      </p>

      <p>For a wand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.</p>

      <p>Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p>

      <h3>METAMAGIC FEATS</h3>

      <p>
        As a spellcaster’s knowledge of magic grows, she can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the
        ways in which the spells were originally designed or learned. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is
        harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, at least it is possible.&nbsp; Spells modified by a metamagic
        feat use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the DC for saving
        throws against it does not go up.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Wizards and Divine Spellcasters:</b> Wizards and divine spellcasters must prepare their spells in advance.
        During preparation, the character chooses which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and thus which ones take
        up higher-level spell slots than normal).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Sorcerers and Bards:</b> Sorcerers and bards choose spells as they cast them. They can choose when they cast
        their spells whether to apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved
        spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. But because the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a
        metamagic form in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the spot. Therefore, such a character must also
        take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast a regular
        spell. If the spell’s normal casting time is 1 action, casting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a
        sorcerer or bard. (This isn’t the same as a 1-round casting time.)
      </p>

      <p>For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats: </b>A cleric spontaneously casting a <i>cure </i>or
        <i>inflict </i>spell can cast a metamagic version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case.
        Casting a 1-action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a longer casting time
        takes an extra full-round action to cast.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell:</b> In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell
        level, even though it is prepared and cast as a higher-level spell. Saving throw modifications are not changed
        unless stated otherwise in the feat description.
      </p>

      <p>
        The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can’t
        use a metamagic feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.
      </p>

      <p>
        Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don’t eliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by
        casting a spell while threatened. However, casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack
        of opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific feat descriptions for the spells that a
        particular feat can’t modify.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell:</b> A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell.
        Changes to its level are cumulative. You can’t apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Magic Items and Metamagic Spells:</b> With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of
        a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell’s higher spell level
        (after the application of the metamagic feat). A character doesn’t need the metamagic feat to activate an item
        storing a metamagic version of a spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Counterspelling Metamagic Spells:</b> Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not
        affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell.
      </p>

      <h2>FEAT DESCRIPTIONS</h2>

      <p>Here is the format for feat descriptions.</p>

      <h3>FEAT NAME <small>[TYPE OF FEAT]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Prerequisite:</b> A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum
        number of ranks in one or more skills, or a class level that a character must have in order to acquire this
        feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisite. A feat may have more than one prerequisite.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> What the feat enables the character (“you” in the feat description) to do. If a character has
        the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.
      </p>

      <p>In general, having a feat twice is the same as having it once.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not
        having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special: </b>Additional facts about the feat that may be helpful when you decide whether to acquire the feat.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special: </b>The master of a familiar gains the benefit of the Alertness feat whenever the familiar is within
        arm’s reach.
      </p>

      <h3>ANIMAL AFFINITY <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Handle Animal checks and Ride checks.</p>

      <h3>ARMOR PROFICIENCY (HEAVY) <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Armor Proficiency (light), Armor Proficiency (medium).</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> See Armor Proficiency (light).</p>

      <p><b>Normal:</b> See Armor Proficiency (light).</p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> Fighters, paladins, and clerics automatically have Armor Proficiency (heavy) as a bonus feat.
        They need not select it.
      </p>

      <h3>ARMOR PROFICIENCY (LIGHT) <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When you wear a type of armor with which you are proficient, the armor check penalty for that
        armor applies only to Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble
        checks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> A character who is wearing armor with which she is not proficient applies its armor check penalty
        to attack rolls and to all skill checks that involve moving, including Ride.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> All characters except wizards, sorcerers, and monks automatically have Armor Proficiency (light)
        as a bonus feat. They need not select it.
      </p>

      <h3>ARMOR PROFICIENCY (MEDIUM) <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Armor Proficiency (light).</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> See Armor Proficiency (light).</p>

      <p><b>Normal:</b> See Armor Proficiency (light).</p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> Fighters, barbarians, paladins, clerics, druids, and bards automatically have Armor Proficiency
        (medium) as a bonus feat. They need not select it.
      </p>

      <h3>ATHLETIC <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Climb checks and Swim checks.</p>

      <h3>AUGMENT SUMMONING <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Spell Focus (conjuration).</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Each creature you conjure with any <i>summon </i>spell gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength
        and Constitution for the duration of the spell that summoned it.
      </p>

      <h3>BLIND-FIGHT <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> In melee, every time you miss because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance percentile
        roll one time to see if you actually hit.
      </p>

      <p>
        An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don’t lose your Dexterity
        bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn’t get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible
        attacker’s bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however.
      </p>

      <p>
        You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see. Darkness and poor visibility in general
        reduces your speed to three-quarters normal, instead of one-half.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying to hit you apply, and you lose your
        Dexterity bonus to AC. The speed reduction for darkness and poor visibility also applies.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> The Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a
        <i>blink </i>spell.
      </p>

      <p>A fighter may select Blind-Fight as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>BREW POTION <small>[ITEM CREATION]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Caster level 3rd.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or
        more creatures. Brewing a potion takes one day. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must
        be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a potion is its
        spell level × its caster level × 50 gp. To brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use
        up raw materials costing one half this base price.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever
        drinks the potion is the target of the spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.
        In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when
        creating the potion.
      </p>

      <h3>CLEAVE <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Str 13, Power Attack.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> If you deal a creature enough damage to make it drop (typically by dropping it to below 0 hit
        points or killing it), you get an immediate, extra melee attack against another creature within reach. You
        cannot take a 5-foot step before making this extra attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and at the
        same bonus as the attack that dropped the previous creature. You can use this ability once per round.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Cleave as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>COMBAT CASTING <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You get a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability
        while on the defensive or while you are grappling or pinned.
      </p>

      <h3>COMBAT EXPERTISE <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Int 13.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When you use the attack action or the full attack action in melee, you can take a penalty of as
        much as –5 on your attack roll and add the same number (+5 or less) as a dodge bonus to your Armor Class. This
        number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The changes to attack rolls and Armor Class last until your next
        action.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> A character without the Combat Expertise feat can fight defensively while using the attack or
        full attack action to take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Combat Expertise as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>COMBAT REFLEXES <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You may make a number of additional attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus.</p>

      <p>With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> A character without this feat can make only one attack of opportunity per round and can’t make
        attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> The Combat Reflexes feat does not allow a rogue to use her opportunist ability more than once
        per round.
      </p>

      <p>A fighter may select Combat Reflexes as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <p>A monk may select Combat Reflexes as a bonus feat at 2nd level.</p>

      <h3>CRAFT MAGIC ARMS AND ARMOR <small>[ITEM CREATION]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can create any magic weapon, armor, or shield whose prerequisites you meet. Enhancing a
        weapon, suit of armor, or shield takes one day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its magical features. To
        enhance a weapon, suit of armor, or shield, you must spend 1/25 of its features’ total price in XP and use up
        raw materials costing one-half of this total price.
      </p>

      <p>
        The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included
        in the above cost.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also mend a broken magic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you could make. Doing so
        costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to craft that item in the first
        place.
      </p>

      <h3>CRAFT ROD <small>[ITEM CREATION]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Caster level 9th.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can create any rod whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a rod takes one day for each 1,000
        gp in its base price. To craft a rod, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials
        costing one-half of its base price.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some rods incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in
        addition to those derived from the rod’s base price.
      </p>

      <h3>CRAFT STAFF <small>[ITEM CREATION]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Caster level 12th.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You can create any staff whose prerequisites you meet.</p>

      <p>
        Crafting a staff takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a staff, you must spend 1/25 of its
        base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price. A newly created staff has 50
        charges.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some staffs incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in
        addition to those derived from the staff ’s base price.
      </p>

      <h3>CRAFT WAND <small>[ITEM CREATION]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can create a wand of any 4th-level or lower spell that you know. Crafting a wand takes one
        day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a wand is its caster level × the spell level × 750
        gp. To craft a wand, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of
        this base price. A newly created wand has 50 charges.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In
        addition to the cost derived from the base price, you must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay
        fifty times the XP cost.
      </p>

      <h3>CRAFT WONDROUS ITEM <small>[ITEM CREATION]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Caster level 3rd.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can create any wondrous item whose prerequisites you meet. Enchanting a wondrous item takes
        one day for each 1,000 gp in its price. To enchant a wondrous item, you must spend 1/25 of the item’s price in
        XP and use up raw materials costing half of this price.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also mend a broken wondrous item if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the
        raw materials, and half the time it would take to craft that item in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some wondrous items incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs
        are in addition to those derived from the item’s base price. You must pay such a cost to create an item or to
        mend a broken one.
      </p>

      <h3>DECEITFUL <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Disguise checks and Forgery checks.</p>

      <h3>DEFLECT ARROWS <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 13, Improved Unarmed Strike.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you
        would normally be hit with a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be
        aware of the attack and not flatfooted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn’t count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons and ranged
        attacks generated by spell effects can’t be deflected.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> A monk may select Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat at 2nd level, even if she does not meet the
        prerequisites.
      </p>

      <p>A fighter may select Deflect Arrows as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>DEFT HANDS <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Sleight of Hand checks and Use Rope checks.</p>

      <h3>DIEHARD <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Endurance.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When reduced to between –1 and –9 hit points, you automatically become stable. You don’t have to
        roll d% to see if you lose 1 hit point each round.
      </p>

      <p>
        When reduced to negative hit points, you may choose to act as if you were disabled, rather than dying. You must
        make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn’t your turn). If you do not
        choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall unconscious.
      </p>

      <p>
        When using this feat, you can take either a single move or standard action each turn, but not both, and you
        cannot take a full round action. You can take a move action without further injuring yourself, but if you
        perform any standard action (or any other action deemed as strenuous, including some free actions, such as
        casting a quickened spell) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act. If you reach –10 hit points, you
        immediately die.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> A character without this feat who is reduced to between –1 and –9 hit points is unconscious and
        dying.
      </p>

      <h3>DILIGENT <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Appraise checks and Decipher Script checks.</p>

      <h3>DODGE <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Dex 13.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> During your action, you designate an opponent and receive a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class
        against attacks from that opponent. You can select a new opponent on any action.
      </p>

      <p>
        A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
        Also, dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most other types of bonuses.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Dodge as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>EMPOWER SPELL <small>[METAMAGIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by one-half.</p>

      <p>
        Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. An empowered spell
        uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual level.
      </p>

      <h3>ENDURANCE <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You gain a +4 bonus on the following checks and saves: Swim checks made to resist nonlethal
        damage, Constitution checks made to continue running, Constitution checks made to avoid nonlethal damage from a
        forced march, Constitution checks made to hold your breath, Constitution checks made to avoid nonlethal damage
        from starvation or thirst, Fortitude saves made to avoid nonlethal damage from hot or cold environments, and
        Fortitude saves made to resist damage from suffocation. Also, you may sleep in light or medium armor without
        becoming fatigued.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> A character without this feat who sleeps in medium or heavier armor is automatically fatigued the
        next day.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A ranger automatically gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level. He need not select it.</p>

      <h3>ENLARGE SPELL <small>[METAMAGIC]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can alter a spell with a range of close, medium, or long to increase its range by 100%. An
        enlarged spell with a range of close now has a range of 50 ft. + 5 ft./level, while medium-range spells have a
        range of 200 ft. + 20 ft./level and long-range spells have a range of 800 ft. + 80 ft./level. An enlarged spell
        uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spells whose ranges are not defined by distance, as well as spells whose ranges are not close, medium, or long,
        do not have increased ranges.
      </p>

      <h3>ESCHEW MATERIALS <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can cast any spell that has a material component costing 1 gp or less without needing that
        component. (The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.) If the spell requires a
        material component that costs more than 1 gp, you must have the material component at hand to cast the spell,
        just as normal.
      </p>

      <h3>EXOTIC WEAPON PROFICIENCY <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>Choose a type of exotic weapon. You understand how to use that type of exotic weapon in combat.</p>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Base attack bonus +1 (plus Str 13 for bastard sword or dwarven waraxe).</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You make attack rolls with the weapon normally.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> A character who uses a weapon with which he or she is not proficient takes a –4 penalty on attack
        rolls.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> You can gain Exotic Weapon Proficiency multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies
        to a new type of exotic weapon. Proficiency with the bastard sword or the dwarven waraxe has an additional
        prerequisite of Str 13.
      </p>

      <p>A fighter may select Exotic Weapon Proficiency as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>EXTEND SPELL <small>[METAMAGIC]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> An extended spell lasts twice as long as normal. A spell with a duration of concentration,
        instantaneous, or permanent is not affected by this feat. An extended spell uses up a spell slot one level
        higher than the spell’s actual level.
      </p>

      <h3>EXTRA TURNING <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Ability to turn or rebuke creatures.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Each time you take this feat, you can use your ability to turn or rebuke creatures four more
        times per day than normal.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have the ability to turn or rebuke more than one kind of creature each of your turning or rebuking
        abilities gains four additional uses per day.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, a character can typically turn or rebuke undead (or other creatures) a number
        of times per day equal to 3 + his or her Charisma modifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> You can gain Extra Turning multiple times. Its effects stack. Each time you take the feat, you
        can use each of your turning or rebuking abilities four additional times per day.
      </p>

      <h3>FAR SHOT <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Point Blank Shot.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When you use a projectile weapon, such as a bow, its range increment increases by one-half
        (multiply by 1-1/2). When you use a thrown weapon, its range increment is doubled.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Far Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>FORGE RING <small>[ITEM CREATION]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Caster level 12th.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can create any ring whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a ring takes one day for each
        1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a ring, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw
        materials costing one-half of its base price.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also mend a broken ring if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw
        materials, and half the time it would take to forge that ring in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some magic rings incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. You must pay
        such a cost to forge such a ring or to mend a broken one.
      </p>

      <h3>GREAT CLEAVE <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Str 13, Cleave, Power Attack, base attack bonus +4.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> This feat works like Cleave, except that there is no limit to the number of times you can use it
        per round.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Great Cleave as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>GREAT FORTITUDE <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saving throws.</p>

      <h3>GREATER SPELL FOCUS <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>Choose a school of magic to which you already have applied the Spell Focus feat.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against spells from the school of magic you
        select. This bonus stacks with the bonus from Spell Focus.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it
        applies to a new school of magic to which you already have applied the Spell Focus feat.
      </p>

      <h3>GREATER SPELL PENETRATION <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Spell Penetration.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on caster level checks (1d20 + caster level) made to overcome a creature’s
        spell resistance. This bonus stacks with the one from Spell Penetration.
      </p>

      <h3>GREATER TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 19, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon Fighting, base attack bonus +11.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a third attack with your off-hand weapon, albeit at a –10 penalty.</p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Greater Two-Weapon Fighting as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <p>
        An 11th-level ranger who has chosen the two-weapon combat style is treated as having Greater Two-Weapon
        Fighting, even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.
      </p>

      <h3>GREATER WEAPON FOCUS <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        Choose one type of weapon for which you have already selected Weapon Focus. You can also choose unarmed strike
        or grapple as your weapon for purposes of this feat.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>&nbsp;Prerequisites:</b> Proficiency with selected weapon, Weapon Focus with selected weapon, fighter level
        8th.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls you make using the selected weapon. This bonus stacks
        with other bonuses on attack rolls, including the one from Weapon Focus (see below).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> You can gain Greater Weapon Focus multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take
        the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.
      </p>

      <p>
        A fighter must have Greater Weapon Focus with a given weapon to gain the Greater Weapon Specialization feat for
        that weapon.
      </p>

      <p>A fighter may select Greater Weapon Focus as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>GREATER WEAPON SPECIALIZATION <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        Choose one type of weapon for which you have already selected Weapon Specialization. You can also choose unarmed
        strike or grapple as your weapon for purposes of this feat.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>&nbsp;Prerequisites:</b> Proficiency with selected weapon, Greater Weapon Focus with selected weapon, Weapon
        Focus with selected weapon, Weapon Specialization with selected weapon, fighter level 12th.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You gain a +2 bonus on all damage rolls you make using the selected weapon. This bonus stacks
        with other bonuses on damage rolls, including the one from Weapon Specialization (see below).
      </p>

      <p>

        you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.
      </p>

      <p>A fighter may select Greater Weapon Specialization as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>HEIGHTEN SPELL <small>[METAMAGIC]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up to a maximum of 9th level). Unlike
        other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell actually increases the effective level of the spell that it modifies. All
        effects dependent on spell level (such as saving throw DCs and ability to penetrate a
        <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i>) are calculated according to the heightened level. The heightened spell
        is as difficult to prepare and cast as a spell of its effective level.
      </p>

      <h3>IMPROVED BULL RUSH <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Str 13, Power Attack.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When you perform a bull rush you do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender. You
        also gain a +4 bonus on the opposed Strength check you make to push back the defender.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Improved Bull Rush as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>IMPROVED COUNTERSPELL <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit: </b>When counterspelling, you may use a spell of the same school that is one or more spell levels
        higher than the target spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, you may counter a spell only with the same spell or with a spell specifically
        designated as countering the target spell.
      </p>

      <h3>IMPROVED CRITICAL <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>Choose one type of weapon.</p>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Proficient with weapon, base attack bonus +8.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> When using the weapon you selected, your threat range is doubled.</p>

        feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.
      </p>

      <p>This effect doesn’t stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.</p>

      <p>A fighter may select Improved Critical as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>IMPROVED DISARM <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Int 13, Combat Expertise.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when you attempt to disarm an opponent, nor does the
        opponent have a chance to disarm you. You also gain a +4 bonus on the opposed attack roll you make to disarm
        your opponent.
      </p>

      <p><b>Normal:</b> See the normal disarm rules.</p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Improved Disarm as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <p>
        A monk may select Improved Disarm as a bonus feat at 6th level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.
      </p>

      <h3>IMPROVED FAMILIAR <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        This feat allows spellcasters to acquire a new familiar from a nonstandard list, but only when they could
        normally acquire a new familiar.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Prerequisites:</b> Ability to acquire a new familiar, compatible alignment, sufficiently high level (see
        below).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When choosing a familiar, the creatures listed below are also available to the spellcaster. The
        spellcaster may choose a familiar with an alignment up to one step away on each of the alignment axes (lawful

      </p>

      <p>
        Improved familiars otherwise use the rules for regular familiars<i>, </i>with two exceptions: If the creature’s
        type is something other than animal, its type does not change; and improved familiars do not gain the ability to
        speak with other creatures of their kind (although many of them already have the ability to communicate).
      </p>

      <p>
        The list in the table above presents only a few possible improved familiars. Almost any creature of the same
        general size and power as those on the list makes a suitable familiar. Nor is the master’s alignment the only
        possible categorization. For instance, improved familiars could be assigned by the master’s creature type or
        subtype, as shown below.

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Int 13, Combat Expertise.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You can make a Bluff check to feint in combat as a move action.</p>

      <h3>IMPROVED GRAPPLE <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 13, Improved Unarmed Strike.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when you make a touch attack to start a grapple. You
        also gain a +4 bonus on all grapple checks, regardless of whether you started the grapple.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, you provoke an attack of opportunity when you make a touch attack to start a
        grapple.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Improved Grapple as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <p>
        A monk may select Improved Grapple as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.
      </p>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Str 13, Power Attack.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When you attempt to overrun an opponent, the target may not choose to avoid you. You also gain a
        +4 bonus on your Strength check to knock down your opponent.

      <h3>IMPROVED PRECISE SHOT <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 19, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, base attack bonus +11.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Your ranged attacks ignore the AC bonus granted to targets by anything less than total cover,
        and the miss chance granted to targets by anything less than total concealment. Total cover and total
        concealment provide their normal benefits against your ranged attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, when you shoot or throw ranged weapons at a grappling opponent, you automatically strike at the
        opponent you have chosen.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> See the normal rules on the effects of cover and concealment. Without this feat, a character who
        shoots or throws a ranged weapon at a target involved in a grapple must roll randomly to see which grappling
        combatant the attack strikes.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Improved Precise Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <p>
        An 11th-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Improved Precise Shot, even if

      </p>

      <h3>IMPROVED SHIELD BASH <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Shield Proficiency.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> When you perform a shield bash, you may still apply the shield’s shield bonus to your AC.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, a character who performs a shield bash loses the shield’s shield bonus to AC
        until his or her next turn.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Improved Shield Bash as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>IMPROVED SUNDER <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Str 13, Power Attack.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When you strike at an object held or carried by an opponent (such as a weapon or shield), you do
        not provoke an attack of opportunity.

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, you provoke an attack of opportunity when you strike at an object held or
        carried by another character.

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when you attempt to trip an opponent while you are
        unarmed. You also gain a +4 bonus on your Strength check to trip your opponent.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you trip an opponent in melee combat, you immediately get a melee attack against that opponent as if you
        hadn’t used your attack for the trip attempt.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, you provoke an attack of opportunity when you attempt to trip an opponent
        while you are unarmed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> At 6th level, a monk may select Improved Trip as a bonus feat, even if she does not have the
        prerequisites.
      </p>

      <p>A fighter may select Improved Trip as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>IMPROVED TURNING <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Ability to turn or rebuke creatures.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You turn or rebuke creatures as if you were one level higher than you are in the class that
        grants you the ability.

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 17, Two-Weapon Fighting, base attack bonus +6.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> In addition to the standard single extra attack you get with an off-hand weapon, you get a
        second attack with it, albeit at a –5 penalty.
      </p>

      <p><b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, you can only get a single extra attack with an off-hand weapon.</p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Improved Two-Weapon Fighting as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <p>
        A 6th-level ranger who has chosen the two-weapon combat style is treated as having Improved Two-Weapon Fighting,
        even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.
      </p>

      <h3>IMPROVED UNARMED STRIKE <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You are considered to be armed even when unarmed —that is, you do not provoke attacks or
        opportunity from armed opponents when you attack them while unarmed. However, you still get an attack of
        opportunity against any opponent who makes an unarmed attack on you.
      </p>

      <p>In addition, your unarmed strikes can deal lethal or nonlethal damage, at your option.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal: </b>Without this feat, you are considered unarmed when attacking with an unarmed strike, and you can
        deal only nonlethal damage with such an attack.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> A monk automatically gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat at 1st level. She need not

      <h3>LEADERSHIP <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Character level 6th.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefits:</b> Having this feat enables the character to attract loyal companions and devoted followers,
        subordinates who assist her. See the table below for what sort of cohort and how many followers the character
        can recruit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Leadership Modifiers: </b>Several factors can affect a character’s Leadership score, causing it to vary from
        the base score (character level + Cha modifier). A character’s reputation (from the point of view of the cohort
        or follower he is trying to attract) raises or lowers his Leadership score:

      </table>

      <p>
        <i>Leadership Score: </i>A character’s base Leadership score equals his level plus any Charisma modifier. In
        order to take into account negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but
        the character must still be 6th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect
        a character’s Leadership score, as detailed above.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Cohort Level: </i>The character can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of a character’s
        Leadership score, he can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than himself. The cohort should
        be equipped with gear appropriate for its level. A character can try to attract a cohort of a particular race,
        class, and alignment. The cohort’s alignment may not be opposed to the leader’s alignment on either the
        law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis, and the leader takes a Leadership penalty if he recruits a cohort of an
        alignment different from his own.
      </p>

      <p>Cohorts earn XP as follows:</p>

      <p>The cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party’s XP.</p>

      <p>
        Divide the cohort’s level by the level of the PC with whom he or she is associated (the character with the
        Leadership feat who attracted the cohort).
      </p>

      <p>
        Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and add that number of experience points to the cohort’s
        total.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than the associated PC’s character level, the
        cohort does not gain the new level—its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed attain the next level.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Number of Followers by Level: </i>The character can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each
        level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they’re generally low-level NPCs. Because they’re generally five
        or more levels behind the character they follow, they’re rarely effective in combat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Followers don’t earn experience and thus don’t gain levels. However, when a character with Leadership attains a
        new level, the player consults the table above to determine if she has acquired more followers, some of which
        may be higher level than the existing followers. (You don’t consult the table to see if your cohort gains
        levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.)
      </p>

      <h3>LIGHTNING REFLEXES <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Reflex saving throws.</p>

      <h3>MAGICAL APTITUDE <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Spellcraft checks and Use Magic Device checks.</p>

      <h3>MANYSHOT <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 17, Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, base attack bonus +6</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> As a standard action, you may fire two arrows at a single opponent within 30 feet. Both arrows
        use the same attack roll (with a –4 penalty) to determine success and deal damage normally (but see Special).
      </p>

      <p>
        For every five points of base attack bonus you have above +6, you may add one additional arrow to this attack,
        to a maximum of four arrows at a base attack bonus of +16. However, each arrow after the second adds a
        cumulative –2 penalty on the attack roll (for a total penalty of –6 for three arrows and –8 for four).
      </p>

      <p>Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> Regardless of the number of arrows you fire, you apply precision-based damage only once. If you
        score a critical hit, only the first arrow fired deals critical damage; all others deal regular damage.
      </p>

      <p>A fighter may select Manyshot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <p>
        A 6th-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Manyshot even if he does not
        have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.
      </p>

      <h3>MARTIAL WEAPON PROFICIENCY <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>Choose a type of martial weapon. You understand how to use that type of martial weapon in combat.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You make attack rolls with the selected weapon normally.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all martial weapons. They need
        not select this feat.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can gain Martial Weapon Proficiency multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of
        weapon.
      </p>

      <p>
        A cleric who chooses the War domain automatically gains the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat related to his
        deity’s favored weapon as a bonus feat, if the weapon is a martial one. He need not select it.
      </p>

      <h3>MAXIMIZE SPELL <small>[METAMAGIC]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized. Saving throws and
        opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. A maximized spell uses up a spell slot
        three levels higher than the spell’s actual level.
      </p>

      <p>
        An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus one-half the
        normally rolled result.
      </p>

      <h3>MOBILITY <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 13, Dodge.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You get a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out
        of or within a threatened area. A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any)
        also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
      </p>

      <p>Dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.</p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Mobility as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>MOUNTED ARCHERY <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The penalty you take when using a ranged weapon while mounted is halved: –2 instead of –4 if
        your mount is taking a double move, and –4 instead of –8 if your mount is running.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Mounted Archery as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>MOUNTED COMBAT <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Ride 1 rank.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as a reaction) to
        negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Ride check result is greater than the opponent’s attack roll.
        (Essentially, the Ride check result becomes the mount’s Armor Class if it’s higher than the mount’s regular AC.)
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Mounted Combat as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>NATURAL SPELL <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites: </b>Wis 13, wild shape ability.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can complete the verbal and somatic components of spells while in a wild shape. You
        substitute various noises and gestures for the normal verbal and somatic components of a spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also use any material components or focuses you possess, even if such items are melded within your
        current form. This feat does not permit the use of magic items while you are in a form that could not ordinarily
        use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak while in a wild shape.
      </p>

      <h3>NEGOTIATOR <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Diplomacy checks and Sense Motive checks.</p>

      <h3>NIMBLE FINGERS <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Disable Device checks and Open Lock checks.</p>

      <h3>PERSUASIVE <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Bluff checks and Intimidate checks.</p>

      <h3>POINT BLANK SHOT <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Point Blank Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>POWER ATTACK <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Str 13.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> On your action, before making attack rolls for a round, you may choose to subtract a number from
        all melee attack rolls and add the same number to all melee damage rolls. This number may not exceed your base
        attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage apply until your next turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or with a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands,
        instead add twice the number subtracted from your attack rolls. You can’t add the bonus from Power Attack to the
        damage dealt with a light weapon (except with unarmed strikes or natural weapon attacks), even though the
        penalty on attack rolls still applies. (Normally, you treat a double weapon as a one-handed weapon and a light
        weapon. If you choose to use a double weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with only one end of it in a
        round, you treat it as a two-handed weapon.)
      </p>

      <p>A fighter may select Power Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>PRECISE SHOT <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Point Blank Shot.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the
        standard –4 penalty on your attack roll.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Precise Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>QUICK DRAW <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Base attack bonus +1.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a move action. You can draw a hidden weapon
        (see the Sleight of Hand skill) as a move action.
      </p>

      <p>
        A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at his full normal rate of attacks (much like a
        character with a bow).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal: </b>Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or
        higher) as a free action as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard
        action.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Quick Draw as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>QUICKEN SPELL <small>[METAMAGIC]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Casting a quickened spell is a free action. You can perform another action, even casting another
        spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. You may cast only one quickened spell per round. A spell
        whose casting time is more than 1 full round action cannot be quickened. A quickened spell uses up a spell slot
        four levels higher than the spell’s actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn’t provoke an attack of
        opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> This feat can’t be applied to any spell cast spontaneously (including sorcerer spells, bard
        spells, and cleric or druid spells cast spontaneously), since applying a metamagic feat to a spontaneously cast
        spell automatically increases the casting time to a full-round action.
      </p>

      <h3>RAPID RELOAD <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy).</p>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen).</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action
        (for a hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an
        attack of opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a
        full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a
        full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type
        of crossbow.
      </p>

      <p>A fighter may select Rapid Reload as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>RAPID SHOT <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 13, Point Blank Shot.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can get one extra attack per round with a ranged weapon. The attack is at your highest base
        attack bonus, but each attack you make in that round (the extra one and the normal ones) takes a –2 penalty. You
        must use the full attack action to use this feat.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Rapid Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <p>
        A 2nd-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Rapid Shot, even if he does not
        have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.
      </p>

      <h3>RIDE-BY ATTACK <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When you are mounted and use the charge action, you may move and attack as if with a standard
        charge and then move again (continuing the straight line of the charge). Your total movement for the round can’t
        exceed double your mounted speed. You and your mount do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the opponent
        that you attack.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Ride-By Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>RUN <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When running, you move five times your normal speed (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and
        carrying no more than a medium load) or four times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load).
        If you make a jump after a running start (see the Jump skill description), you gain a +4 bonus on your Jump
        check. While running, you retain your Dexterity bonus to AC.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> You move four times your speed while running (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying
        no more than a medium load) or three times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load), and you
        lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.
      </p>

      <h3>SCRIBE SCROLL <small>[ITEM CREATION]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can create a scroll of any spell that you know. Scribing a scroll takes one day for each
        1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a scroll is its spell level × its caster level × 25 gp. To
        scribe a scroll, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this
        base price.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.
        In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when
        scribing the scroll.
      </p>

      <h3>SELF-SUFFICIENT <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Heal checks and Survival checks.</p>

      <h3>SHIELD PROFICIENCY <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You can use a shield and take only the standard penalties.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> When you are using a shield with which you are not proficient, you take the shield’s armor check
        penalty on attack rolls and on all skill checks that involve moving, including Ride checks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> Barbarians, bards, clerics, druids, fighters, paladins, and rangers automatically have Shield
        Proficiency as a bonus feat. They need not select it.
      </p>

      <h3>SHOT ON THE RUN <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility, Point Blank Shot, base attack bonus +4.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When using the attack action with a ranged weapon, you can move both before and after the
        attack, provided that your total distance moved is not greater than your speed.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Shot on the Run as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>SILENT SPELL <small>[METAMAGIC]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> A silent spell can be cast with no verbal components. Spells without verbal components are not
        affected. A silent spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> Bard spells cannot be enhanced by this metamagic feat.</p>

      <h3>SIMPLE WEAPON PROFICIENCY <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You make attack rolls with simple weapons normally.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> All characters except for druids, monks, and wizards are automatically proficient with all
        simple weapons. They need not select this feat.
      </p>

      <h3>SKILL FOCUS <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>Choose a skill.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +3 bonus on all checks involving that skill.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it
        applies to a new skill.
      </p>

      <h3>SNATCH ARROWS <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 15, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed Strike.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When using the Deflect Arrows feat you may catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it.
        Thrown weapons can immediately be thrown back at the original attacker (even though it isn’t your turn) or kept
        for later use.
      </p>

      <p>You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.</p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Snatch Arrows as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>SPELL FOCUS <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>Choose a school of magic.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against spells from the school of magic you
        select.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it
        applies to a new school of magic.
      </p>

      <h3>SPELL MASTERY <small>[SPECIAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wizard level 1st.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Each time you take this feat, choose a number of spells equal to your Intelligence modifier that
        you already know. From that point on, you can prepare these spells without referring to a spellbook.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal: </b>Without this feat, you must use a spellbook to prepare all your spells, except <i>read magic.</i>
      </p>

      <h3>SPELL PENETRATION <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on caster level checks (1d20 + caster level) made to overcome a creature’s
        spell resistance.
      </p>

      <h3>SPIRITED CHARGE <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat, Ride-By Attack.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When mounted and using the charge action, you deal double damage with a melee weapon (or triple
        damage with a lance).
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Spirited Charge as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>SPRING ATTACK [<small>GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility, base attack bonus +4.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When using the attack action with a melee weapon, you can move both before and after the attack,
        provided that your total distance moved is not greater than your speed. Moving in this way does not provoke an
        attack of opportunity from the defender you attack, though it might provoke attacks of opportunity from other
        creatures, if appropriate. You can’t use this feat if you are wearing heavy armor.
      </p>

      <p>
        You must move at least 5 feet both before and after you make your attack in order to utilize the benefits of
        Spring Attack.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Spring Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>STEALTHY <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Hide checks and Move Silently checks.</p>

      <h3>STILL SPELL <small>[METAMAGIC]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> A stilled spell can be cast with no somatic components.</p>

      <p>
        Spells without somatic components are not affected. A stilled spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than
        the spell’s actual level.
      </p>

      <h3>STUNNING FIST <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed
        attack roll ruins the attempt). Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude
        saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A
        defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before your next action). A stunned
        character can’t act, loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a –2 penalty to AC. You may attempt a stunning
        attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.
        Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be
        stunned.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> A monk may select Stunning Fist as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if she does not meet the
        prerequisites. A monk who selects this feat may attempt a stunning attack a number of times per day equal to her
        monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels she has in classes other than monk.
      </p>

      <p>A fighter may select Stunning Fist as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>TOUGHNESS <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You gain +3 hit points.</p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A character may gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.</p>

      <h3>TOWER SHIELD PROFICIENCY <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Shield Proficiency.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit:</b> You can use a tower shield and suffer only the standard penalties.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> A character who is using a shield with which he or she is not proficient takes the shield’s armor
        check penalty on attack rolls and on all skill checks that involve moving, including Ride.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> Fighters automatically have Tower Shield Proficiency as a bonus feat. They need not select it.
      </p>

      <h3>TRACK <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make
        another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow.
      </p>

      <p>
        You move at half your normal speed (or at your normal speed with a –5 penalty on the check, or at up to twice
        your normal speed with a –20 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions,
        as given on the table below:

        footprints.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Soft Ground: </i>Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in
        which a creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Firm Ground: </i>Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally
        soft or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces
        (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Hard Ground: </i>Any surface that doesn’t hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor. Most
        streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The creature
        leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles).

      <p>If you fail a Survival check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, you can use the Survival skill to find tracks, but you can follow them only if
        the DC for the task is 10 or lower. Alternatively, you can use the Search skill to find a footprint or similar
        sign of a creature’s passage using the DCs given above, but you can’t use Search to follow tracks, even if
        someone else has already found them.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A ranger automatically has Track as a bonus feat. He need not select it.</p>

      <p>
        This feat does not allow you to find or follow the tracks made by a subject of a
        <i>pass without trace </i>spell.
      </p>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> When you attempt to overrun an opponent while mounted, your target may not choose to avoid you.
        Your mount may make one hoof attack against any target you knock down, gaining the standard +4 bonus on attack
        rolls against prone targets.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Trample as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>TWO-WEAPON DEFENSE <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 15, Two-Weapon Fighting.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit: </b>When wielding a double weapon or two weapons (not including natural weapons or unarmed strikes),
        you gain a +1 shield bonus to your AC.
      </p>

      <p>When you are fighting defensively or using the total defense action, this shield bonus increases to +2.</p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Two-Weapon Defense as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> Dex 15.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> Your penalties on attack rolls for fighting with two weapons are reduced. The penalty for your
        primary hand lessens by 2 and the one for your off hand lessens by 6.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Normal:</b> If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that
        weapon. When fighting in this way you suffer a –6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary
        hand and a –10 penalty to the attack with your off hand. If your off-hand weapon is light the penalties are
        reduced by 2 each. (An unarmed strike is always considered light.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Special:</b> A 2nd-level ranger who has chosen the two-weapon combat style is treated as having Two-Weapon
        Fighting, even if he does not have the prerequisite for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.
      </p>

        <b>Benefit:</b> With a light weapon, rapier, whip, or spiked chain made for a creature of your size category,
        you may use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls. If you carry a shield,
        its armor check penalty applies to your attack rolls.
      </p>

        applies to a new type of weapon.
      </p>

      <p>
        A fighter may select Weapon Focus as one of his fighter bonus feats. He must have Weapon Focus with a weapon to
        gain the Weapon Specialization feat for that weapon.
      </p>

      <h3>WEAPON SPECIALIZATION <small>[GENERAL]</small></h3>

      <p>
        Choose one type of weapon for which you have already selected the Weapon Focus feat. You can also choose unarmed

        spells, or abilities.
      </p>

      <p><b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Whirlwind Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

      <h3>WIDEN SPELL <small>[METAMAGIC]</small></h3>

      <p>
        <b>Benefit:</b> You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread shaped spell to increase its area. Any numeric
        measurements of the spell’s area increase by 100%.A widened spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than
        the spell’s actual level.
      </p>
