    <p>
      Any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the warded creature, even with a targeted spell,
      must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting
      of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can’t follow through with the attack, that part of its action is
      lost, and it can’t directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to
      attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or
      affected by area or effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack
      spells or otherwise act.

      A twisting pattern of discordant, coruscating colors weaves through the air, affecting creatures within it. The
      spell affects a total number of Hit Dice of creatures equal to your caster level (maximum 20). Creatures with the
      fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell’s point of
      origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. The spell affects
      each subject according to its Hit Dice.

      You blast your enemies with fiery rays. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond

      points of fire damage.

    <p>
      This spell combines several elements to create a powerful protection from scrying and direct observation. When
      casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell’s area. The illusion created must
      be stated in general terms. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and sound are
      appropriate to the illusion created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Even
      entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care
      to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.

    <p>
      You can see and hear some creature, which may be at any distance. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the
      scrying attempt simply fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of
      physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a
      +5 bonus on its Will save.

      If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and the subject’s immediate surroundings (approximately 10
      feet in all directions of the subject). If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects. In
      addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor:
      <i>detect chaos</i>, <i>detect evil</i>, <i>detect good</i>, <i>detect law</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, and
      <i>message</i>.
    </p>
    <p>If the save succeeds, you can’t attempt to scry on that subject again for at least 24 hours.</p>

      Focusing divine power like a ray of the sun, you project a blast of light from your open palm. You must succeed on
      a ranged touch attack to strike your target. A creature struck by this ray of light takes 1d8 points of damage per
      two caster levels (maximum 5d8). An undead creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6),
      and an undead creature particularly vulnerable to bright light takes 1d8 points of damage per caster level
      (maximum 10d8). A construct or inanimate object takes only 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum

    <p>
      You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as sixty days and can retrieve it at will. The chest can
      contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of the chest’s actual size, which is about 3
      feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply
      fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of
      such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same
      materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The
      replica costs 50 gp.) You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time—even a
      <i>wish</i> spell does not allow more. The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on,
      just as any normal chest can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the
      Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per
      day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not
      even with a <i>wish</i> spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might
      be mounted to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or
      whatever they need to survive.

      You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast. The
      floor is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two
      shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be

      the shelter.

    <p>
      When you cast <i>sepia snake sigil,</i> a small symbol appears in the text of one written work such as a book,
      scroll, or map. The text containing the symbol must be at least twenty-five words long. When anyone reads the text
      containing the symbol, the <i>sepia snake</i> springs into being and strikes the reader, provided there is line of
      effect between the symbol and the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it.
      The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake’s strike. If it succeeds, the
      <i>sepia snake</i> dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud
      noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until
      released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + one day per caster level have elapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain
      spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by
      outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However,
      a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and
      <i>detect magic</i> reveals only that the entire text is magical.

      You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or
      forces. <i>Shadow conjuration</i> can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration
      (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Shadow conjurations</i> are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe
      the <i>shadow conjurations</i> to be real are affected by them at full strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its
      true nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each
      disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special
      effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to
      disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC
      is set according to <i>shadow conjuration</i>’s level (4th) rather than the spell’s normal level. In addition, any
      effect created by <i>shadow conjuration</i> allows spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not.
      Shadow objects or substances have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them.

    <p>Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.</p>
    <p>
      A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it’s
      recognized as shadowy). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature
      that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature’s damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all
      special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected
      character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature’s AC bonuses are one-fifth as large.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature that succeeds on its save sees the
      <i>shadow conjurations</i> as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms.

      Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving

      damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a

    <p>
      To use the <i>shadow walk</i> spell, you must be in an area of shadowy illumination. You and any creature you
      touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders
      the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one
      creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of
      Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by
      stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can’t make out details
      of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end.
      It’s impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying.
      Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10x100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your
      desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10x1,000 feet in the same
      direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to
      the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Shadow walk</i> can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage
      requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of
      the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any creatures touched by you when <i>shadow walk</i> is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane
      of Shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for
      either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the
      Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.

      unless you dismiss them. If the shamblers are created only for guard duty, however, the duration of the spell is
      seven months. In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location. Shamblers
      summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell’s range, which is measured from the point where each first
      appeared.

      lose your own supernatural abilities. You also gain the type of the new form in place of your own. The new form
      does not disorient you. Parts of your body or pieces of equipment that are separated from you do not revert to
      their original forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can become just about anything you are familiar with. You can change form once each round as a free action.
      The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or immediately after it, but not during the

      <i>Shatter</i> creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle, nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid,
      nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Used as an area attack, <i>shatter</i> destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All
      such objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects
      weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition
      are shattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can target <i>shatter</i> against a single solid object, regardless of composition, weighing up
      to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), <i>shatter</i> deals 1d6
      points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.

      A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by
      chaotic creatures, and
      <i>slowing</i> chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike
      <i>protection from chaos</i>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic
      creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as
      <i>protection from chaos</i> does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is
      <i>slowed</i> (Will save negates, as the <i>slow</i> spell, but against <i>shield of law</i>’s save DC).

      This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that some of its
      wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves.
      Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including that dealt by special
      abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you.
      Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as
      <i>charm</i> effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the
      subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you
      because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the
      subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subject.

      Your own nonmagical club or quarterstaff becomes a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls.
      (A quarterstaff gains this enhancement for both ends of the weapon.) It deals damage as if it were two size
      categories larger (a Small club or quarterstaff so transmuted deals 1d8 points of damage, a Medium 2d6, and a
      Large 3d6), +1 for its enhancement bonus. These effects only occur when the weapon is wielded by you. If you do

      creatures). It also causes creatures to be stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds. A creature in the area

      You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each
      dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object’s size by
      four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed
      by a
      <i>shrink item</i> spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid
      surface or by a word of command from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this
      spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Shrink item</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell, in which case the affected object can be

      any. Items in a creature’s possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell

      <i>Simulacrum</i> creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The duplicate creature is partially real and
      formed from ice or snow. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has only one-half of the real
      creature’s levels or Hit Dice (and the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a
      creature of that level or HD). You can’t create a simulacrum of a creature whose Hit Dice or levels exceed twice
      your caster level. You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is. A
      creature familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful Spot check (opposed by the caster’s
      Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive check.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all times the simulacrum remains under your absolute command. No special telepathic link exists, so command
      must be exercised in some other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot increase
      its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 hit points or otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly
      into nothingness. A complex process requiring at least 24 hours, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped
      magical laboratory can repair damage to a simulacrum.

    <p>
      This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine,
      a thong, or a rope. When you cast
      <i>snare</i> upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (Search DC 23 for a character with the
      trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the
      limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then
      straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the
      ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the
      creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength
      check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare breaks
      the loop and ends the spell.

    <p>
      When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the spell’s area is softened. Wet earth becomes
      thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped. You
      affect a 10-footsquare area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at
      that spot. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures are not
      affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast
      spells. A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can’t run or charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed
      and can’t run or charge over the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas
      they may not have been able to affect before.
    </p>
    <p>
      While <i>soften earth and stone</i> does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces
      such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened
      material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure by softening the ground beneath
      it, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed.

    <p>
      This spell functions like <i>fog cloud</i>, but in addition to obscuring sight, the <i>solid fog</i> is so thick
      that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed,
      and it takes a –2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon
      attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into <i>solid fog</i> is slowed, so
      that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6. A creature can’t take a 5-foot
      step while in <i>solid fog.</i>
    </p>
    <p>However, unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Solid fog</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>solid fog</i> dispersed by
      wind reforms in 10 minutes.

      creature has a 50% chance to attack the nearest target each round. (Roll to determine each creature’s behavior
      every round at the beginning of its turn.) A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act
      normally for that round.

    <p>
      Creatures forced by a <i>song of discord</i> to attack their fellows employ all methods at their disposal,
      choosing their deadliest spells and most advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have

      <i>clone, raise dead, reincarnation, resurrection, true resurrection,</i>
      or even a <i>miracle</i> or a <i>wish.</i> Only by destroying the gem or dispelling the spell on the gem can one

    <p>
      You grant the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that you put to
      it. You may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The
      corpse’s knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any).
      Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. If the creature’s alignment was different from yours, the
      corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the corpse has been subject to <i>speak with dead</i> within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast
      this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be
      able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at
      least have a mouth in order to speak at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the
      imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once
      inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however,
      cannot learn new information.

    <p>
      A ghostly, glowing hand shaped from your life force materializes and moves as you desire, allowing you to deliver
      low-level, touch range spells at a distance. On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return when the
      spell ends (even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is destroyed. (The hit points can be healed as normal.)
      For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the
      <i>spectral hand</i>. The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand
      counts normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The hand cannot flank targets like a
      creature can. After it delivers a spell, or if the hand goes beyond the spell range, goes out of your sight, the
      hand returns to you and hovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has improved evasion (half damage on a
      failed Reflex save and no damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an AC of at least 22. Your
      Intelligence modifier applies to the hand’s AC as if it were the hand’s Dexterity modifier. The hand has 1 to 4
      hit points, the same number that you lost in creating it.

    <p>
      The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for every four levels you have. The spells
      must be of 4th level or lower. The warded creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the
      specified spell or spells. Naturally, that immunity doesn’t protect a creature from spells for which spell
      resistance doesn’t apply.
      <i>Spell immunity</i> protects against spells, spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities
      of creatures. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze
      attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain domain or school of spells or a group of spells
      that are similar in effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature can have only one <i>spell immunity</i> or <i>greater spell immunity</i> spell in effect on it at a
      time.

      Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only

      When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is
      partially turned. The subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then
      divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For
      damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a
      proportional chance to be affected.

      If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by

    <p>
      A weapon made of pure force springs into existence and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing
      1d8 force damage per hit, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape
      of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and
      has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you
      designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your
      turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus
      your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage
      creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal
      miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a
      flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon
      goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to
      you and hovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the
      weapon continues to attack the previous round’s target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one
      attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack
      bonus would allow it to. Even if the <i>spiritual weapon</i> is a ranged weapon, use the spell’s range, not the
      weapon’s normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>spiritual weapon</i> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>,
      <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A
      <i>spiritual weapon</i>’s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).
    </p>
    <p>
      If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that
      spell resistance the first time the <i>spiritual weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted,
      the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the
      spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity’s own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity
      gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a
      <i>spiritual weapon</i> of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment
      at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows.

      direction and distance to the creatures and any conditions affecting them: unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered,
      unconscious, dying, nauseated, panicked, stunned, poisoned, diseased, <i>confused,</i> or the like. Once the spell
      has been cast upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as
      they are on the same plane of existence. If a subject leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to
      function for it.

      The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The subject gains damage reduction
      10/adamantine. (It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an
      adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction.) Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster
      level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.

      You gain the ability to speak with stones, which relate to you who or what has touched them as well as revealing

    <p>
      This spell restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The creature must make a
      DC 15 Fortitude save to survive the process. Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell also can convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life
      force unless a life force or magical energy is available. (For example, this spell would turn a stone golem into a
      flesh golem, but an ordinary statue would become a corpse.) You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder
      from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass
      of stone.

      This spell creates an enormous black storm cloud. Lightning and crashing claps of thunder appear within the storm.
      Each creature beneath the cloud must succeed on a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4x10 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not maintain concentration on the spell after casting it, the spell ends. If you continue to
      concentrate, the spell generates additional effects in each following round, as noted below. Each effect occurs
      during your turn.

      and wind gusts reduce visibility. The rain obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5
      feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50%
      miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Speed is reduced by three-quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the
      caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the <i>storm of vengeance</i>’s save DC + the level
      of the spell the caster is trying to cast.

    <p>
      You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or
      two). The <i>suggestion</i> must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the
      creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed
      in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify
      conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell
      duration expires, the activity is not performed.
    </p>
    <p>A very reasonable <i>suggestion</i> causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as –1 or –2).</p>

    <p>
      This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another
      plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best
      of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular
      enemies, or to perform other actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying Summon Monster table. You
      choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar
      travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it
      is a spell of that type.

    <p>
      This spell summons a natural creature. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It
      attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not
      to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar
      travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying Summon Nature’s Ally table.
      You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. All the
      creatures on the table are neutral unless otherwise noted.

      (You may summon the swarm so that it shares the area of other creatures.) If no living creatures are within its

      round. You can call forth one beam per three caster levels (maximum six beams at 18th level). The spell ends when

      This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a
      <i>symbol of death</i> slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined
      total current hit points do not exceed 150. The <i>symbol of death</i> affects the closest creatures first,
      skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the <i>symbol</i> becomes active and glows,
      lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points’ worth of creatures, whichever
      comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the <i>symbol of death</i> is active is subject to its
      effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the
      <i>symbol</i> only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the
      <i>symbol</i> is still active, it must save again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until it is triggered, the <i>symbol of death</i> is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60
      feet). To be effective, a <i>symbol of death</i> must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location.
      Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i>symbol of death</i> ineffective, unless a creature removes the
      covering, in which case the <i>symbol of death</i> works normally.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a default, a <i>symbol of death</i> is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you
      select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal
      bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol
      of death can’t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune).
      Once the spell is cast, a <i>symbol of death</i>’s triggering conditions cannot be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a
      cover over a
      <i>symbol of death</i> to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can’t use a
      <i>symbol of death</i> offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item
      bearing the <i>symbol of death</i> is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot be
      placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire.
      Special conditions for triggering a
      <i>symbol of death</i> can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on
      observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don’t qualify.
    </p>
    <p>
      When scribing a <i>symbol of death</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it
      from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune’s effects so long as
      the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use
      the password again.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also can attune any number of creatures to the
      <i>symbol of death,</i> but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible
      time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large
      group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any
      creature attuned to a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its
      radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbols of death</i>, and thus
      always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>symbol of death</i> with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the
      <i>symbol of death</i> is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>symbol of death</i> can be removed by a successful <i>dispel magic</i> targeted solely on the rune. An
      <i>erase</i> spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of death.</i> Destruction of the surface where a
      <i>symbol of death</i> is inscribed destroys the <i>symbol</i> but also triggers it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Symbol of death</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent
      <i>symbol of death</i> that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for
      10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.

      By attuning yourself to a freestanding structure such you can create a damaging vibration within it. Once it

      the spell’s damage.) You can choose at the time of casting to limit the duration of the spell; otherwise it lasts
      for 1 round/ level. If the spell is cast upon a target that is not freestanding the surrounding stone dissipates
      the effect and no damage occurs.

    <p>
      <i>Sympathetic vibration</i> cannot affect creatures (including constructs). Since a structure is an unattended
      object, it gets no saving throw to resist the effect.

      You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that attract either a specific kind of intelligent

      must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment must be
      named.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures of the specified kind or alignment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or to
      possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. If the save is
      successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6x10 minutes
      later. If this save fails, the affected creature attempts to return to the area or object.
