    <h2 id="telekinesis">Telekinesis</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Transmutation</li>
      <li><strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 5</li>
      <li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</li>
      <li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</li>
      <li><strong>Range:</strong> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</li>
      <li><strong>Target or Targets:</strong> See text</li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration (up to 1 round/ level) or instantaneous; see text</li>
      <li><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates (object) or None; see text</li>
      <li><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (object); see text</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a
      gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Sustained Force:</em> A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level
      (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it
      possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight
      can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The
      spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls
      or stops.
    </p>
    <p>
      An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a
      key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might
      even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Combat Maneuver:</em> Alternatively, once per round, you can use <i>telekinesis</i> to perform a bull rush,
      disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don’t provoke attacks
      of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use
      your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or
      Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn’t allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or
      trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell
      can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Violent Thrust:</em> Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object
      or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any
      target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster
      level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).
    </p>
    <p>
      You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your
      base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause
      standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used
      in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6
      points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and
      spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a
      telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).
    </p>
    <h2 id="telekinetic-sphere">Telekinetic Sphere</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Evocation [Force]</li>
      <li><strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 8</li>
      <li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M</li>
      <li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</li>
      <li><strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</li>
      <li><strong>Effect:</strong> 1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around creatures or objects</li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 min./level (D)</li>
      <li><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Reflex negates (object)</li>
      <li><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (object)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This spell functions like <i>resilient sphere,</i> with the addition that the creatures or objects inside the
      globe are nearly weightless. Anything contained within an <i>telekinetic sphere</i> weighs only one-sixteenth of
      its normal weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less.
      The telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the
      sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less by concentrating on the
      sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so (a
      standard action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease concentrating, the sphere
      does not move in that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a
      level surface, or the spell’s duration expires, or you begin concentrating again. If you cease concentrating
      (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), you can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later
      turn during the spell’s duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of
      the sphere.
    </p>
    <p>You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Material Component:</em> A hemispherical piece of clear crystal, a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic,
      and a pair of small bar magnets.
    </p>
    <h2 id="telepathic-bond">Telepathic Bond</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Divination</li>
      <li><strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 5</li>
      <li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M</li>
      <li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</li>
      <li><strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Targets:</strong> You plus one willing creature per three levels, no two of which can be more than 30
        ft. apart
      </li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 min./level (D)</li>
      <li><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None</li>
      <li><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing creatures, each of which must have an
      Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures
      can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is
      established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one
      plane to another).
    </p>
    <p>
      If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. This decision must be made at the time of
      casting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Telepathic bond</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell, though it only bonds two creatures
      per casting of <i>permanency</i>.
    </p>
    <p><em>Material Component:</em> Pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures.</p>
    <h2 id="teleport">Teleport</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Conjuration (Teleportation)</li>
      <li><strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 5, Travel 5</li>
      <li><strong>Components:</strong> V</li>
      <li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</li>
      <li><strong>Range:</strong> Personal and touch</li>
      <li><strong>Target:</strong> You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures</li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster
      level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your
      maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to
      its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium
      creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in
      contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells
      where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance
      applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell
      resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the
      more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more
      hazardous or even impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following
      information for definitions of the terms on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Familiarity:</em> “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home.
      “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you’ve been there often, or
      you have used other means (such as <i>scrying</i>) to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a
      place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that
      you have seen once, possibly using magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      “False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar
      location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When
      traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there
      is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.
    </p>
    <p><em>On Target:</em> You appear where you want to be.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Off Target:</em> You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance
      off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly
    </p>
    <p><em>Similar Area:</em> You wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area.</p>
    <p>
      Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range,
      the spell simply fails instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Mishap:</em> You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of
      damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap”
      comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

      forces cannot be teleported.
    </p>
    <p>
      If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point
      from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted
      <i>dispel magic</i> spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.

    <p>
      This spell functions like <i>teleport,</i> except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive
      off target. In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a
      reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient
      information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear in your original location.
      Interplanar travel is not possible.

    <p>
      You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as <i>greater teleport,</i> any
      creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can’t
      change it. The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place
      with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures from activating it
      accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Teleportation circle</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent
      <i>teleportation circle</i> that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as
      normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> Magic traps such as <i>teleportation circle</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can
      use the Search skill to find the circle and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level,
      or 34 in the case of <i>teleportation circle</i>.
    </p>

      You must succeed on a melee touch attack. You place the subject into a state of suspended animation. For the
      creature, time ceases to flow and its condition becomes fixed. The creature does not grow older. Its body
      functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm it. This state persists until the magic is removed
      (such as by a successful
      <i>dispel magic</i> spell or a <i>freedom</i> spell).

      This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you speed up so greatly that all other
      creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1
      rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can still harm you. While the
      <i>time stop</i> is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target such
      creatures with any attack or spell. A spell that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining
      duration of the <i>time stop</i> have their normal effects on other creatures once the <i>time stop</i> ends. Most
      spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses, summon allies, or flee from combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in normal time, but you can affect any
      item that is not in another creature’s possession.

      You are undetectable while <i>time stop</i> lasts. You cannot enter an area protected by an

      You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you desire around yourself. Half the sphere projects
      above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. As many as nine other Medium creatures can
      fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if you
      remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temperature inside the hut is 70° F if the exterior temperature is between 0° and 100° F. An exterior
      temperature below 0° or above 100° lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis. The hut
      also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of
      less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly upon command or extinguish the light as
      desired. Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons,
      and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from
      outside the hut (they have total concealment).

      This spell enables you to change all metal objects within its area to wood. Weapons, armor, and other metal

    <p>
      This spell turns natural, uncut or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not
      affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or
      otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a –2
      penalty on attack rolls and AC. Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it.
      Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <i>transmute rock to mud</i> is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and
      spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning
      damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since
      <i>transmute rock to mud</i> can’t affect worked stone and doesn’t reach deep enough to undermine such buildings’
      foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or
      even partially toppled by this spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mud remains until a successful <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>transmute mud to rock</i> spell restores its
      substance—but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact
      time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

      You can enter any normal plant (Medium or larger) and pass any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single

      not be familiar to you, but it also must be alive. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of
      destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance and the
      <i>transport via plants</i> spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular
      destination plant is desired but the plant is not living, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry
      plant.

    <p>
      You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one
      additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent
      per three caster levels. Use the following equivalents to determine the maximum number of larger creatures you can
      bring along: A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and
      so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures

    <p>
      <i>Trap the soul</i> forces a creature’s life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped
      entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to
      reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane it can be required to perform a service
      immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.
    </p>
    <p>Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Spell Completion:</em> First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if
      you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid
      the effect. If the creature’s name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by
      2. If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Trigger Object:</em> The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a
      trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature’s soul in the trap. To use
      this method, both the creature’s name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is
      enspelled. A <i>sympathy</i> spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or
      accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell
      resistance or a save.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Material Component:</em> Before the actual casting of <i>trap the soul,</i> you must procure a gem of at least
      1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature to be trapped. If the gem is not valuable enough, it
      shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or Hit Dice as such, the
      value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as
      creatures gain more Hit Dice.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Focus (Trigger Object Only):</em> If the trigger object method is used, a special trigger object, prepared as
      described above, is needed.

      By means of this spell, you are able to assume the form of a Large living tree or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk
      with a small number of limbs. The closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a
      magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a
      <i>detect magic</i> spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that
      transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain
      unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to AC but have an effective Dexterity score of 0 and a speed of 0
      feet. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you.

      You gain the ability to enter trees and move from inside one tree to inside another tree. The first tree you enter
      and all others you enter must be of the same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours. By
      moving into an oak tree (for example), you instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport
      range (see below) and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved
      into. You may choose to pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the

      You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level (passing from one tree to another counts only as moving
      into one tree). The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree. Each transport is a full-round
      action.

    <p>
      You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell

      You confer on the subject the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and
      magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under
      <i>blur</i> or <i>displacement</i> effects, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions,
      and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. Further, the subject can focus its vision to
      see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces). The range of <i>true seeing</i> conferred is
      120 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>True seeing</i>, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its
      equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. <i>True seeing</i> does not
      help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden
      by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use
      <i>true seeing</i> through a <i>crystal ball</i> or in conjunction with <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i>.

    <p><i>Unhallow</i> makes a particular site, building, or structure an unholy site. This has three major effects.</p>
    <p>
      First, the site or structure is guarded by a
      <i>magic circle against good</i> effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, all turning checks made to turn undead take a –4 penalty, and turning checks to rebuke undead gain a +4
      profane bonus. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. (This provision does not apply to the druid version
      of the spell.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the
      <i>unhallowed</i> site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless
      of its normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures,
      creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end
      of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting <i>unhallow</i> again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spell effects that may be tied to an <i>unhallowed</i> site include
      <i
        >aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect magic, detect good,
        dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge,

      and <i>zone of truth</i>.

    <p>
      Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells’ effects. (See the individual spell descriptions
      for details.)

      A malevolent darkness surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells
      cast by good creatures, and weakening good creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four
      effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike the
      effect of
      <i>protection from good</i>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by good creatures.
    </p>
    <p>Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against good spells and spells cast by good creatures.</p>
    <p>
      Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as
      <i>protection from good</i> does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, if a good creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker takes 1d6
      points of temporary Strength damage (Fortitude negates).

      level, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes it to be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save
      reduces damage to half and negates the sickened effect. The effects cannot be negated by <i>remove disease</i> or
      <i>heal,</i> but <i>remove curse</i> is effective.

      The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not sickened. Such a

      An <i>unseen servant</i> is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It
      can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform
      only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you
      remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength
      score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20
      pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can’t perform any
      task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can’t be
      used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates
      if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it
      beyond the spell’s range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.

      current hit points +10, which is enough to kill the subject. The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later.

      You instantly change the appearance of the subjects and then maintain that appearance for the spell’s duration.

      Unwilling targets can negate the spell’s effect on them by making Will saves or with spell resistance. Those who

      An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by
      you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of
      fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn
      each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire
      damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead
      creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the
      wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of cold damage or more in 1 round, that length goes out. (Do
      not divide cold damage by 4, as normal for objects.)

      A <i>wall of force</i> spell creates an invisible wall of force. The wall cannot move, it is immune to damage of
      all kinds, and it is unaffected by most spells, including <i>dispel magic</i>. However,
      <i>disintegrate</i> immediately destroys it, as does a <i>rod of cancellation</i>, a
      <i>sphere of annihilation,</i> or a <i>mage’s disjunction</i> spell. Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through
      the wall in either direction, although <i>dimension door, teleport,</i> and similar effects can bypass the
      barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually get around
      the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks can operate through a
      <i>wall of force</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10- foot square per level. The
      wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell
      fails.

    <p>
      This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A
      <i>wall of ice</i> cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth
      and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to
      disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can
      melt a <i>wall of ice,</i> and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by
      objects). Suddenly melting a <i>wall of ice</i> creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Ice Plane:</em> A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up
      to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10
      feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not
      exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall
      need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A
      section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a
      single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it
      (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no
      save).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Hemisphere:</em> The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster
      level. The <i>hemisphere</i> is as hard to break through as the <i>ice plane</i> form, but it does not deal damage
      to those who go through a breach.

    <p>
      You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving
      material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a
      creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available
      space.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>wall of iron</i> is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall’s area by halving its
      thickness. Each 5- foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of
      wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack,
      the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so
      that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either
      direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A
      creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may
      do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage. The
      wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.
    </p>
    <p>Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.</p>

    <p>
      This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. A <i>wall of stone</i> is 1 inch thick
      per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall’s area by
      halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike a <i>wall of iron,</i> you can create a <i>wall of stone</i> in almost any shape you desire. The wall
      created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly
      supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the
      span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell’s area by
      half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the
      area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a
      <i>disintegrate</i> spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15
      hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a
      creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of
      thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a
      <i>wall of stone</i>, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment
      with successful Reflex saves.

      <li><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A <i>wall of thorns</i> spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns
      as long as a human’s finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a <i>wall of thorns</i> takes
      slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature’s AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do
      not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and
      dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)
    </p>
    <p>
      You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of
      10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns,
      but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every
      5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land
      speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature
      trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is
      caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends.
      Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a <i>wall of thorns</i> at
      normal speed without taking damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>wall of thorns</i> can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe
      passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it
      away in 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite its appearance, a <i>wall of thorns</i> is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells
      that affect plants.

    <p>
      You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door
      springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a
      leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a –4 penalty on attack rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small
      objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as
      thirty-two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell, straightening wood
      that has been warped by this spell or by other means. <i>Make whole</i>, on the other hand, does no good in
      repairing a warped item.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can combine multiple consecutive <i>warp wood</i> spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for
      you to warp with a single spell.

    <p>Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.</p>

      If the spell is cast underwater (or while the subjects are partially or wholly submerged in whatever liquid they

    <p>
      <i>Web</i> creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The
      strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid
      and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a
      <i>web</i> become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won’t cause you to become
      entangled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone in the effect’s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is
      entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see
      below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move from its space, but can break loose by
      spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making
      the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may
      move through the <i>web</i> very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength
      check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds
      10.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of
      web between you, it provides total cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strands of a <i>web</i> spell are flammable. A magic <i>flaming sword</i> can slash them away as easily as a
      hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures
      within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Web</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>web</i> that is damaged (but not
      destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

      This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water
      at a speed of 60 feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone’s every movement or specify a
      simple program. Directing the cyclone’s movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you.
      The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell’s range, it moves in a random,

      Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take
      3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be
      picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round
      on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish,
      depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.

      You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The
      <i>whispering wind</i> travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can
      find a way to the location. A <i>whispering wind</i> is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the
      location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless
      of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.

      You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other

      When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with

      subject, a magical wind wafts a <i>wind walker</i> along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor
      maneuverability. <i>Wind walkers</i> are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed
      in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>wind walker</i> can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and
      from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in
      physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers
      and not others.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the last minute of the spell’s duration, a <i>wind walker</i> in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per
      round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that
      the spell is about to end.

      An invisible vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring
      blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from
      unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Tiny and Small flying
      creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a
      <i>wind wall.</i> Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing
      through the wall has a 30% miss chance. (A giant-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, and other massive
      ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass
      through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).
    </p>
    <p>
      While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is
      possible to create cylindrical or square wind walls to enclose specific points.

    <p>
      <i>Wish</i> is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality
      to better suit you.
    </p>
    <p>Even <i>wish</i>, however, has its limits.</p>
    <p>A <i>wish</i> can produce any one of the following effects.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited
        to you.
      </li>
      <li>Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li>
      <li>Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it’s of a prohibited school.</li>
      <li>Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it’s of a prohibited school.</li>
      <li>
        Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as
        <i>geas/quest</i> or <i>insanity</i>.
      </li>
      <li>Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</li>
      <li>Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.</li>
      <li>
        Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five
        <i>wish</i> spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability
        score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are
        instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. <i>Note:</i> An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single
        ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove injuries and afflictions. A single <i>wish</i> can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects
        are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions
        have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same <i>wish</i>.
        A <i>wish</i> can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss
        from being raised from the dead.
      </li>
      <li>
        Revive the dead. A <i>wish</i> can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a
        <i>resurrection</i> spell. A <i>wish</i> can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task
        takes two <i>wishes,</i> one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A
        <i>wish</i> cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transport travelers. A <i>wish</i> can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place
        those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save
        to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Undo misfortune. A <i>wish</i> can undo a single recent event. The <i>wish</i> forces a reroll of any roll made
        within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For
        example, a <i>wish</i> could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s successful critical hit (either the
        attack roll or the critical roll), a friend’s failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or
        worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance
        (if any) applies.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You may try to use a <i>wish</i> to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The
      <i>wish</i> may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.)
    </p>
    <p>Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).</p>
    <p>
      <em>Material Component:</em> When a <i>wish</i> duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than
      10,000 gp, you must provide that component.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>XP Cost:</em> The minimum XP cost for casting <i>wish</i> is 5,000 XP. When a <i>wish</i> duplicates a spell
      that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a <i>wish</i> creates or improves
      a magic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000
      XP.

      Any nonchaotic creature within the area who hears the

      Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonchaotic extraplanar creatures within the
      area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours.
      This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the <i>word of chaos.</i> The banishment effect
      allows a Will save (at a –4 penalty) to negate.

      <i>Word of recall</i> teleports you instantly back to your sanctuary when the word is uttered. You must designate
      the sanctuary when you prepare the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a
      designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot
      travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, any objects you carry, as long as their weight
      doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying
      gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two
      Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported
      must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. Exceeding
      this limit causes the spell to fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unwilling creature can’t be teleported by
      <i>word of recall.</i> Likewise, a creature’s Will save (or spell resistance) prevents items in its possession
      from being teleported. Unattended, nonmagical objects receive no saving throw.

      By casting <i>zone of silence</i>, you manipulate sound waves in your immediate vicinity so that you and those

      within, including language-dependent or sonic spell effects. This effect is centered on you and moves with you.
      Anyone who enters the zone immediately becomes subject to its effects, but those who leave are no longer affected.
