    </ul>

    <p>
      Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that
      amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like will-o’-wisps), or one faintly glowing,
      vaguely humanoid shape. The <i>dancing lights</i> must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other
      but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning
      corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you
      and it exceeds the spell’s range.
    </p>
    <p><i>Dancing lights</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
    <h2 id="darkness">Darkness</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">

    </ul>

    <p>
      This spell causes an object to radiate shadowy illumination out to a 20-foot radius. All creatures in the area
      gain concealment (20% miss chance). Even creatures that can normally see in such conditions (such as with
      darkvision or low-light vision) have the miss chance in an area shrouded in magical <i>darkness</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) are incapable of brightening the area, as are light
      spells of lower level. Higher level light spells are not affected by <i>darkness.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <i>darkness</i> is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the
      spell’s effect is blocked until the covering is removed.
    </p>
    <p><i>Darkness</i> counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower spell level.</p>

    </ul>

    <p>
      The subject gains the ability to see 60 feet even in total darkness. Darkvision is black and white only but
      otherwise like normal sight.
      <i>Darkvision</i> does not grant one the ability to see in magical darkness.
    </p>
    <p><i>Darkvision</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="darkvision--spell-resistance--material-component">Material Component:</em> Either a pinch of dried carrot

      <li><strong id="daylight--spell-resistance">Spell Resistance:</strong> No</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The object touched sheds light as bright as full daylight in a 60-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 60
      feet beyond that. Creatures that take penalties in bright light also take them while within the radius of this
      magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that
      are damaged or destroyed by bright light.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <i>daylight</i> is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light- proof covering, the
      spell’s effects are blocked until the covering is removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Daylight</i> brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the
      otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.
    </p>
    <p><i>Daylight</i> counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as <i>darkness.</i></p>
    <h2 id="daze">Daze</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]</li>

      <li><strong id="daze--spell-resistance">Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This enchantment clouds the mind of a humanoid creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice so that it takes no actions.
      Humanoids of 5 or more HD are not affected. A dazed subject is not stunned, so attackers get no special advantage
      against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="daze--spell-resistance--material-component">Material Component:</em> A pinch of wool or similar substance.

      <li><strong id="daze-monster--target">Target:</strong> One living creature of 6 HD or less</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This spell functions like <i>daze,</i> but <i>daze monster</i> can affect any one living creature of any type.
      Creatures of 7 or more HD are not affected.
    </p>
    <h2 id="death-knell">Death Knell</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">

      <li><strong id="death-knell--spell-resistance">Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You draw forth the ebbing life force of a creature and use it to fuel your own power. Upon casting this spell, you
      touch a living creature that has –1 or fewer hit points. If the subject fails its saving throw, it dies, and you
      gain 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 bonus to Strength. Additionally, your effective caster level goes up by +1,
      improving spell effects dependent on caster level. (This increase in effective caster level does not grant you
      access to more spells.) These effects last for 10 minutes per HD of the subject creature.
    </p>
    <h2 id="death-ward">Death Ward</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Necromancy</li>

      <li><strong id="death-ward--spell-resistance">Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (harmless)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The subject is immune to all death spells, magical death effects, energy drain, and any negative energy effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      This spell doesn’t remove negative levels that the subject has already gained, nor does it affect the saving throw
      necessary 24 hours after gaining a negative level.
    </p>
    <p><i>Death ward</i> does not protect against other sorts of attacks even if those attacks might be lethal.</p>
    <h2 id="deathwatch">Deathwatch</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">

      <li><strong id="deathwatch--spell-resistance">Spell Resistance:</strong> No</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Using the foul sight granted by the powers of unlife, you can determine the condition of creatures near death
      within the spell’s range. You instantly know whether each creature within the area is dead, fragile (alive and
      wounded, with 3 or fewer hit points left), fighting off death (alive with 4 or more hit points), undead, or
      neither alive nor dead (such as a construct).
    </p>
    <p><i>Deathwatch</i> sees through any spell or ability that allows creatures to feign death.</p>

      <li><strong id="deep-slumber--range">Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This spell functions like <i>sleep,</i> except that it affects 10 HD of creatures.</p>
    <h2 id="deeper-darkness">Deeper Darkness</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Evocation [Darkness]</li>

      <li><strong id="deeper-darkness--duration">Duration:</strong> One day/level (D)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This spell functions like <i>darkness</i>, except that the object radiates shadowy illumination in a 60-foot
      radius and the <i>darkness</i> lasts longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Daylight</i> brought into an area of <i>deeper darkness</i> (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the
      otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Deeper darkness</i> counters and dispels any light spell of equal or lower level, including <i>daylight</i> and
      <i>light.</i>
    </p>
    <h2 id="delay-poison">Delay Poison</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">

      <li><strong id="delay-poison--spell-resistance">Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (harmless)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The subject becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any poison to which it is exposed
      during the spell’s duration does not affect the subject until the spell’s duration has expired.
      <i>Delay poison</i> does not cure any damage that poison may have already done.
    </p>
    <h2 id="delayed-blast-fireball">Delayed Blast Fireball</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Evocation [Fire]</li>

      <li><strong id="delayed-blast-fireball--duration">Duration:</strong> 5 rounds or less; see text</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This spell functions like <i>fireball,</i> except that it is more powerful and can detonate up to 5 rounds after
      the spell is cast. The burst of flame deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6).
    </p>
    <p>
      The glowing bead created by <i>delayed blast fireball</i> can detonate immediately if you desire, or you can
      choose to delay the burst for as many as 5 rounds. You select the amount of delay upon completing the spell, and
      that time cannot change once it has been set unless someone touches the bead (see below). If you choose a delay,
      the glowing bead sits at its destination until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a thrown
      weapon (range increment 10 feet). If a creature handles and moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, there
      is a 25% chance that the bead detonates while being handled.

      <li><strong id="demand--spell-resistance">Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This spell functions like <i>sending,</i> but the message can also contain a <i>suggestion</i> (see the
      <i>suggestion</i> spell), which the subject does its best to carry out. A successful Will save negates the
      <i>suggestion</i> effect but not the contact itself. The <i>demand,</i> if received, is understood even if the
      subject’s Intelligence score is as low as 1. If the message is impossible or meaningless according to the
      circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the <i>demand</i> is issued, the message is understood but
      the <i>suggestion</i> is ineffective.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>demand</i>’s message to the creature must be twenty-five words or less, including the
      <i>suggestion.</i> The creature can also give a short reply immediately.

      <li><strong id="desecrate--spell-resistance">Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This spell imbues an area with negative energy. Each Charisma check made to turn undead within this area takes a
      –3 profane penalty, and every undead creature entering a <i>desecrated</i> area gains a +1 profane bonus on attack
      rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. An undead creature created within or summoned into such an area gains +1
      hit points per HD.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the <i>desecrated</i> area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity or
      aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (–6 profane penalty on turning checks, +2 profane
      bonus and +2 hit points per HD for undead in the area).
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, anyone who casts <i>animate dead</i> within this area may create as many as double the normal amount
      of undead (that is, 4 HD per caster level rather than 2 HD per caster level).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture of a deity, pantheon, or higher power other than
      your patron, the
      <i>desecrate</i> spell instead curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power.
      This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given
      above.

      This spell instantly slays the subject and consumes its remains (but not its equipment and possessions) utterly.
      If the target’s Fortitude saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 10d6 points of damage. The only way to restore
      life to a character who has failed to save against this spell is to use <i>true resurrection</i>, a carefully

    <p>
      You can detect a particular kind of animal or plant in a cone emanating out from you in whatever direction you
      face. You must think of a kind of animal or plant when using the spell, but you can change the animal or plant
      kind each round. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you search a particular area or focus on a

      The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps.

      <i>Detect snares and pits</i> does detect certain natural hazards—quicksand (a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or
      unsafe walls of natural rock (a deadfall). However, it does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions. The
      spell does not detect magic traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the spell
      <i>snare</i>), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.

      objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium
      creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in

      A <i>discern location</i> spell is among the most powerful means of locating creatures or objects. Nothing short

      single individual or object. <i>Discern location</i> circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or
      location. The spell reveals the name of the creature or object’s location (place, name, business name, building
      name, or the like), community, county (or similar political division), country, continent, and the plane of
      existence where the target lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find a creature with the spell, you must have seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To
      find an object, you must have touched it at least once.

      You make yourself—including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment—look different. You can seem 1 foot shorter or

      A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any
      creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any creature
      reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine
      dust. A disintegrated creature’s equipment is unaffected.
    </p>
    <p>
      When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as one 10- foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus,
      the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects
      constructed entirely of force, such as <i>forceful hand</i> or a <i>wall of force</i>, but not magical effects
      such as a <i>globe of invulnerability</i> or an <i>antimagic field.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of
      damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.

      This spell forces an extraplanar creature back to its proper plane if it fails a special Will save (DC = spell’s

    <p>
      You can use <i>dispel magic</i> to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily
      suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area,
      or to counter another spellcaster’s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as
      detailed in their descriptions, can’t be defeated by <i>dispel magic</i>. <i>Dispel magic</i> can dispel (but not
      counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="dispel-magic--spell-resistance--note">Note:</em> The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration
      can’t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic</i> can take effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      You choose to use <i>dispel magic</i> in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="dispel-magic--spell-resistance--targeted-dispel">Targeted Dispel:</em> One object, creature, or spell is
      the target of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10)
      against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this
      dispel check is 11 + the spell’s caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if
      you fail, that spell remains in effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by
      <i>monster summoning</i>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item’s caster level. If you
      succeed, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its
      own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a
      <i>bag of holding</i>) is temporarily closed. A magic item’s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic
      sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as
      this.
    </p>
    <p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="dispel-magic--spell-resistance--area-dispel">Area Dispel:</em> When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this
      way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the
      spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker
      spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the
      <i>dispel magic</i> spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature’s
      magic items are not affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with
      creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell,
      you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the
      <i>dispel magic</i> spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by
      <i>monster summoning</i>) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object
      or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or
      object.
    </p>
    <p>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="dispel-magic--spell-resistance--counterspell">Counterspell:</em> When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this
      way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however,
      <i>dispel magic</i> may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster’s spell.

      The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50%
      miss chance as if it had total concealment. However, unlike actual total concealment,
      <i>displacement</i> does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. <i>True seeing</i> reveals its
      true location.

      advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party

      chance for a correct <i>divination</i> is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. If the dice roll fails,

      <i>dominated</i> animal) are simply ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dominate animal</i> establishes a mental link between you and the subject creature. The animal can be directed
      by silent mental command as long as it remains in range. You need not see the creature to control it. You do not
      receive direct sensory input from the creature, but you know what it is experiencing. Because you are directing
      the animal with your own intelligence, it may be able to undertake actions normally beyond its own comprehension.
      You need not concentrate exclusively on controlling the creature unless you are trying to direct it to do
      something it normally couldn’t do. Changing your instructions or giving a <i>dominated</i> creature a new command
      is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.

    <p>
      You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the
      subject’s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire,
      within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as
      “Come here,” “Go there,” “Fight,” and “Stand still.” You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not
      receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have given a <i>dominated</i> creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to
      the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating,
      and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25)
      can determine that the subject’s behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill
      description).
    </p>
    <p>
      Changing your instructions or giving a <i>dominated</i> creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a
      spell, so it is a move action.
    </p>
    <p>
      By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the
      mind of the subject, though it still can’t communicate with you. You can’t actually see through the subject’s
      eyes, so it’s not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what’s going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving
      throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the
      range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need
      not see the subject to control it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don’t spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw
      to throw off the domination.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Protection from evil</i> or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic
      link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor
      dispels it.

    </ul>

    <p>
      You, or a messenger touched by you, sends a phantasmal message to others in the form of a dream. At the beginning
      of the spell, you must name the recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to
      identity. The messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient’s dream, and delivers the message.
      The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is
      one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by
      observing the dreams of the recipient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the message is delivered, the messenger’s mind returns instantly to its body. The duration of the spell is
      the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient’s dream and deliver the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain
      in the trance. The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the
      recipient’s dream and deliver the message as normal. A messenger that is disturbed during the trance comes awake,
      ending the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures who don’t sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves) or don’t dream cannot be contacted by this spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities around it while in the trance. It is
      defenseless both physically and mentally (always fails any saving throw) while in the trance.

      The transmuted creature becomes more poised, articulate, and personally forceful. The spell grants a +4
      enhancement bonus to Charisma, adding the usual benefits to Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the
      Charisma modifier. Sorcerers and bards (and other spellcasters who rely on Charisma) affected by this spell do not
      gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Charisma, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under

      When you cast <i>earthquake,</i> an intense but highly localized tremor rips the ground. The shock knocks
      creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during
      which time creatures on the ground can’t move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration
      check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain,
      vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an <i>earthquake</i> spell depends on
      the nature of the terrain where it is cast.

      <em id="earthquake--spell-resistance--cave-cavern-or-tunnel">Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel:</em> The spell collapses the
      roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and
      pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An <i>earthquake</i> cast on the roof of a very large cavern
      could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.

    <p>
      <i>Cliffs: Earthquake</i> causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it

      fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any
      creatures still trapped within.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="earthquake--spell-resistance--structure">Structure:</em> Any structure standing on open ground takes 100

      reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is.
      Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and

      Earth, Fire, or Water); a cleric opens a portal to the plane matching his domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the spell is complete, 2d4 Large elementals appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 Huge elementals appear. Ten
      minutes after that, one greater elemental appears. Each elemental has maximum hit points per HD. Once these
      creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them.
      You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can dismiss them singly or in groups
      at any time.

      You point your finger and utter the incantation, releasing a black ray of crackling negative energy that
      suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If the
      attack succeeds, the subject gains 1d4 negative levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the subject has at least as many negative levels as HD, it dies. Each negative level gives a creature a –1
      penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the
      power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities).
    </p>

      Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his or her highest available level. Negative levels

      Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum

    <p>
      This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This
      increase changes the creature’s size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to
      Strength, a –2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a –1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its
      increased size.
    </p>
    <p>
      A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This
      spell does not change the target’s speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may
      make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is
      constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it— the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing
      its size.
    </p>
    <p>
      All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons
      affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any
      <i>enlarged</i> item that leaves an <i>enlarged</i> creature’s possession (including a projectile or thrown
      weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and
      projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of
      <i>enlarged</i> items are not increased by this spell.

      creature that succeeds on a Reflex save is not entangled but can still move at only half speed through the area.
      Each round on your turn, the plants once again attempt to entangle all creatures that have avoided or escaped
      entanglement.

    <p>
      If you have the attention of a group of creatures, you can use this spell to hold them spellbound. To cast the
      spell, you must speak or sing without interruption for 1 full round. Thereafter, those affected give you their
      undivided attention, ignoring their surroundings. They are considered to have an attitude of friendly while under
      the effect of the spell. Any potentially affected creature of a race or religion unfriendly to yours gets a +4
      bonus on the saving throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher remains aware of its surroundings and has an
      attitude of indifferent. It gains a new saving throw if it witnesses actions that it opposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1 hour. Those <i>enthralled</i> by your words take
      no action while you speak or sing and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those
      entering the area during the performance must also successfully save or become <i>enthralled.</i> The speech ends
      (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose concentration or do anything other than speak or sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If those not <i>enthralled</i> have unfriendly or hostile attitudes toward you, they can collectively make a
      Charisma check to try to end the spell by jeering and heckling. For this check, use the Charisma bonus of the
      creature with the highest Charisma in the group; others may make Charisma checks to assist. The heckling ends the
      spell if this check result beats your Charisma check result. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the
      spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any member of the audience is attacked or subjected to some other overtly hostile act, the spell ends and the
      previously
      <i>enthralled</i> members become immediately unfriendly toward you. Each creature with 4 or more HD or with a
      Wisdom score of 16 or higher becomes hostile.

      A magical field appears around you, glowing with a chaotic blast of multicolored hues. This field deflects
      incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks. Each ranged attack directed at you for which the attacker must

    </ul>

    <p>
      <i>Erase</i> removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper,
      parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove <i>explosive runes,</i> a
      <i>glyph of warding,</i> a <i>sepia snake sigil,</i> or an <i>arcane mark</i>, but not <i>illusory script</i> or a
      <i>symbol</i> spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it.
      Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster
      level) against DC 15. (A natural 1 or 2 is always a failure on this check.) If you fail to erase
      <i>explosive runes</i>, a <i>glyph of warding</i>, or a <i>sepia snake sigil</i>, you accidentally activate that
      writing instead.

    <p>
      You become ethereal, along with your equipment. For the duration of the spell, you are in a place called the
      Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the normal, physical, Material Plane. When the spell expires, you return to
      material existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ethereal creature is invisible, insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit
      at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living
      creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral.
      Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane
      from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can’t attack material creatures, and spells you
      cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or
      effects that work on the Ethereal Plane.
    </p>
    <p>Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material.</p>
    <p>
      If you end the spell and become material while inside a material object (such as a solid wall), you are shunted
      off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet that you so travel.

    <p>
      This spell functions like <i>ethereal jaunt,</i> except that you and other willing creatures joined by linked
      hands (along with their equipment) become ethereal. Besides yourself, you can bring one creature per three caster
      levels to the Ethereal Plane. Once ethereal, the subjects need not stay together.
    </p>
    <p>When the spell expires, all affected creatures on the Ethereal Plane return to material existence.</p>

      This spell increases your base land speed by 30 feet. (This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.) There
      is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases
      your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the Jump skill).

    <p>
      You trace these mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The
      <i>runes</i> detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the <i>runes</i> (close enough
      to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the <i>runes</i> is
      entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object on which the <i>runes</i> were written also takes full
      damage (no saving throw).
    </p>
    <p>
      You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the
      <i>runes.</i> Likewise, you can remove the <i>runes</i> whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a
      successful <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>erase</i> spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the <i>runes</i> and
      failing to do so triggers the explosion.

    <p>
      <em id="explosive-runes--spell-resistance--note">Note:</em> Magic traps such as <i>explosive runes</i> are hard to

      A sickened creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and
      ability checks. A creature affected by this spell remains sickened for 10 minutes per caster level. The effects
      cannot be negated by a <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i> spell, but a <i>remove curse</i> is effective.

      after the panic ends, the creature remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes
      panicked again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="eyebite--spell-resistance--comatose">Comatose:</em> The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes
      per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not
      a <i>sleep</i> effect, and thus elves are not immune to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell lasts for 1 round per three caster levels. You must spend a move action each round after the first to
      target a foe.
