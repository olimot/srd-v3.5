    <p>
      You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The
      passage is 10 feet deep plus an additional 5 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (15 feet at 12th, 20 feet
      at 15th, and a maximum of 25 feet deep at 18th level). If the wall’s thickness is more than the depth of the
      passage created, then a single <i>passwall</i> simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several
      <i>passwall</i> spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When <i>passwall</i> ends,
      creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the <i>passwall</i> or you
      dismiss it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if there is one, or out the sole exit if there
      is only one.

    <p>
      You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears
      of the subject’s subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast.
      Only the spell’s subject can see the phantasmal killer. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will
      save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must
      succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6
      points of damage.
    </p>
    <p>

      You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature. The steed can be ridden only by you or by the one person for
      whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and
      smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does
      not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mount has an AC of 18 (–1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. If
      it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per caster
      level, to a maximum of 240 feet. It can bear its rider’s weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.
    </p>
    <p>
      These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount’s abilities include those of mounts of lower
      caster levels.

    <p>
      <em>8th Level:</em> The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in
      speed.

    <p>
      <em>12th Level:</em> The mount can use <i>air walk</i> at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this

      This spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem to be trapped to anyone who can detect traps. You place the
      spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able
      to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is 100% certain a real trap exists. Of
      course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is “sprung”; its primary purpose is to frighten
      away thieves or make them waste precious time.

    <p>
      This spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The
      <i>phase door</i> is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. You
      disappear when you enter the <i>phase door</i> and appear when you exit. If you desire, you can take one other
      creature (Medium or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light,
      sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an
      escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. A
      <i>gem of true seeing</i> or similar magic reveals the presence of a <i>phase door</i> but does not allow its use.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>phase door</i> is subject to <i>dispel magic.</i> If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is
      harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a <i>passwall</i> effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can allow other creatures to use the <i>phase door</i> by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such
      conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or
      alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit
      Dice, and hit points don’t qualify.
    </p>
    <p><i>Phase door</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>

    </ul>

    <p>
      By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an elemental or outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the
      deity’s choice. If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your
      philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature’s name, you may request that individual by speaking
      the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).
    </p>
    <p>
      You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple
      to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating
      gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your
      part that matches the creature’s alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature
      agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the
      round after it arrives.
    </p>
    <p>
      A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a
      task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one
      requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a
      greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually
      dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature’s
      ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after
      reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water
      creature, it is a spell of that type.

    <p>
      Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared
      trap, which must lie within the spell’s range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform
      one service in return for its freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create the trap, you must use a <i>magic circle</i> spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound
      must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual’s proper name in
      casting the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell.
      If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from
      being called). The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against
      your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level
      + your Cha modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A
      <i>dimensional anchor</i> cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a
      calling diagram (see <i>magic circle against evil</i>) to make the trap more secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to
      compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You
      make a Charisma check opposed by the creature’s Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on
      the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers,
      bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the
      creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other
      spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the
      creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it
      came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete
      though its own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature
      gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a
      spell of that type.

      This spell functions like <i>alter self,</i> except that you change the willing subject into another form of
      living creature. The new form may be of the same type as the subject or any of the following types: aberration,
      animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin. The assumed form
      can’t have more Hit Dice than your caster level (or the subject’s HD, whichever is lower), to a maximum of 15 HD
      at 15th level. You can’t cause a subject to assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you cause a subject to assume
      an incorporeal or gaseous form. The subject’s creature type and subtype (if any) change to match the new form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon changing, the subject regains lost hit points as if it had rested for a night (though this healing does not
      restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal the
      subject further). If slain, the subject reverts to its original form, though it remains dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject gains the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retains its own
      Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also gains all extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form
      but does not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form or any supernatural or spell-like
      abilities.

      This spell functions like <i>polymorph,</i> except that it changes one object or creature into another. The
      duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state. The
      duration is determined by using the following guidelines.

      Unlike <i>polymorph, polymorph any object</i> does grant the creature the Intelligence score of its new form. If
      the original form didn’t have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In general, damage
      occurs when the new form is changed through physical force.

      A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell. Magic items aren’t affected by this spell.

      This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum,

      This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of
      <i>baleful polymorph, polymorph, flesh to stone</i>, <i>stone to flesh</i>, <i>transmute mud to rock</i>,

    <p>
      Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a
      <i>prestidigitation</i> spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and
      have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil
      items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal
      damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. <i>Prestidigitation</i> can create small objects, but they
      look crude and artificial. The materials created by a <i>prestidigitation</i> spell are extremely fragile, and
      they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a <i>prestidigitation</i> lacks the power to
      duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it)
      persists only 1 hour.

    <p>
      This spell functions like <i>prismatic wall,</i> except you conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering,
      multicolored light that surrounds you and protects you from all forms of attack. The sphere flashes in all colors
      of the visible spectrum.
    </p>
    <p>The sphere’s <i>blindness</i> effect on creatures with less than 8 HD lasts 2d4x10 minutes.</p>
    <p>
      You can pass into and out of the <i>prismatic sphere</i> and remain near it without harm. However, when you’re
      inside it, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere (including spells). Other
      creatures that attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe will exist, since you are at the center of the sphere, so the
      lower half is usually excluded by the floor surface you are standing on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a

      <i>Prismatic wall</i> creates a vertical, opaque wall—a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you
      from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The
      wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. However, any other creature with
      less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded for 2d4 rounds by the colors if it looks at the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wall’s maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level. A
      <i>prismatic wall</i> spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is
      wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order
      in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic
      needed to negate each color.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first
      color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A
      <i>rod of cancellation</i> or a<i>mage’s disjunction</i> spell destroys a <i>prismatic wall</i>, but an
      <i>antimagic field</i> fails to penetrate it. <i>Dispel magic</i> and <i>greater dispel magic</i> cannot dispel
      the wall or anything beyond it. Spell resistance is effective against a <i>prismatic wall</i>, but the caster
      level check must be repeated for each color present.
    </p>
    <p><i>Prismatic wall</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>

      flames than a new set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an
      attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves.

      You set the triggering condition (which may be a special word) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the

      You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real, illusory version of yourself. The projected image
      looks, sounds, and smells like you but is intangible. The projected image mimics your actions (including speech)
      unless you direct it to act differently (which is a move action).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn
      you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action. While you are using its
      senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened.

    <p>
      If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the projected image instead
      of from you. The projected image can’t cast any spells on itself except for illusion spells. The spells affect
      other targets normally, despite originating from the projected image.

      You must maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the

      <i>dimension door, teleport, plane shift,</i> or a similar spell that breaks your line of effect, even

    <p>
      This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It
      creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has
      three major effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply
      against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a <i>magic jar</i> attack, for example)
      or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment
      (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as <i>dominate person</i>). The
      protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for
      the duration of the <i>protection from evil</i> effect. If the <i>protection from evil</i> effect ends before the
      effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled
      creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before
      the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such
      creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned
      creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded
      creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can
      allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Arcane Material Component:</em> A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot -diameter circle on the
      floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.

    <p>
      You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called “eyes”) equal to 1d4 + your caster level. These
      eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet
      (normal vision only) in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they’re small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct,
      about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet
      with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 Hide modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level
      (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to
      receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than
      twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen
      during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an
      eye disappears.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye
      is such that you won’t know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other
      event.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. <i>Dispel magic</i> can destroy
      eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could
      hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.

      This spell functions like <i>prying eyes,</i> except that the eyes can see all things as they actually are, just
      as if they had <i>true seeing</i> with a range of 120 feet. Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at full normal
      speed. Also, a <i>greater prying eye</i>’s maximum Spot modifier is +25 instead of +15.

      <li><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes or No; see text</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <i>Pyrotechnics</i> turns a fire into either a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick cloud of choking smoke,
      depending on the version you choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Fireworks:</em> The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights. This
      effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates).
      These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. Spell resistance can prevent blindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Smoke Cloud:</em> A writhing stream of smoke billows out from the source, forming a choking cloud. The cloud
      spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even darkvision, is
      ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take –4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity (Fortitude
      negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of
      the cloud. Spell resistance does not apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Material Component:</em> The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire so large
      that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a
      fire-based creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level.

    </ul>

    <p>
      <i>Quench</i> is often used to put out forest fires and other conflagrations. It extinguishes all nonmagical fires
      in its area. The spell also dispels any fire spells in its area, though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20
      +1 per caster level, maximum +15) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster
      level of the fire spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each elemental (fire) creature within the area of a <i>quench</i> spell takes 1d6 points of damage per caster
      level (maximum 15d6, no save allowed).
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can target the spell on a single magic item that creates or controls flame. The item loses all
      its fire-based magical abilities for 1d4 hours unless it succeeds on a Will save. (Artifacts are immune to this
      effect.)

      A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors fascinates those within it.
      <i>Rainbow pattern</i> fascinates a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected
      first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell’s point of origin are affected first. An
      affected creature that fails its saves is fascinated by the pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the rainbow pattern move up to 30 feet per round (moving its

      within the effect. Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it. If

      Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 Hit Die) when it is raised,
      just as if it had lost a level or a Hit Die to an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it loses
      2 points of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This level/HD
      loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50%
      chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A
      spellcasting creature that doesn’t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused
      spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level.
    </p>
    <p>
      A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current Hit Dice. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are
      raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical
      diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds,
      the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature
      is brought back to life. None of the dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this
      spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be raised by this spell.
      Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature
      that has died of old age.

      By means of <i>read magic,</i> you can decipher magical inscriptions on objects—books, scrolls, weapons, and the
      like—that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the
      writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have
      read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use
      of <i>read magic.</i> You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to
      identify a <i>glyph of warding</i> with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a <i>greater glyph of warding</i> with a DC 16
      Spellcraft check, or any <i>symbol</i> spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

    <p>
      This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, length, and width and dividing
      its weight by 8. This decrease changes the creature’s size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2
      size bonus to Dexterity, a –2 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and AC
      due to its reduced size.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet
      (meaning that it must enter an opponent’s square to attack). A Large humanoid creature whose size decreases to
      Medium has a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet. This spell doesn’t change the target’s speed.
    </p>
    <p>All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell.</p>
    <p>
      Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any
      <i>reduced</i> item that leaves the <i>reduced</i> creature’s possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon)
      instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal

    <p>
      You create powerful magic in some specially prepared object. This object contains the power to instantly transport
      its possessor across any distance within the same plane to your abode. Once the item is transmuted, you must give
      it willingly to a creature and at the same time inform it of a command word to be spoken when the item is used. To
      make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a
      standard action). When this is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and carrying (to a maximum of
      the character’s heavy load) are instantly transported to your abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a
      familiar that is touching the subject).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can alter the spell when casting it so that it transports you to within 10 feet of the possessor of the item
      when it is broken and the command word spoken. You will have a general idea of the location and situation of the
      item possessor at the time the <i>refuge</i> spell is discharged, but once you decide to alter the spell in this
      fashion, you have no choice whether or not to be transported.

      complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise.

    <p>
      With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one
      week before the casting of the spell and the subject’s soul is free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul
      is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving
      throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition
      of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature’s body still exists, it can be
      reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature’s body at the time of death.
      The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements
      at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats,
      or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are
      unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the
      subject’s racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found
      below to its remaining ability scores. The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1st
      level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. (If this reduction would put its Con at 0 or lower, it can’t be
      reincarnated). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s possible for the change in the subject’s ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous
      character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table. For nonhumanoid creatures, a
      similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by
      this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring
      back a creature who has died of old age.

      acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject gains energy resistance 10 against the energy type chosen,
      meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that
      damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature’s hit points. The value of the energy
      resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell
      protects the recipient’s equipment as well.

    <p>
      The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature’s body still exists,

      of death. (The remains of a creature hit by a

      Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no

      Your height immediately doubles, and your weight increases by a factor of eight. This increase changes your size

      gain a +4 enhancement bonus to your natural armor. You gain damage reduction 5/evil (if you normally channel
      positive energy) or damage reduction 5/good (if you normally channel negative energy). At 12th level this damage
      reduction becomes 10/evil or 10/good, and at 15th level it becomes 15/evil or 15/good (the maximum). Your size

      If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and may make a
      Strength check (using your increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If you fail, you are
      constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you— the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size.

      All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons deal more damage.
      Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession (including
      a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their
      normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them).

      When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until

      fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional spaces (“planes”).
      Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless
      those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size). Creatures in the space
      can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope “disappear.” In that case, the rope counts as one of the
      eight creatures that can fit in the space. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that
      can pull the rope free.

      Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the
      extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by- 5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is
      present on the Material Plane, but it’s invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can’t see through
      it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one
      person at a time. The <i>rope trick</i> spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all
      the way to the extradimensional space.

      <em>Note:</em> It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to
      take an extradimensional space into an existing one.

      Any iron or iron alloy item you touch becomes instantaneously rusted, pitted, and worthless, effectively
      destroyed. If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius a 3-foot-radius volume of the metal
      is rusted and destroyed. Magic items made of metal are immune to this spell.

      You may employ <i>rusting grasp</i> in combat with a successful melee touch attack. <i>Rusting grasp</i> used in
      this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of Armor Class gained from metal armor (to the maximum amount of
      protection the armor offered) through corrosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch
      attack against the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> Striking at an opponent’s weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon
      and not the other way around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against a ferrous creature, <i>rusting grasp</i> instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage +1 per caster level
      (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch
      attack per round.
