    <p>
      A magical arrow of acid springs from your hand and speeds to its target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack
      to hit your target. The arrow deals 2d4 points of acid damage with no splash damage. For every three caster levels
      (to a maximum of 18th), the acid, unless somehow neutralized, lasts for another round, dealing another 2d4 points
      of damage in that round.

    <p>
      <i>Acid fog</i> creates a billowing mass of misty vapors similar to that produced by a <i>solid fog</i> spell. In
      addition to slowing creatures down and obscuring sight, this spell’s vapors are highly acidic. Each round on your
      turn, starting when you cast the spell, the fog deals 2d6 points of acid damage to each creature and object within
      it.

    <p>
      <i>Aid</i> grants the target a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saves against fear effects, plus temporary hit
      points equal to 1d8 + caster level (to a maximum of 1d8+10 temporary hit points at caster level 10th).

    <h2 id="air-walk">Air Walk</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Transmutation [Air]</li>
      <li><strong>Level:</strong> Air 4, Clr 4, Drd 4</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      The subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The
      maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the air walker’s normal
      speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong wind (21+ mph) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of its turn each round, the wind
      blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional
      penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage
      from being buffeted about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats
      downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If
      not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell
      effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the <i>air walk</i> spell is dispelled, but not if
      it is negated by an <i>antimagic field</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can cast <i>air walk</i> on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You can train a
      mount to move with the aid of <i>air walk</i> (counts as a trick; see Handle Animal skill) with one week of work
      and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.

    <h2 id="alarm">Alarm</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Abjuration</li>
      <li><strong>Level:</strong> Brd 1, Rgr 1, Sor/Wiz 1</li>
      <li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, F/DF</li>
      <li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</li>

      <li><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <i>Alarm</i> sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area
      or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the
      <i>alarm</i>. You decide at the time of casting whether the <i>alarm</i> will be mental or audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Mental Alarm:</em> A mental <i>alarm</i> alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the
      warded area. You note a single mental “ping” that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb
      concentration. A <i>silence</i> spell has no effect on a mental <i>alarm</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Audible Alarm:</em> An audible <i>alarm</i> produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of
      the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20
      feet for each substantial interposing wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round.
      Creatures within a <i>silence</i> spell cannot hear the ringing.
    </p>
    <p>Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the <i>alarm</i>.</p>
    <p><i>Alarm</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
    <p><em>Arcane Focus:</em> A tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver wire</p>

    <p>
      <i>Align weapon</i> makes a weapon good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as you choose. A weapon that is aligned can
      bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures. This spell has no effect on a weapon that already has an
      alignment.
    </p>
    <p>You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike.</p>
    <p>
      When you make a weapon good, evil, lawful, or chaotic,
      <i>align weapon</i> is a good, evil, lawful, or chaotic spell, respectively.

    <h2 id="alter-self">Alter Self</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">

      <li><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</li>

      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 min./level (D)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form. The new form must be within one size
      category of your normal size. The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a maximum of 5
      HD at 5th level. You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      You retain your own ability scores. Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save
      bonuses all remain the same. You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your
      normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath
      weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).
    </p>
    <p>
      You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels, but you lose any from your
      normal form that are not derived from class levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any spellcasting ability you had in
      your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal
      components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include
      natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with
      wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural
      weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical
      qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not
      allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities,
      such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form. Your
      creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form. You cannot take the form of any
      creature with a template, even if that template doesn’t change the creature type or subtype.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can freely designate the new form’s minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin
      color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form’s significant physical qualities (such
      as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form’s
      kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form’s race. If you use this spell to create a
      disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of
      wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your true
      form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously
      occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can’t wear in your normal
      form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both
      forms at the time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is
      separated from the whole reverts to its true form.

    <p>
      You discern all spells and magical properties present in a number of creatures or objects. Each round, you may
      examine a single creature or object that you can see as a free action. In the case of a magic item, you learn its
      functions, how to activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if it uses charges). In
      the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its
      caster level.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. If the save succeeds,
      you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save
      cannot be affected by any other <i>analyze dweomer</i> spells for 24 hours.

    <p>
      A number of animals grow to twice their normal size and eight times their normal weight. This alteration changes
      each animal’s size category to the next largest, grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to
      Constitution (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a –2 size penalty to Dexterity. The creature’s
      existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal’s modifier to AC and attack
      rolls and its base damage. The animal’s space and reach change as appropriate to the new size, but its speed does
      not change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. If
      insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make
      a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is
      constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it— the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing
      its size.
    </p>
    <p>
      All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on
      the magical properties of any such equipment.
    </p>
    <p>Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature’s possession instantly returns to its normal size.</p>
    <p>The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.</p>
    <p>Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.</p>

    <p>
      You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to
      carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such
      creatures as familiars and animal companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you. It advances and awaits your
      bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The
      directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can’t find a destination on its own.
      You can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits
      there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.
    </p>

      During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it

    <p>
      This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow your spoken
      commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The undead can follow you, or they can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of
      creature) entering the place. They remain animated until they are destroyed. (A destroyed skeleton or zombie can’t
      be animated again.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can’t create more HD of undead than twice your
      caster level with a single casting of <i>animate dead</i>. (The <i>desecrate</i> spell doubles this limit)
    </p>
    <p>
      The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell,
      however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the
      newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled.
      (You choose which creatures are released.) If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your
      power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Skeletons:</em> A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have
      bones. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Zombies:</em> A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature
      with a true anatomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Material Component:</em> You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per Hit Die of the undead into
      the mouth or eye socket of each corpse you intend to animate. The magic of the spell turns these gems into
      worthless, burned-out shells.

    </p>
    <p>
      An animated object can be of any nonmagical material. You may animate one Small or smaller object or an equivalent
      number of larger objects per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object
      as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two. You can
      change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell.

    <p>
      You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life. Each animated plant then immediately attacks
      whomever or whatever you initially designate as though it were an animated object of the appropriate size
      category. You may animate one Large or smaller plant, or an equivalent number of larger plants, per three caster
      levels. A Huge plant counts as two Large or smaller plants, a Gargantuan plant as four, and a Colossal plant as
      eight. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell.
    </p>
    <p>Use the statistics for animated objects, except that plants smaller than Large usually don’t have hardness.</p>
    <p><i>Animate plants</i> cannot affect plant creatures, nor does it affect nonliving vegetable material.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Entangle:</em> Alternatively, you may imbue all plants within range with a degree of mobility, which allows
      them to entwine around creatures in the area. This usage of the spell duplicates the effect of an
      <i>entangle</i> spell. Spell resistance does not keep creatures from being entangled. This effect lasts 1 hour per

      <li><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None</li>
      <li><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can animate a nonliving ropelike object. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter.</p>
    <p>
      Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction
      of the rope’s diameter by half.
    </p>
    <p>
      The possible commands are “coil” (form a neat, coiled stack), “coil and knot,” “loop,” “loop and knot,” “tie and
      knot,” and the opposites of all of the above (“uncoil,” and so forth). You can give one command each round as a
      move action, as if directing an active spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it—it does not snake outward—so it must be
      thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10
      feet). A typical 1- inch-diameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to
      burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that
      fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell
      must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape
      Artist check.
    </p>
    <p>The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.</p>
    <p>This spell grants a +2 bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using the transmuted rope.</p>
    <p>The spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.</p>

      This spell may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that

    <p>
      An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical
      effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning
      of any magic items or spells within its confines.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <i>antimagic field</i> suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area,
      but does not dispel it. Time spent within an <i>antimagic field</i> counts against the suppressed spell’s
      duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an <i>antimagic field.</i> They
      reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of
      the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast <i>antimagic field</i> in an area occupied by a
      summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the
      creature’s spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurationsare not affected by an
      <i>antimagic field</i> because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function
      magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems
      and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting
      (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals,
      corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures’ spell-like or
      supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field.
      <i>Dispel magic</i> does not remove the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or more <i>antimagic fields</i> sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells,
      such as <i>wall of force, prismatic sphere</i>, and <i>prismatic wall,</i> remain unaffected by
      <i>antimagic field</i> (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal
      magic such as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is
      unaffected by the field.

      You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent
      creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be
      named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled
      must be named.

    <p>
      Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected

    </p>
    <p>
      A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the
      spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but
      feels uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature’s Dexterity score by 4 points.

    <p>
      You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. You can create the <i>arcane eye</i> at
      any point you can see, but it can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. An
      <i>arcane eye</i> travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would
      (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as
      well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass
      through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye can’t enter another plane of existence, even
      through a <i>gate</i> or similar magical portal.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must concentrate to use an <i>arcane eye.</i> If you do not concentrate, the eye is inert until you again

    <p>
      This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters.
      The writing can be visible or invisible. An <i>arcane mark</i> spell enables you to etch the rune upon any
      substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a
      <i>detect magic</i> spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>See invisibility, true seeing</i>, a <i>gem of seeing</i>, or a <i>robe of eyes</i> likewise allows the user to
      see an invisible <i>arcane mark.</i> A <i>read magic</i> spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be

      This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is
      similar to that of a
      <i>detect magic</i> spell, but <i>arcane sight</i> does not require concentration and discerns aura location and
      power more quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura’s power depends on a spell’s
      functioning level or an item’s caster level, as noted in the description of the <i>detect magic</i> spell. If the
      items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the
      school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for

      If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether
      it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register
      as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available
      for use.

      By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an astral body onto another plane
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a
      circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you
      at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a
      state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral
      Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as
      you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of
      existence you have chosen to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery
      cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a
      silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly
      attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body
      where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral
      projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral
      Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a
      state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to
      end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as
      <i>dispel magic</i> cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the
      destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).

      This spell removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be
      truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act
      unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, <i>atonement</i> operates normally at no cost to you. However, in
      the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must
      intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject’s burden. Many casters
      first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see <i>geas/quest</i>) or similar penance to determine whether the
      creature is truly contrite before casting the <i>atonement</i> spell on its behalf.
    </p>
    <p><i>Atonement</i> may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Reverse Magical Alignment Change:</em> If a creature has had its alignment magically changed,
      <i>atonement</i> returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Restore Class:</em> A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her
      paladinhood restored to her by this spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers:</em> A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by
      incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by seeking <i>atonement</i> from another cleric of
      the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his
      intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Redemption or Temptation:</em> You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to
      offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire
      casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original
      alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence
      can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old
      alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment
      naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the spell description refers to evil acts, <i>atonement</i> can also be used on any creature that has
      performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of <i>atonement</i> simply offers a
      believable way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.
    </p>
    <p><em>Material Component:</em> Burning incense.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Focus:</em> In addition to your holy symbol or normal divine focus, you need a set of prayer beads (or other
      prayer device, such as a prayer wheel or prayer book) worth at least 500 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>XP Cost:</em> When cast for the benefit of a creature whose guilt was the result of deliberate acts, the cost
      to you is 500 XP per casting (see above).

      <li><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</li>
      <li><strong>Target:</strong> You</li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      An <i>augury</i> can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; this roll is
      made secretly. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have
      no chance of success. If the <i>augury</i> succeeds, you get one of four results:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).</li>
      <li>Woe (for bad results).</li>
      <li>Weal and woe (for both).</li>
      <li>Nothing (for actions that don’t have especially good or bad results).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If the spell fails, you get the “nothing” result. A cleric who gets the “nothing” result has no way to tell
      whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful <i>augury.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>augury</i> can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does
      not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated
      action. All <i>auguries</i> cast by the same person about the same topic use the same dice result as the first
      casting.
    </p>
    <p><em>Material Component:</em> Incense worth at least 25 gp.</p>
    <p><em>Focus:</em> A set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens of at least 25 gp value.</p>

      You awaken a tree or animal to humanlike sentience. To succeed, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + the animal’s
      current HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>awakened</i> animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a
      creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <i>awakened</i> tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type
      and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. An <i>awakened</i> plant gains the ability to move
      its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human’s.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <i>awakened</i> animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD. Its type becomes magical beast
      (augmented animal). An awakened animal can’t serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <i>awakened</i> tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know
      per point of Intelligence bonus (if any).

      the new form would prove fatal to the creature the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a Will save. If this second save fails, the creature loses its
      extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, loses its ability to cast spells (if it had the ability),
      and gains the alignment, special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of its new form in place
      of its own. It still retains its class and level (or HD), as well as all benefits deriving therefrom (such as base
      attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points). It retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that
      aren’t extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities.

    <p>
      A <i>binding</i> spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw
      only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts <i>suggestion</i>,
      your caster level for this casting of <i>binding</i> increases by 1. For each assistant who casts
      <i>dominate animal, dominate person,</i> or <i>dominate monster,</i> your caster level for this casting of
      <i>binding</i> increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant’s level, provided that the spell’s
      target is appropriate for a <i>binding</i> spell. Since the assistants’ spells are cast simply to improve your
      caster level for the purpose of the <i>binding</i> spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the
      assistants’ spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving
      throw and how long the <i>binding</i> lasts. All <i>binding</i> spells are dismissible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the version of <i>binding</i> you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and
      release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the
      condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s
      name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as
      level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don’t qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be
      changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are casting any of the first three versions of
      <i>binding</i> (those with limited durations), you may cast additional <i>binding</i> spells to prolong the
      effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell’s
      duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds
      on this save, all the <i>binding</i> spells it has received are broken.
    </p>
    <p>The <i>binding</i> spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Chaining:</em> The subject is confined by restraints that generate an <i>antipathy</i> spell affecting all
      creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this
      form of <i>binding</i> is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Slumber:</em> This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The
      subject does not need to eat or drink while <i>slumbering</i>, nor does it age. This form of <i>binding</i> is
      more difficult to cast than <i>chaining</i>, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell’s save DC by 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Bound Slumber:</em> This combination of <i>chaining</i> and <i>slumber</i> lasts for as long as one month per
      caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Hedged Prison:</em> The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it
      cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Metamorphosis:</em> The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a
      jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings
      and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The
      <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <i>metamorphosed</i>, nor
      does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Minimus Containment:</em> The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem,
      jar, or similar object. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while
      <i>contained</i>, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can’t dispel a <i>binding</i> spell with <i>dispel magic</i> or a similar effect, though an
      <i>antimagic field</i> or <i>Mage’s disjunction</i> affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be
      sent back to its home plane due to <i>dismissal, banishment,</i> or a similar effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Components:</em> The components for a <i>binding</i> spell vary according to the version of the spell, but
      they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page containing the spell,
      somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of <i>binding</i> used. These components can include such
      items as miniature chains of special metals, soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for <i>slumber</i> bindings), a
      bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of
      <i>binding</i> (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a
      vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.

    <p>
      This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 10 feet long. These waving members seem to spring
      forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot—including water. They grasp and entwine around
      creatures that enter the area, holding them fast and crushing them with great strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple check, opposed by the grapple check of the
      tentacles. Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with a base attack bonus equal to
      your caster level and a Strength score of 19. Thus, its grapple check modifier is equal to your caster level +8.
      The tentacles are immune to all types of damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the tentacles grapple an opponent, they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points
      of bludgeoning damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles. Even creatures who aren’t
      grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed.

    <p>
      An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force springs into existence. Any creature passing
      through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Reflex save for half damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through
      the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by
      making a successful Reflex save.
    </p>

      Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonevil extraplanar creatures within the area
      are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This
      effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the <i>blasphemy.</i> The banishment effect allows a

    <p>
      This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil foes. The weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement
      bonus for the purpose of bypassing the damage reduction of evil creatures or striking evil incorporeal creatures
      (though the spell doesn’t grant an actual enhancement bonus). The weapon also becomes good, which means it can
      bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures. (This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the
      weapon might have.) Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted, but affected projectile weapons (such as bows)
      don’t confer the benefit to the projectiles they shoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, all critical hit rolls against evil foes are automatically successful, so every threat is a critical
      hit. This last effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits,
      such as a keen weapon or a vorpal sword.

      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round/level (D)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You “blink” back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. You look as though you’re winking in
      and out of reality very quickly and at random.
    </p>
    <p><i>Blinking</i> has several effects, as follows.</p>
    <p>
      Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn’t help opponents, since you’re
      ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is
      only 20% (for concealment).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see
      and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since
      you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you’re <i>blinking</i> unless your
      attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go
      ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      While <i>blinking</i>, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto
      the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target
      any Dexterity bonus to AC.
    </p>
    <p>You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.</p>
    <p>
      While <i>blinking</i>, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material
      you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the
      nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed
      (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your
      time material.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You
      interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an
      incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and
      hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material
      Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can’t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while
      ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that
      work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.

    <p>
      The subject’s outline appears blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment (20%

    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>see invisibility</i> spell does not counteract the <i>blur</i> effect, but a <i>true seeing</i> spell does.

      Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell’s effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries
      penalties of its own).

    <p>
      This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses.
      <i>Break enchantment</i> can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level
      check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the
      creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>break enchantment</i> works only if that
      spell is 5th level or lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the effect comes from some permanent magic item
      <i>break enchantment</i> does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item’s
      effects.
