    <p>
      You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures or magic items cannot be
      created or transmuted by the
      <i>fabricate</i> spell. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used
      as the basis for the new fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level
      instead of 10 cubic feet.
    </p>
    <p>You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p>
    <p>Casting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet (or 1 cubic foot) of material to be affected by the spell.</p>
    <p>

      A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do
      not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical
      <i>darkness</i> effect functions normally), <i>blur</i>, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light
      is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The
      <i>faerie fire</i> can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The
      <i>faerie fire</i> does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

    <p>
      An invisible cone of terror causes each living creature in the area to become panicked unless it succeeds on a

      1 round.

    </ul>

    <p>
      The affected creatures or objects fall slowly.
      <i>Feather fall</i> instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent
      to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect.
      However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each
      creature’s maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as
      two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall.
      Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one
      quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell when it isn’t your turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast
      on a falling item the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the
      drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Feather fall</i> works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying
      creature.

    </ul>

    <p>
      If the target creature fails a Will saving throw, its Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1. The
      affected creature is unable to use Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or
      communicate coherently. Still, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The subject
      remains in this state until a <i>heal</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell is used to
      cancel the effect of the <i>feeblemind</i>. A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or a
      wizard, takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw.

      The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be it
      the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a
      <i>maze</i> spell. <i>Find the path</i> works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The
      location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination,
      indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell
      enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a
      <i>glyph of warding.</i> The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes
      first. <i>Find the path</i> can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a
      <i>maze</i> spell in a single round.
    </p>
    <p>
      This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the
      actions of creatures (including guardians).

      Each acorn explodes upon striking any hard surface. In addition to its regular fire damage, it deals 1 point of
      splash damage per die, and it ignites any combustible materials within 10 feet. A creature within this area that

      protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice).
    </p>
    <p>
      Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the
      attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage (if
      the <i>shield</i> protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the <i>shield</i> protects against
      cold-based attacks). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons
      with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.
    </p>
    <p>
      When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light
      equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). The color of the flames is determined randomly
      (50% chance of either color)—blue or green if the
      <i>chill shield</i> is cast, violet or blue if the <i>warm shield</i> is employed. The special powers of each
      version are as follows.

    <p>
      <em id="fire-shield--duration--warm-shield">Warm Shield:</em> The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half

      <i>Fire trap</i> creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A
      <i>fire trap</i> can ward any object that can be opened and closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When casting <i>fire trap,</i> you select a point on the object as the spell’s center. When someone other than you
      opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell’s center. The flames
      deal 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not
      harmed by this explosion.
    </p>
    <p>A <i>fire trapped</i> item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it.</p>
    <p>
      A <i>knock</i> spell does not bypass a <i>fire trap</i>. An unsuccessful <i>dispel magic</i> spell does not
      detonate the spell.

      You can use the <i>fire trapped</i> object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was
      specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a <i>fire trapped</i> object to an individual usually involves setting a
      password that you can share with friends.

    <p>
      A <i>fireball</i> spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire
      damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this
      damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the <i>fireball</i> is to burst. A
      glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid
      barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the <i>fireball</i> at that point. (An early impact
      results in an early detonation.) If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an
      arrow slit, you must “hit” the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and
      detonates prematurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>fireball</i> sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting
      points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or
      breaks through it, the <i>fireball</i> may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at
      the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

      A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this bladelike beam as if it
      were a scimitar. Attacks with the
      <i>flame blade</i> are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per two caster
      levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A
      <i>flame blade</i> can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.

      A <i>flame strike</i> produces a vertical column of divine fire roaring downward. The spell deals 1d6 points of

      divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks.

    <p>
      A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per
      round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with
      a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a
      successful Reflex save negates that damage. A <i>flaming sphere</i> rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It
      ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and
      burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere
      has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside
      unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A <i>flaming sphere</i> winks out if it exceeds the spell’s
      range.

    <p>
      The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium
      or heavy load). It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a
      <i>fly</i> spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells
      normally. The subject of a <i>fly</i> spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its
      maximum load, plus any armor it wears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats
      downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If
      not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell
      effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the <i>fly</i> spell is dispelled, but not if it is
      negated by an <i>antimagic field</i>.

      more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet
      between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out

      are confined. You can’t attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the

      This spell functions like <i>interposing hand,</i> except that the <i>forceful hand</i> pursues and pushes away
      the opponent that you designate. Treat this attack as a bull rush with a +14 bonus on the Strength check (+8 for
      Strength 27, +4 for being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets). The hand always moves with
      the opponent to push that target back the full distance allowed, and it has no speed limit. Directing the spell to
      a new target is a move action.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very strong creature could not push the hand out of its way because the latter would instantly reposition itself
      between the creature and you, but an opponent could push the hand up against you by successfully bull rushing it.

      This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once <i>foresight</i> is cast,
      you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. You are never
      surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best
      protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you
      would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.
    </p>
    <p>
      When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate
      what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in
      the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating
      (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the
      warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.

    <p>
      <i>Freezing sphere</i> creates a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks from your fingertips to the location you
      select, where it explodes in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum
      15d6) to each creature in the area. An elemental (water) creature instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per
      caster level (maximum 15d8).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the <i>freezing sphere</i> strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including
      water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet (a 10-
      foot square) per caster level (maximum 1,500 square feet). This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures
      that were swimming on the surface of frozen water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a
      full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for
      which you are holding the charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which
      time the <i>freezing sphere</i> bursts centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect).
      Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action.

      The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its material armor (including natural
      armor) becomes worthless, though its size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects
      still apply. The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic and becomes immune to poison and critical hits. It can’t
      attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. (This does not
      rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell,
      and Eschew Materials.) The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. If it has a touch
      spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the <i>gaseous form</i> spell takes effect.

      spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can’t enter water or other liquid. It also
      can’t manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active
      items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.

    <p>
      Casting a <i>gate</i> spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane
      of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.
    </p>
    <p>Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the <i>gate.</i></p>
    <p>
      The <i>gate</i> itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster’s choice), oriented in the
      direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional
      window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is
      shunted instantly to the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>gate</i> has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the <i>gate</i> from the front are transported to
      the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="gate--spell-resistance--planar-travel">Planar Travel:</em> As a mode of planar travel, a <i>gate</i> spell
      functions much like a <i>plane shift</i> spell, except that the <i>gate</i> opens precisely at the point you
      desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a <i>gate</i> from
      opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you—anyone
      who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A <i>gate</i> cannot be opened to another point on the same
      plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may hold the <i>gate</i> open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must
      concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="gate--spell-resistance--calling-creatures">Calling Creatures:</em> The second effect of the
      <i>gate</i> spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being
      or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the <i>gate</i> to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired
      creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to
      come through the <i>gate,</i> although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates
      a <i>gate</i> that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an
      XP cost (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may call either a single creature (of
      any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed
      your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster
      level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can’t be controlled. Deities and unique beings
      cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures
      rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories:
      immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can
      be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or
      pay any reward for the creature’s help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair
      trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or
      reward; see the <i>lesser planar ally</i> spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in
      “livestock” rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service,
      the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this
      is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its
      liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.

      saving throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of taking penalties to ability scores (as with
      <i>lesser geas</i>), the subject takes 3d6 points of damage each day it does not attempt to follow the
      <i>geas/quest</i>. Additionally, each day it must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened. These effects
      end 24 hours after the creature attempts to resume the <i>geas/ quest</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>remove curse</i> spell ends a <i>geas/quest</i> spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than
      your caster level. <i>Break enchantment</i> does not end a <i>geas/quest</i>, but <i>limited wish</i>,
      <i>miracle</i>, and <i>wish</i> do.
    </p>

      Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as

    </ul>

    <p>
      A <i>lesser geas</i> places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some
      action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer Hit Dice and be able to
      understand you. While a <i>geas</i> cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in
      certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>geased</i> creature must follow the given instructions until the <i>geas</i> is completed, no matter how
      long it takes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions the
      spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some
      instructions:
    </p>
    <p>
      If the subject is prevented from obeying the <i>lesser geas</i> for 24 hours, it takes a –2 penalty to each of its
      ability scores. Each day, another –2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of –8. No ability score can be reduced to
      less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the
      <i>lesser geas.</i>
    </p>

      You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit
      on raising that creature from the dead (see <i>raise dead</i>). Days spent under the influence of this spell don’t
      count against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes transporting a fallen comrade more pleasant.

      <i>Ghost sound</i> allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed
      place. You choose what type of sound <i>ghost sound</i> creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the
      sound’s basic character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster
      level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be
      created. The noise a <i>ghost sound</i> spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit.
      A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring
      lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty
      humans.
    </p>
    <p><i>Ghost sound</i> can enhance the effectiveness of a <i>silent image</i> spell.</p>

      Imbuing you with negative energy, this spell allows you to paralyze a single living humanoid for the duration of
      the spell with a successful melee touch attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living creatures (except you) in a
      10-foot-radius spread to become sickened (Fortitude negates). A <i>neutralize poison</i> spell removes the effect
      from a sickened creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench.

      You turn three normal-sized centipedes, two normal-sized spiders, or a single normal-sized scorpion into larger
      forms. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a
      spider), and all must be grown to the same size. The size to which the vermin can be grown depends on your level;
      see the table below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited
      to simple commands (“Attack,” “Defend,” “Stop,” and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears
      or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do
      otherwise, the giant vermin attack whoever or whatever is near them.

      The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the

      effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items. However, any type of spell can
      be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are
      spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a targeted
      <i>dispel magic</i> spell, but not by an area <i>dispel magic.</i> You can leave and return to the globe without
      penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely
      suppressed, not dispelled.

      If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level

    <p>
      This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A
      <i>glyph of warding</i> can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object
      without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores.
      Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, <i>glyphs</i> can be set according to physical characteristics
      (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. <i>Glyphs</i> can also be set with respect to good,
      evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level.
      <i>Glyphs</i> respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them
      ethereally. Multiple <i>glyphs</i> cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each
      can be separately warded.
    </p>
    <p>
      When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A <i>glyph</i> can
      be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed,
      the <i>glyph</i> and tracery become nearly invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Glyphs</i> cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be
      dispelled. <i>Mislead</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, and <i>nondetection</i> (and similar magical effects) can fool a
      <i>glyph</i>, though nonmagical disguises and the like can’t. <i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a
      <i>glyph of warding</i> with a DC 13 Spellcraft check. Identifying the <i>glyph</i> does not discharge it and
      allows you to know the basic nature of the <i>glyph</i> (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).

      thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for <i>glyph of warding</i>.
    </p>

      amorphous effect the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as

    <p>
      A <i>grease</i> spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the
      spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the
      creature remains within the area. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed
      with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can’t move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall),
      while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details).
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected
      by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature receives a Reflex saving throw to avoid the
      effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in
      each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the <i>greased</i> item. A creature wearing
      <i>greased</i> armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple checks made
      to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin.

    <p>
      This powerful spell is primarily used to defend your stronghold. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster
      level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a
      stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell.
      The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="guards-and-wards--spell-resistance--fog">Fog:</em> Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including
      darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures
      farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).
      Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="guards-and-wards--spell-resistance--arcane-locks">Arcane Locks:</em> All doors in the warded area are
      <i>arcane locked.</i> Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="guards-and-wards--spell-resistance--webs">Webs:</em> Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These
      strands are identical with those created by the <i>web</i> spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they
      are burned or torn away while the <i>guards and wards</i> spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for
      <i>web</i>. Spell Resistance: No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="guards-and-wards--spell-resistance--confusion">Confusion:</em> Where there are choices in direction—such
      as a corridor intersection or side passage—a minor <i>confusion</i>-type effect functions so as to make it 50%
      probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is
      an enchantment, mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="guards-and-wards--spell-resistance--lost-doors">Lost Doors:</em> One door per caster level is covered by a
      <i>silent image</i> to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell
      Resistance: No.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.</p>
    <p>
      1. <i>Dancing lights</i> in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as
      long as the <i>guards and wards</i> spell lasts. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.
    </p>
    <p>2. A <i>magic mouth</i> in two places. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.</p>
    <p>
      3. A <i>stinking cloud</i> in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10
      minutes if dispersed by wind while the <i>guards and wards</i> spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see
      text for <i>stinking cloud.</i> Spell Resistance: No.
    </p>
    <p>4. A <i>gust of wind</i> in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: Yes.</p>
    <p>
      5. A <i>suggestion</i> in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or
      passes through the area receives the <i>suggestion</i> mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell Resistance:
      Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A
      <i>dispel magic</i> cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful
      <i>Mage’s disjunction</i> destroys the entire <i>guards and wards</i> effect.

    <p>
      This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures
      in its path.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4x10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal
      damage per 10 feet. If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6x10 feet and takes 2d6 points of
      nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.
    </p>
    <p>Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6x10 feet.</p>
    <p>
      Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6x5 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Large or larger creatures may move normally within a
      <i>gust of wind</i> effect.
    </p>
    <p>A <i>gust of wind</i> can’t move a creature beyond the limit of its range.</p>
    <p>
      Any creature, regardless of size, takes a –4 penalty on ranged attacks and Listen checks in the area of a
      <i>gust of wind</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The force of the <i>gust</i> automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It
      causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those
      lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the effects noted, a <i>gust of wind</i> can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be
      expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or
      hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.
    </p>
    <p><i>Gust of wind</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
