    <p><i>Hallow</i> makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy site. This has four major effects.</p>
    <p>
      First, the site or structure is guarded by a
      <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, all Charisma checks made to turn undead gain a +4 sacred bonus, and Charisma checks to command undead take
      a –4 penalty. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. (This provision does not apply to the druid version
      of the spell.)
    </p>
    <p>Third, any dead body interred in a <i>hallowed</i> site cannot be turned into an undead creature.</p>
    <p>
      Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the
      <i>hallowed</i> site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of
      the normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures
      who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year,
      the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting <i>hallow</i> again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spell effects that may be tied to a <i>hallowed</i> site include
      <i
        >aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect evil, detect magic,
        dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge,
        protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues,</i
      >
      and <i>zone of truth</i>. Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells’ effects. (See the
      individual spell descriptions for details.)
    </p>
    <p>
      An area can receive only one <i>hallow</i> spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time.
      <i>Hallow</i> counters but does not dispel <i>unhallow</i>.

    <p>
      This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving
      throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile
      for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of
      <i>hold person</i> on a living creature). The effect is broken if the <i>halted</i> creatures are attacked or take
      damage.

    </ul>

    <p>
      <i>Harm</i> charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum
      of 150 points at 15th level). If the creature successfully saves, <i>harm</i> deals half this amount, but it
      cannot reduce the target’s hit points to less than 1.
    </p>
    <p>If used on an undead creature, <i>harm</i> acts like <i>heal</i>.</p>
    <h2 id="haste">Haste</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Transmutation</li>
      <li><strong id="haste--level">Level:</strong> Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3</li>
      <li><strong id="haste--components">Components:</strong> V, S, M</li>

      <li><strong id="haste--spell-resistance">Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (harmless)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.</p>
    <p>
      When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The
      attack is made using the creature’s full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This
      effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually
      grant an extra action, so you can’t use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>hasted</i> creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any
      condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the <i>hasted</i> creature’s modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim)
      increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject’s normal speed using that form of movement. This increase
      counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature’s jumping distance as normal for increased speed.
    </p>
    <p>Multiple <i>haste</i> effects don’t stack. <i>Haste</i> dispels and counters <i>slow.</i></p>

    </ul>

    <p>
      <i>Heal</i> enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It
      immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the Target: ability damage, blinded,
      <i>confused,</i> dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, <i>feebleminded,</i> insanity,
      nauseated, sickened, stunned, and poisoned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a
      maximum of 150 points at 15th level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Heal</i> does not remove negative levels, restore permanently drained levels, or restore permanently drained
      ability score points.
    </p>
    <p>If used against an undead creature, <i>heal</i> instead acts like <i>harm</i>.</p>

    </ul>

    <p>
      <i>Heat metal</i> makes metal extremely warm. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is
      allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature’s possession uses the creature’s saving throw
      bonus unless its own is higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is
      holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage
      (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it’s not wearing metal armor and the metal that it’s carrying weighs less
      than one-fifth of its weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same
      effect also occurs on the last round of the spell’s duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round,
      intense heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, causing
      more damage, as shown on the table below.

      You create the ghostly image of a hand, which you can send to find a creature within 5 miles. The hand then
      beckons to that creature and leads it to you if the creature is willing to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the spell is cast, the hand appears in front of you. You then specify a person (or any creature) by physical
      description, which can include race, gender, and appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or
      class. When the description is complete, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description.
      The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away she is.

    <p>
      Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it. If the subject does so, the hand points
      in your direction, indicating the most direct feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject,
      moving before it at a speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it
      disappears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If the subject chooses
      not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires
      while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on her own devices to locate
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that
      creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles,
      it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot
      engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand
      can’t pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5
      miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.

      You bring forth a great feast, including a magnificent table, chairs, service, and food and drink. The feast takes
      1 hour to consume, and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over. Every creature partaking of
      the feast is cured of all diseases, sickness, and nausea; becomes immune to poison for 12 hours; and gains 1d8
      temporary hit points +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10) after imbibing the nectar-like beverage that is

      A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to
      spells cast by evil creatures, and causing evil creatures to become blinded when they strike the subjects. This
      abjuration has four effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike
      <i>protection from evil</i>, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.
    </p>
    <p>Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.</p>
    <p>
      Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as
      <i>protection from evil</i> does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is
      blinded (Fortitude save negates, as
      <i>blindness/deafness</i>, but against <i>holy aura’s</i> save DC).

      You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and neutral creatures are harmed by the spell; good

      The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to each evil creature in the area (or 1d6
      points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to an evil outsider) and causes it to become blinded for 1 round.
      A successful Will saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the blinded effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither good nor evil, and they are not blinded. Such a
      creature can reduce that damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.

      This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts
      as a <i>+5 holy weapon</i> (+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against evil
      opponents). It also emits a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect (as the spell). If the
      <i>magic circle</i> ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically
      canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one <i>holy sword</i> at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has,
      rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This
      spell is not cumulative with <i>bless weapon</i> or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way.

      Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures, causing them to stop and stare blankly at you.
      In addition, you can use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible. Roll 2d4
      to see how many total Hit Dice of creatures you affect. Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with
      more HD. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do not need to understand you to be
      fascinated.

      If you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw. If the spell affects only a
      single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of –2.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the subject is fascinated by this spell, it reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude.
      This allows you to make a single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate with it). The
      request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you,
      but only with respect to that particular request.

      You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The
      <i>illusory script</i> appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people)
      designated by you at the time of the casting are able to read the writing; it’s unintelligible to any other
      character, although an illusionist recognizes it as
      <i>illusory script.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving
      throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation.
      Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory
      script spell was cast. The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes. Typical suggestions include “Close the book and
      leave,” “Forget the existence of the book,” and so forth. If successfully dispelled by <i>dispel magic,</i> the
      <i>illusory script</i> and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the
      <i>true seeing</i> spell with the <i>read magic</i> or <i>comprehend languages</i> spell.
    </p>
    <p>The casting time depends on how long a message you wish to write, but it is always at least 1 minute.</p>

      This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface. It appears absolutely real when
      viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps,
      or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or a probing search
      reveals the true nature of the surface, though such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear.

      You transfer some of your currently prepared spells, and the ability to cast them, to another creature. Only a
      creature with an Intelligence score of at least 5 and a Wisdom score of at least 9 can receive this bestowal. Only
      cleric spells from the schools of abjuration, divination, and conjuration (healing) can be transferred. The number
      and level of spells that the subject can be granted depends on its Hit Dice; even multiple castings of
      <i>imbue with spell ability</i> can’t exceed this limit.

      Once you cast <i>imbue with spell ability,</i> you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it until the
      recipient uses the imbued spells or is slain, or until you dismiss the <i>imbue with spell ability</i> spell. In
      the meantime, you remain responsible to your deity or your principles for the use to which the spell is put. If
      the number of 4th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active
      <i>imbue with spell ability</i> spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled.

      To cast a spell with a verbal component, the subject must be able to speak. To cast a spell with a somatic

      When you cast <i>imprisonment</i> and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the
      <i>temporal stasis</i> spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The subject remains there
      unless a <i>freedom</i> spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a
      <i>crystal ball,</i> a <i>locate object</i> spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that
      a creature is imprisoned, but <i>discern location</i> does. A <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell will not free
      the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target’s name and some facts about its life,
      the target takes a –4 penalty on its save.

    <p>
      An <i>incendiary cloud</i> spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke shot through with white-hot embers. The smoke
      obscures all sight as a <i>fog cloud</i> does. In addition, the white-hot embers within the cloud deal 4d6 points
      of fire damage to everything within the cloud on your turn each round. All targets can make Reflex saves each
      round to take half damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with a <i>cloudkill</i> spell, the smoke moves away from you at 10 feet per round. Figure out the smoke’s new
      spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from where you were when you
      cast the spell. By concentrating, you can make the cloud (actually its point of origin) move as much as 60 feet
      each round. Any portion of the cloud that would extend beyond your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing
      the remainder’s spread thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>As with <i>fog cloud</i>, wind disperses the smoke, and the spell can’t be cast underwater.</p>

      speaking a special word (set by you when the spell is cast) and crushing the gem. The item appears instantly in
      your hand. Only you can use the gem in this way.

      The inscription on the gem is invisible. It is also unreadable, except by means of a <i>read magic</i> spell, to

    <p>
      <i>Interposing hand</i> creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating,
      disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent
      tries to get around it, providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand—it sticks
      with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or
      disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <i>interposing hand</i> is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit
      points as you do when you’re undamaged, and its AC is 20 (–1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal
      creature, but most magical effects that don’t cause damage do not affect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. It cannot push through a <i>wall of force</i> or
      enter an <i>antimagic field</i>, but it suffers the full effect of a <i>prismatic wall</i> or
      <i>prismatic sphere.</i> The hand makes saving throws as its caster.
    </p>
    <p><i>Disintegrate</i> or a successful <i>dispel magic</i> destroys it.</p>
    <p>
      Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed.
      The hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the
      creature’s attacks.
    </p>
    <p>Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.</p>

    <p>
      The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is
      a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies
      can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the
      clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can
      become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject
      carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the subject is not magically <i>silenced,</i> and certain other conditions can render the recipient
      detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of
      this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a
      foe depends on the invisible character’s perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the
      spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs,
      summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge,
      remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly,
      however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as <i>bless</i> that specifically
      affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.
    </p>
    <p><i>Invisibility</i> can be made permanent (on objects only) with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>

      This spell transforms your body into living iron, which grants you several powerful resistances and abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      You gain damage reduction 15/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage,
      deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology
      or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half
      damage from acid and fire of all kinds. However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect
      iron golems.
    </p>
    <p>
      You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a –6 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a
      minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance
      of 50% and a –8 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus
      can’t use potions) or play wind instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium
      characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive

      <i>Ironwood</i> is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood. While remaining natural wood in almost
      every way, <i>ironwood</i> is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron
      do not function on <i>ironwood</i>. Spells that affect wood do affect <i>ironwood</i>, although
      <i>ironwood</i> does not burn. Using this spell with <i>wood shape</i> or a wood-related Craft check, you can
      fashion wooden items that function as steel items. Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that
      are as durable as their normal steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by druids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, if you make only half as much <i>ironwood</i> as the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or
      suit of armor so created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.

      This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles
      the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19–20, a threat range of 19–20 becomes 17–20, and a
      threat range of 18–20 becomes 15–20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows
      or crossbow bolts, the
      <i>keen edge</i> on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended
      target. (Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Multiple effects that increase a weapon’s threat range (such as the
      <i>keen edge</i> spell and the Improved Critical feat) don’t stack. You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon,
      such as a claw.

      The <i>knock</i> spell opens stuck, barred, locked, <i>held,</i> or <i>arcane locked</i> doors. It opens secret
      doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided
      they serve to hold closures shut). If used to open a <i>arcane locked</i> door, the spell does not remove the
      <i>arcane lock</i> but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not
      relock itself or become stuck again on its own. <i>Knock</i> does not raise barred gates or similar impediments
      (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each
      spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress.

      You instantly know the direction of north from your current position. The spell is effective in any environment in
      which “north” exists, but it may not work in extraplanar settings. Your knowledge of north is correct at the
      moment of casting, but you can get lost again within moments if you don’t find some external reference point to

      <i>Legend lore</i> brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing
      is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4x10 minutes. If you have only
      detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less
      complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing,
      thus allowing a better <i>legend lore</i> result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6
      weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information,
      thus allowing a better <i>legend lore</i> result next time).
    </p>
    <p>
      During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When
      completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be
      legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been
      generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule
      of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are “legendary,” as are the sorts of creatures they contend
      with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.

      <i>Levitate</i> allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature
      must be willing to be <i>levitated,</i> and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You
      can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You
      cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or
      push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>levitating</i> creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the
      first attack has a –1 penalty on attack rolls, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of –5. A full round
      spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at –1.

      The <i>lightning bolt</i> sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low

      A <i>limited wish</i> lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a <i>limited wish</i> can do any of
      the following things.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to

      <li>Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower, even if it’s of a prohibited school.</li>
      <li>Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as <i>geas/quest</i> or <i>insanity</i>.</li>
      <li>
        Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature
        automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a –7 penalty on its next saving throw.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal (but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell).
      When a
      <i>limited wish</i> duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost or 300 XP, whichever is more.
      When a <i>limited wish</i> spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you
      must provide that component.

      This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell can be cast on only a single tree at a time;
      while <i>liveoak</i> is in effect, you can’t cast it again on another tree. The tree on which the spell is cast
      must be within 10 feet of your dwelling place, within a place sacred to you, or within 300 feet of something that
      you wish to guard or protect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Liveoak</i> must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is
      placed on the targeted oak. The <i>liveoak</i> spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <i>liveoak</i> is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately, wherever it happens to be. If released by you,
      the tree tries to return to its original location before taking root.

    <p>
      The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature
      of a certain type. To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at
      least once.

      You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. You can search for general items, in which
      case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain item
      requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell
      fails. You cannot specify a unique item unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not through
      divination).
