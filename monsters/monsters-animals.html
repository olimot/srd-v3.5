    <h1>MONSTERS (ANIMALS)</h1>
    <p>
      This section provides statistics and basic information for many common kinds of mundane animals. These creatures
      generally operate on instinct, driven by simple needs such as food and reproduction. Most animals, even predators,
      do not attack unless they or their young are threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Animals are not capable of detailed reasoning, although with the Handle Animal skill it is possible to tame an
      animal and teach it to perform certain tricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some herbivorous animals do not normally use their natural weapons to attack. As such, their natural weapons are
      treated as secondary attacks. The animal’s attack and damage entries note this fact, with an explanatory footnote.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="animal-traits">Animal Traits:</strong> An animal possesses the following traits (unless otherwise
      noted in a creature’s entry).
    </p>
    <p>—Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher can be an animal).</p>
    <p>—Low-light vision.</p>
    <p>—<i>Alignment:</i> Always neutral. Animals are not governed by a human sense of morality.</p>
    <p>—<i>Treasure:</i> None. Animals never possess treasure.</p>

      Baboons are powerful and aggressive primates adapted to life on the ground. They prefer open spaces but climb
      trees to find safe places to rest overnight. A typical baboon is the size of a big dog.

      must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack
      of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, the crocodile establishes a hold on the opponent with its mouth and
      drags it into deep water, attempting to pin it to the bottom.

      <strong id="crocodile--combat--hold-breath-ex">Hold Breath (Ex):</strong> A crocodile can hold its breath for a

      perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted
      or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. *A crocodile gains
      a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks when in the water. Further, a crocodile can lie in the water with only its eyes
      and nostrils showing, gaining a +10 cover bonus on Hide checks.

      the sunder attempt. Severing one of a giant octopus’s tentacles deals 5 points of damage to the creature. A giant

      high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them to locate objects and creatures within

      approximately as good as a human’s.

      An opponent can attack a giant squid’s tentacles with a sunder attempt as if they were weapons. A giant squid’s

      These little mammals are aggressive predators but usually confine themselves to smaller prey. The statistics
      presented here can also apply to ferrets.
    </p>
    <h3 id="weasel--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      <strong id="weasel--combat--attach-ex">Attach (Ex):</strong> If a weasel hits with a bite attack, it uses its
      powerful jaws to latch onto the opponent’s body and automatically deals bite damage each round it remains
      attached. An attached weasel loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class and has an AC of 12. An attached weasel can
      be struck with a weapon or grappled itself. To remove an attached weasel through grappling, the opponent must
      achieve a pin against the creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weasel--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> Weasels have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks and a
      +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks. They use their Dexterity modifier for Climb checks. A weasel can
      always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.
    </p>
    <h2 id="whale">Whale</h2>
    <p>
      Some varieties of these seagoing mammals are among the largest animals known. Relatively small whales (such as the
      orca presented here) can be vicious predators, attacking virtually anything they detect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="whale--blindsight-ex">Blindsight (Ex):</strong> Whales can “see” by emitting high-frequency sounds,
      inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them to locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A
      <i>silence</i> spell negates this and forces the whale to rely on its vision, which is approximately as good as a
      human’s.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="whale--hold-breath-ex">Hold Breath (Ex):</strong> A whale can hold its breath for a number of rounds
      equal to 8 x its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="whale--skills">Skills:</strong> A whale has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some
      special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or
      endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. *A whale has a +4
      racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated.

    <h3 id="wolf--combat">Combat</h3>

      A favorite tactic is to send a few individuals against the foe’s front while the rest of the pack circles and
      attacks from the flanks or rear.
