      Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 600 to 650 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dull yellow to dull
      brown. Their clothing consists of poorly cured furs and hides, which add to their naturally repellent odor.
    </p>
    <p>Ogres speak Giant, and those specimens who boast Intelligence scores of at least 10 also speak Common.</p>
    <h3 id="ogre--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Ogres favor overwhelming odds, sneak attacks, and ambushes over a fair fight. They are intelligent enough to fire
      ranged weapons first to soften up their foes before closing, but ogre gangs and bands fight as unorganized
      individuals.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ogre--ogre-barbarian">Ogre Barbarian</h3>
    <p>
      Their inherent bent toward chaos combines with their size and strength to make ogres natural barbarians. Indeed,
      their leaders are almost always barbarians of low to middle level, monstrous brutes whose fury in battle is truly
      fearsome. A raging ogre barbarian is an inspiration to other ogres.
    </p>
    <h4 id="ogre--ogre-barbarian--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Marginally more intelligent than his brutish fellows, an ogre barbarian is slightly more likely to enter a fair
      fight, but in general prefers the brutish tactics common to all its kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ogre--ogre-barbarian--combat--rage-ex">Rage (Ex):</strong> Twice per day, an ogre barbarian can enter
      a state of fierce rage that last for 9 rounds. The following changes are in effect as long as he rages: AC 17
      (touch 8, flat-footed 17); hp 95; Atk +18/+13 melee (2d6+16, <i>+1 greatclub</i>); SV Fort +14, Will +4; Str 30,
      Con 22; Climb +15, Jump +16. At the end of his rage, the ogre barbarian is fatigued for the duration of the
      encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ogre--ogre-barbarian--combat--trap-sense-ex">Trap Sense (Ex):</strong> An ogre barbarian has a +1
      bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps. He also has a +1 bonus to his AC against attacks by traps.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ogre--ogre-barbarian--combat--uncanny-dodge-ex">Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> An ogre barbarian retains
      his Dex bonus to AC regardless of being caught flat-footed or attacked by an invisible opponent. His Dex bonus to
      AC is +0, but this means that he is not subject to a rogue’s sneak attack in these circumstances.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ogre--merrow">Merrow</h3>
    <p>These cousins of the ogre have the aquatic subtype.</p>
    <p>
      They dwell in freshwater lakes and rivers. They have a base land speed of 30 feet and a swim speed of 40 feet and
      are found only in aquatic environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of the typical ogre’s greatclub, they prefer to use longspears in melee (attack +8 melee, damage 1d8+7).
    </p>
    <h3 id="ogre--ogres-as-characters">Ogres as Characters</h3>
    <p>Ogre characters possess the following racial traits.</p>
    <p>— +10 Strength, –2 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, –4 Intelligence, –4 Charisma.</p>
    <p>
      —Large size. –1 penalty to Armor Class, –1 penalty on attack rolls, –4 penalty on Hide checks, +4 bonus on grapple
      checks, lifting and carrying limits double those of Medium characters.
    </p>
    <p>—Space/Reach: 10 feet/10 feet.</p>
    <p>—An ogre’s base land speed is 40 feet.</p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>
      —Racial Hit Dice: An ogre begins with four levels of giant, which provide 4d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +3,
      and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +4, Ref +1, and Will +1.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Racial Skills: An ogre’s giant levels give it skill points equal to 7 x (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1). Its class
      skills are Climb, Listen, and Spot.
    </p>
    <p>—Racial Feats: An ogre’s giant levels give it two feats.</p>
    <p>
      —Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An ogre is automatically proficient with simple weapons, martial weapons, light and
      medium armor, and shields.
    </p>
    <p>— +5 natural armor bonus.</p>
    <p>—Automatic Languages: Common, Giant. Bonus Languages: Dwarven, Orc, Goblin, Terran.</p>
    <p>—Favored Class: Barbarian.</p>
    <p>—Level adjustment +2.</p>

    <p>The ogre mage is a more intelligent and dangerous variety of its mundane cousin.</p>
    <p>
      An ogre mage stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to 700 pounds. Its skin varies in color from light green to
      light blue, and its hair is black or very dark brown. Ogre mages favor loose, comfortable clothing and lightweight
      armor.
    </p>
    <p>Ogre mages speak Giant and Common.</p>
    <h3 id="ogre-mage--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Ogre mages rely on their spell-like abilities, resorting to physical combat only when necessary. When faced with
      obviously superior forces, they prefer to retreat using <i>gaseous form</i> rather than fight a losing battle.

    <p>
      An ogre mage that loses a limb or body part can reattach it by holding the severed member to the stump.
      Reattachment takes 1 minute. If the head or some other vital organ is severed, it must be reattached within 10
      minutes or the creature dies. An ogre mage cannot regrow lost body parts.

      Oozes are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They inhabit underground areas throughout the world, scouring

    <h3 id="ooze--combat">Combat</h3>

      Oozes attack any creatures they encounter. They lash out with pseudopods or simply engulf opponents with their

      cover. Opponents can make opportunity attacks against the cube, but if they do so they are not entitled to a
      saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC 13 Reflex save or be engulfed;
      on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent’s choice) as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are
      subject to the cube’s paralysis and acid, and are considered to be grappled and trapped within its body. The save

      An orc’s hair usually is black. It has lupine ears and reddish eyes. Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that many
      humans would consider unpleasant, such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. Their
      equipment is dirty and unkempt. An adult male orc is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 210 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>Females are slightly smaller.</p>
    <p>
      The language an orc speaks varies slightly from tribe to tribe, but any orc is understandable by someone else who
      speaks Orc. Some orcs know Goblin or Giant as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most orcs encountered away from their homes are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of
      1st level.

    <p>
      Orcs are proficient with all simple weapons, preferring those that cause the most damage in the least time. Many
      orcs who take up the warrior or fighter class also gain proficiency with the falchion or the greataxe as a martial
      weapon. They enjoy attacking from concealment and setting ambushes, and they obey the rules of war (such as
      honoring a truce) only as long as it is convenient for them.

      These orc–human crossbreeds can be found in either orc or human society (where their status varies according to

      characteristics of their parents. They are as tall as humans and a little heavier, thanks to their muscle. They
      have greenish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and coarse body hair. Half-orcs who
      have lived among or near orcs have scars, in keeping with orcish tradition.

      Giant owls are nocturnal birds of prey, feared for their ability to hunt and attack in near silence. They are
      intelligent, and though naturally suspicious, sometimes associate with good creatures. A typical giant owl stands
      about 9 feet tall, has a wingspan of up to 20 feet, and resembles its smaller cousins in nearly every way except
      size.
    </p>
    <p>Giant owls speak Common and Sylvan.</p>
    <h3 id="owl-giant--combat">Combat</h3>

    <h3 id="owl-giant--training-a-giant-owl">Training a Giant Owl</h3>
    <p>
      Although intelligent, a giant owl requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a giant
      owl must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check).
      Training a friendly giant owl requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a giant owl
      requires an exotic saddle. A giant owl can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless
      he or she succeeds on a Ride check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giant owl eggs are worth 2,500 gp apiece on the open market, while chicks are worth 4,000 gp each. Professional
      trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a giant owl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="owl-giant--training-a-giant-owl--carrying-capacity">Carrying Capacity:</strong> A light load for a
      giant owl is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601–900 pounds.

      An owlbear’s coat ranges in color from brown-black to yellowish brown; its beak is a dull ivory color. A
      full-grown male can stand as tall as 8 feet and weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Adventurers who have survived encounters

      Owlbears attack prey—any creature bigger than a mouse—on sight, always fighting to the death. They slash with

      The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the cause of good. Though highly prized as aerial
      steeds, pegasi are wild and shy creatures not easily tamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Pegasi
      cannot speak, but they understand Common.

    <h3 id="pegasus--training-a-pegasus">Training a Pegasus</h3>
    <p>
      Although intelligent, a pegasus requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a pegasus
      must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check).
      Training a friendly pegasus requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a pegasus requires
      an exotic saddle. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she
      succeeds on a Ride check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pegasus eggs are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp per head. Pegasi mature at
      the same rate as horses. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which serves a good or
      neutral master with absolute faithfulness for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="pegasus--training-a-pegasus--carrying-capacity">Carrying Capacity:</strong> A light load for a pegasus
      is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601–900 pounds.

      This creature looks like a brown and greenish-brown mass with a cluster of nodules atop the main mass, though it

      A phasm is an amorphous creature that can assume the guise of almost any other creature or object. A phasm in its
      natural form is about 5 feet in diameter and 2 feet high at the center. Swirls of color indicate sensory organs.
      In this form, a phasm slithers about like an ooze and can attack with a pseudopod. It weighs about 400 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>Phasms can speak Common but prefer telepathic communication.</p>
    <h3 id="phasm--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      When faced with potential danger, a phasm is equally likely to retreat, parley, or attack, as its fancy strikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If pursued or harassed, a phasm transforms into the most fearsome creature it knows and attacks. When seriously

    <h2 id="planetouched">Planetouched</h2>
    <p>
      Planetouched is a general word to describe someone who can trace his or her bloodline back to an outsider, usually
      a fiend or celestial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effects of having a supernatural being in one’s heritage last for many generations. Although not as
      dramatically altered as a half-celestial or a half-fiend, planetouched still retain some special qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two planetouched varieties described here are the most common. Aasimars are humans with some trace of
      celestial blood in their veins, and tieflings have some fiendishness in their family tree.

      Aasimars are usually tall, good-looking, and generally pleasant. Some have a minor physical trait suggesting their
      heritage, such as silver hair, golden eyes, or an unnaturally intense stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most aasimars are decidedly good-aligned. They fight against evil causes and attempt to sway others to do the
      right thing. Occasionally they take on the vengeful, judgmental aspect of their celestial ancestor, but this is
      rare.
    </p>

      A closer look at a rakshasa reveals that the palms of its hands are where the backs of the hands would be on a
      human.
    </p>
    <p>A rakshasa is about the same height and weight as a human.</p>
    <p>Rakshasas speak Common, Infernal, and Undercommon.</p>
    <h3 id="rakshasa--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      In close combat, which a rakshasa disdains as ignoble, it employs its sharp claws and powerful bite. Whenever
      possible, it uses its other abilities to make such encounters unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="rakshasa--combat--detect-thoughts-su">Detect Thoughts (Su):</strong> A rakshasa can continuously use
      detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 15 negates). It can suppress or resume this ability as a
      free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong id="rakshasa--combat--change-shape-su">Change Shape (Su):</strong> A rakshasa can assume any humanoid
      form, or revert to its own form, as a standard action. In humanoid form, a rakshasa loses its claw and bite
      attacks (although it often equips itself with weapons and armor instead). A rakshasa remains in one form until it
      chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but the rakshasa reverts to its natural form
      when killed. A <i>true seeing</i> spell reveals its natural form.

      checks. *When using change shape, a rakshasa gains an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If

    </p>
    <h3 id="rakshasa--rakshasas-as-characters">Rakshasas as Characters</h3>
    <p>Rakshasa characters possess the following racial traits.</p>

    <p>—Medium size.</p>
    <p>—A rakshasa’s base land speed is 40 feet.</p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>
      —Racial Hit Dice: A rakshasa begins with seven levels of outsider, which provide 7d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus
      of +7, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +5, Ref +5, and Will +5.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Racial Skills: A rakshasa’s outsider levels give it skill points equal to 10 x (8 + Int modifier). Its class
      skills are Bluff, Disguise, Listen, Move Silently, Perform, Sense Motive, and Spot. A rakshasa has a +4 racial
      bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks, and it can gain further bonuses by using change shape (+10 on Disguise checks)
      and detect thoughts (+4 on Bluff and Disguise checks).
    </p>
    <p>—Racial Feats: A rakshasa’s outsider levels give it three feats.</p>

    <p>—Detect Thoughts (Su): The save DC is 13 + the character’s Cha modifier.</p>
    <p>
      —Spells: A rakshasa character casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer. If the character takes additional levels of
      sorcerer, these levels stack with the rakshasa’s base spellcasting ability for spells known, spells per day, and
      other effects dependent on caster level. A rakshasa character likewise uses the sum of its

      Ravids are creatures from the Positive Energy Plane. These bizarre entities imbue creatures with energy by their
      touch and animate lifeless objects around them. Ravids that make their way to the Material Plane wander about
      aimlessly, followed by the objects to which they have given life.
    </p>
    <p>A ravid is about 7 feet long and weighs about 75 pounds.</p>
    <h3 id="ravid--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Ravids fight only in self-defense. A ravid itself is not very powerful but is always accompanied by at least one
      animated object that defends it.

    <p>
      <strong id="ravid--combat--positive-energy-lash-su">Positive Energy Lash (Su):</strong> A ravid can make a touch
      attack or hit with a claw or tail slap attack to infuse a target with positive energy. The energy produces an
      unpleasant tingle in living creatures, and against undead foes (even incorporeal ones) it deals 2d10 points of
      damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Animate Objects (Su): Once per round, a random object within 20 feet of a ravid animates as though by the spell
      <i>animate objects</i> (caster level 20th). These objects defend the ravid to the best of their ability, but the
      ravid isn’t intelligent enough to employ elaborate tactics with them.

      A remorhaz is whitish-blue in color but pulses with a reddish glow from the heat its body produces. The creature
      is a little more than 20 feet long, with a body about 5 feet wide. It weighs about 10,000 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>Remorhazes cannot speak.</p>
    <h3 id="remorhaz--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Remorhazes hide under the snow and ice until they hear movement above them, then attack from below and surprise
      prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="remorhaz--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a remorhaz must
      hit an opponent least one size category smaller than itself with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a
      grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes
      a hold and can attempt to swallow the opponent the following round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="remorhaz--combat--swallow-whole-ex">Swallow Whole (Ex):</strong> When a remorhaz begins its turn with
      a grappled opponent in its mouth, it can swallow that opponent with a successful grapple check. Once inside, the
      opponent takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage plus 8d6 points of fire damage per round from the remorhaz’s
      gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points
      of damage to the gizzard (AC 15). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed
      opponent must cut its own way out. A Huge remorhaz’s interior can hold 2 Large, 4 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, 128
      Diminutive, or 512 Fine or smaller opponents.

    <p>
      <strong id="remorhaz--combat--heat-ex">Heat (Ex):</strong> An enraged remorhaz generates heat so intense that
      anything touching its body takes 8d6 points of fire damage. Creatures striking a remorhaz with natural attacks or
      unarmed attacks are subject to this damage, but creatures striking with melee weapons do not take damage from the
      remorhaz’s heat. This heat can melt or char weapons; any weapon that strikes a remorhaz is allowed a DC 18
      Fortitude save to avoid destruction. The save DC is Constitution-based. Skills: Remorhazes have a +4 racial bonus
      on Listen checks.

      A roc’s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail. These enormous creatures are 30 feet long from

      A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself
      and its young to devour. A solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack any Medium or larger creature that
      appears edible. A mated pair of rocs attack in concert, fighting to the death to defend their nests or hatchlings.

      A roper stands some 9 feet tall and tapers from 3 or 4 feet in diameter at the base to 1 foot across at the top.
      It weighs 2,200 pounds. A roper’s coloration and temperature change to match the features of the surrounding cave.
    </p>
    <p>Ropers speak Terran and Undercommon.</p>
    <h3 id="roper--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A roper hunts by standing very still and imitating a bit of rock. This tactic often allows it to attack with
      surprise. When prey comes within reach, it lashes out with its strands. In melee, it bites adjacent opponents with
      its powerful maw.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="roper--combat--drag-ex">Drag (Ex):</strong> If a roper hits with a strand attack, the strand latches
      onto the opponent’s body. This deals no damage but drags the stuck opponent 10 feet closer each subsequent round
      (provoking no attack of opportunity) unless that creature breaks free, which requires a DC 23 Escape Artist check
      or a DC 19 Strength check. The check DCs are Strength-based, and the Escape Artist DC includes a +4 racial bonus.
      A roper can draw in a creature within 10 feet of itself and bite with a +4 attack bonus in the same round. A
      strand has 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. However, attacking a roper’s
      strand does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the strand is currently attached to a target, the roper takes
      a –4 penalty on its opposed attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a strand deals no damage to a
      roper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="roper--combat--strands-ex">Strands (Ex):</strong> Most encounters with a roper begin when it fires
      strong, sticky strands. The creature can have up to six strands at once, and they can strike up to 50 feet away
      (no range increment). If a strand is severed, the roper can extrude a new one on its next turn as a free action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="roper--combat--weakness-ex">Weakness (Ex):</strong> A roper’s strands can sap an opponent’s strength.
      Anyone grabbed by a strand must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of Strength damage. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>

      The hide of these creatures varies in color from a yellowish tan underside to a rust-red upper back. A rust
      monster’s prehensile antennae can rust metals on contact.

      A rust monster can scent a metal object from up to 90 feet away. When it detects one, it dashes toward the source
      and attempts to strike it with its antennae. The creature is relentless, chasing characters over long distances if
      they still possess intact metal objects but usually ceasing its attacks to devour a freshly rusted meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creature targets the largest metal object available, striking first at armor, then at shields and smaller
      items. It prefers ferrous metals (steel or iron) over precious metals (such as gold or silver) but will devour the
      latter if given the opportunity.

      <strong id="rust-monster--combat--rust-ex">Rust (Ex):</strong> A rust monster that makes a successful touch attack
