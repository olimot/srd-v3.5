    <p>
      Most sahuagin feature green coloration, darker along the back and lighter on the belly. Many have dark stripes,
      bands, or spots, but these tend to fade with age. An adult male sahuagin stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs
      about 200 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sahuagin are the natural enemy of aquatic elves. The two cannot coexist peacefully: Wars between them are
      prolonged, bloody affairs that sometimes interfere with shipping and maritime trade. Sahuagin have an only
      slightly less vehement hatred for tritons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sahuagin speak their own language, Sahuagin. Thanks to their high Intelligence scores, most sahuagin also speak
      two bonus languages, usually Common and Aquan.
    </p>
    <h3 id="sahuagin--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Sahuagin are savage fighters, asking for and giving no quarter. When swimming, a sahuagin tears with its feet as
      it strikes with its talons or a weapon. About half of any group of sahuagin are also armed with nets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="sahuagin--combat--blindsense-ex">Blindsense (Ex):</strong> A sahuagin can locate creatures underwater
      within a 30-foot radius. This ability works only when the sahuagin is underwater.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="sahuagin--combat--blood-frenzy">Blood Frenzy:</strong> Once per day a sahuagin that takes damage in
      combat can fly into a frenzy in the following round, clawing and biting madly until either it or its opponent is
      dead. It gains +2 Constitution and +2 Strength, and takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. A sahuagin cannot end its
      frenzy voluntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="sahuagin--combat--rake-ex">Rake (Ex):</strong> Attack bonus +2 melee, damage 1d4+1. A sahuagin also
      gains two rake attacks when it attacks while swimming.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="sahuagin--combat--freshwater-sensitivity-ex">Freshwater Sensitivity (Ex):</strong> A sahuagin fully
      immersed in fresh water must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become fatigued. Even on a success, it must
      repeat the save attempt every 10 minutes it remains immersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="sahuagin--combat--light-blindness-ex">Light Blindness (Ex):</strong> Abrupt exposure to bright light
      (such as sunlight or a <i>daylight</i> spell) blinds sahuagin for round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled
      while operating in bright light.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="sahuagin--combat--speak-with-sharks-ex">Speak with Sharks (Ex):</strong> Sahuagin can communicate
      telepathically with sharks up to 150 feet away. The communication is limited to fairly simple concepts such as
      “food,” “danger,” and “enemy.” Sahuagin can use the Handle Animal skill to befriend and train sharks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="sahuagin--combat--water-dependent-ex">Water Dependent (Ex):</strong> Sahuagin can survive out of the
      water for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution (after that, refer to the drowning rules on page 304 of the
      <i>Dungeon Master ’s Guide</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="sahuagin--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> A sahuagin has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
      perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted
      or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
    </p>
    <p>*Underwater, a sahuagin has a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot checks.</p>
    <p>*A sahuagin has a +4 racial bonus on Survival and Profession (hunter) checks within 50 miles of its home.</p>
    <p>*A sahuagin has a +4 racial bonus on Handle Animal checks when working with sharks.</p>
    <h3 id="sahuagin--sahuagin-mutants">Sahuagin Mutants</h3>
    <p>
      About one in two hundred sahuagin has four arms. Such creatures can make four claw attacks or use extra weapons,
      in addition to the claw and bite attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a community of aquatic elves is located within 100 miles of a sahuagin community, about one in one hundred
      sahuagin looks just like an aquatic elf. These creatures, called malenti, have a swim speed of 40 feet, can remain
      out of water for 1 hour per point of Constitution, and have freshwater sensitivity and light sensitivity (dazzled
      in bright light). Malenti have no natural attacks. They are otherwise identical with sahuagin.

      A satyr’s hair is red or chestnut brown, while its hooves and horns are jet black. A satyr is about as tall and
      heavy as a half-elf.
    </p>
    <p>Satyrs speak Sylvan, and most also speak Common.</p>
    <h3 id="satyr--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      The keen senses of a satyr make it almost impossible to surprise one in the wild. Conversely, with their own
      natural grace and agility, satyrs can sneak up on travelers who are not carefully watching the surrounding
      wilderness. Once engaged in battle, an unarmed satyr attacks with a powerful head butt. A satyr expecting trouble
      is likely to be armed with a bow and a dagger and typically looses arrows from hiding, weakening an enemy before
      closing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="satyr--combat--pipes-su">Pipes (Su):</strong> Satyrs can play a variety of magical tunes on their pan
      pipes. Usually, only one satyr in a group carries pipes. When it plays, all creatures within a 60-foot spread
      (except satyrs) must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected by <i>charm person, sleep,</i> or
      <i>fear</i> (caster level 10th; the satyr chooses the tune and its effect).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hands of other beings, these pipes have no special powers. A creature that successfully saves against any
      of the pipe’s effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="satyr--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> Satyrs have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently,
      Perform, and Spot checks.
    </p>
    <h3 id="satyr--satyrs-as-characters">Satyrs as Characters</h3>
    <p>Satyr characters possess the following racial traits.</p>
    <p>— +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma.</p>
    <p>—Medium size.</p>
    <p>—A satyr’s base land speed is 40 feet.</p>
    <p>—Low-light vision.</p>
    <p>
      —Racial Hit Dice: A satyr begins with five levels of fey, which provide 5d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2,
      and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +4, and Will +4.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Racial Skills: A satyr’s fey levels give it skill points equal to 8 x (6 + Int modifier). Its class skills are
      Bluff, Hide, Knowledge (nature), Listen, Move Silently, Perform, and Spot. Satyrs have a +4 racial bonus on Hide,
      Listen, Move Silently, Perform, and Spot checks.
    </p>
    <p>—Racial Feats: A satyr’s fey levels give it two feats. A satyr receives Alertness as a bonus feat.</p>
    <p>— +4 natural armor bonus.</p>
    <p>—Natural Weapons: Head butt (1d6).</p>
    <p>—Special Attacks (see above): Pipes.</p>

    <p>
      Sea cats attack on sight, either for food or to defend their territory, and use both claws and teeth to grab and
      rend their prey. They display tremendous courage, always fighting to the death, even against creatures many times

    <p>
      Created by spellcasters to be bodyguards, shield guardians are constructs that protect their masters with spells
      and stamina. When it is fashioned, a shield guardian is keyed to a particular magical amulet. Henceforth, it
      regards the wearer of that amulet to be its master, protecting and following that individual everywhere (unless
      specifically commanded not to do so).
    </p>
    <p>
      A shield guardian obeys its master’s verbal commands to the best of its ability, although it is not good for much
      beyond combat and possibly simple manual labor. It can also be keyed to perform specific tasks at specific times
      or when certain conditions are met. The wearer of the amulet can call the shield guardian from any distance, and
      it will come as long as it is on the same plane.
    </p>
    <p>A shield guardian is some 9 feet tall and weighs more than 1,200 pounds.</p>
    <p>Shield guardians cannot speak, but they understand commands given in any language.</p>
    <h3 id="shield-guardian--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Shield guardians are straightforward in battle, bashing with their heavy stone fists. They are made for defense
      and are not particularly impressive on offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="shield-guardian--combat--find-master-su">Find Master (Su):</strong> As long as a shield guardian and
      its amulet are on the same plane, the shield guardian can find the amulet wearer (or just the amulet, if it is
      removed after the guardian is called).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="shield-guardian--combat--guard-ex">Guard (Ex):</strong> If ordered to do so, a shield guardian moves
      swiftly to defend the wearer of its amulet, blocking blows and disrupting foes. All attacks against the amulet
      wearer take a –2 penalty when the shield guardian is adjacent to its master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="shield-guardian--combat--shield-other-sp"><i>Shield Other</i> (Sp):</strong> The wearer of a shield
      guardian’s amulet can activate this defensive ability if within 100 feet of the shield guardian. Just as the spell
      of the same name, this ability transfers to the shield guardian half the damage that would be dealt to the amulet
      wearer (this ability does not provide the spell’s AC or save bonuses).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="shield-guardian--combat--spell-storing-sp"><i>Spell Storing</i> (Sp):</strong> A shield guardian can
      store one spell of 4th level or lower that is cast into it by another creature. It “casts” this spell when
      commanded to do so or when a predefined situation arises. Once this spell is used, the shield guardian can store
      another spell (or the same spell again).
    </p>
    <h3 id="shield-guardian--construction">Construction</h3>
    <p>A shield guardian is built from wood, bronze, stone, and steel. The materials cost 5,000 gp.</p>
    <p>
      The creature’s master may assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. Creating the body requires a DC 16
      Craft (blacksmithing) or Craft (carpentry) check. The keyed amulet is fashioned at the same time, and its cost
      (20,000 gp) is included in the cost of the guardian. After the body is sculpted, the shield guardian is animated
      through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an
      alchemist’s laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature’s
      body, the building and the ritual can be performed together. A shield guardian with more than 15 Hit Dice can be
      created, but each additional Hit Die adds +5,000 gp to the market price, and the price increases by +20,000 gp if
      the creature’s size increases to Huge, modifying the cost to create accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      CL 15th; Craft Construct,
      <i>limited wish, discern location, shield, shield other,</i> caster must be at least 15th level; Price 120,000 gp;
      Cost 65,000 gp + 4,600 XP.
    </p>
    <h3 id="shield-guardian--amulet">Amulet</h3>
    <p>
      If a shield guardian’s amulet is destroyed, the guardian ceases to function until a new one is created. If the
      wearer dies but the amulet is intact, the shield guardian carries out the last command it was given.

      A shocker lizard has a pale gray or blue underside, shading to a darker hue on its back. It has blue-black
      markings along its back and tail. A shocker lizard is about 1 foot tall at the shoulder and weighs about 25
      pounds.
    </p>
    <h3 id="shocker-lizard--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A shocker lizard relies on its electricity abilities in combat. A lizard tends to bite only after its shock has
      rendered an opponent unconscious or when the shock seems to have no effect at all. A solitary lizard flees once it
      delivers its shocks, but if other shocker lizards are nearby, they all home in on their comrade’s discharges and
      attempt to administer their shocks to the foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="shocker-lizard--combat--stunning-shock-su">Stunning Shock (Su):</strong> Once per round, a shocker
      lizard can deliver an electrical shock to a single opponent within 5 feet. This attack deals 2d8 points of
      nonlethal damage to living opponents (Reflex DC 12 half ). The save DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>

      <strong id="shocker-lizard--combat--lethal-shock-su">Lethal Shock (Su):</strong> Whenever two or more shocker
      lizards are within 20 feet of each other, they can work together to create a lethal shock. This effect has a
      radius of 20 feet, centered on any one contributing lizard. The shock deals 2d8 points of electricity damage for
      each lizard contributing to it, to a maximum of 12d8. A Reflex save (DC 10 + number of lizards contributing)
      reduces the damage by half.

    <p>Skeletons are the animated bones of the dead, mindless automatons that obey the orders of their evil masters.</p>
    <p>
      A skeleton is seldom garbed in anything more than the rotting remnants of any clothing or armor it was wearing
      when slain. A skeleton does only what it is ordered to do. It can draw no conclusions of its own and takes no
      initiative. Because of this limitation, its instructions must always be simple. A skeleton attacks until

      <strong id="skeleton--creating-a-skeleton--attacks">Attacks:</strong> A skeleton retains all the natural weapons,
      manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature, except for attacks that can’t work
      without flesh. A creature with hands gains one claw attack per hand; the skeleton can strike with each of its claw
      attacks at its full attack bonus. A skeleton’s base attack bonus is equal to 1/2 its Hit Dice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skeleton--creating-a-skeleton--damage">Damage:</strong> Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage
      normally. A claw attack deals damage depending on the skeleton’s size. (If the base creature already had claw
      attacks with its hands, use the skeleton claw damage only if it’s better.)

      A spectre looks much as it did in life and can be easily recognized by those who knew the individual or have seen
      the individual’s face in a painting or a drawing. In many cases, the evidence of a violent death is visible on its
      body. A spectre is roughly human-sized and is weightless.
    </p>
    <h3 id="spectre--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      In close combat a spectre attacks with its numbing, life-draining touch. It makes full use of its incorporeal
      nature, moving through walls, ceilings, and floors as it attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="spectre--combat--energy-drain-su">Energy Drain (Su):</strong> Living creatures hit by a spectre’s
      incorporeal touch attack gain two negative levels. The DC is 15 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level.
      The save DC is Charisma-based. For each such negative level bestowed, the spectre gains 5 temporary hit points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="spectre--combat--create-spawn-su">Create Spawn (Su):</strong> Any humanoid slain by a spectre becomes
      a spectre in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the spectre that created them and remain enslaved until
      its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="spectre--combat--unnatural-aura-su">Unnatural Aura (Su):</strong> Animals, whether wild or
      domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a spectre at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly
      approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that
      range.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="spectre--combat--sunlight-powerlessness-ex">Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex):</strong> Spectres are
      powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a <i>daylight</i> spell) and flee from it. A spectre caught in sunlight
      cannot attack and can take only a single move or attack action in a round.

    <h2 id="sphinx">Sphinx</h2>
    <p>
      Sphinxes are enigmatic creatures with great, feathery wings and leonine bodies. All sphinxes are territorial, but
      the more intelligent ones can differentiate between deliberate intrusion and temporary or inadvertent trespass.
    </p>
    <p>A typical sphinx is about 10 feet long and weighs about 800 pounds.</p>
    <p>Sphinxes speak Sphinx, Common, and Draconic.</p>
    <h3 id="sphinx--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Most sphinxes fight on the ground, using their wings to help them pounce much as lions do. If outnumbered by
      earthbound creatures, a sphinx takes wing and attacks on the fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="sphinx--combat--pounce-ex">Pounce (Ex):</strong> If a sphinx charges a foe, it can make a full attack,
      including two rake attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="sphinx--combat--rake-ex">Rake (Ex):</strong> A sphinx that pounces onto a creature can make two rake

    <h4 id="sphinx--androsphinx--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      In battle, an androsphinx rips apart enemies with its razor-sharp claws. It relies on its natural weapons in a
      fight, employing its spells for defense or healing.
    </p>
    <p><strong id="sphinx--androsphinx--combat--rake-ex">Rake (Ex):</strong> Attack bonus +18 melee, damage 2d4+3.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="sphinx--androsphinx--combat--roar-su">Roar (Su):</strong> Three times per day an androsphinx can loose
      a mighty roar. The first time it does this, all creatures within 500 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be
      affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell for 2d6 rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the sphinx roars a second time during the same encounter, all creatures within 250 feet must succeed on a DC 19
      Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds, and all those within 90 feet are deafened for 2d6 rounds (no save).
      If it roars a third time during the same encounter, all those within 250 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude
      save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage for 2d4 rounds. In addition, any Medium or smaller creature within 90
      feet must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be thrown to the ground and take 2d8 points of damage. The force of
      this roar is so great that it deals 50 points of damage to any stone or crystalline object within 90 feet. Magic
      items and held or carried items can avoid damage with a DC 19 Reflex save. Other androsphinxes are immune to these
      effects. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

      A spider eater is about 10 feet long and 4 feet high, and has a wingspan of about 20 feet. It weighs about 4,000
      pounds.

    <h3 id="spider-eater--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A spider eater attacks with its venomous sting and powerful mandibles. Its usual tactic is to deliver a sting,
      then back off, hovering out of reach until the venom takes effect.

    <p>A spider eater requires training before it can bear a rider in combat.</p>
    <p>
      Training a spider eater requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a spider eater requires
      an exotic saddle. A spider eater can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or
      she succeeds on a Ride check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spider eater eggs are worth 2,000 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp each. Professional
      trainers charge 3,000 gp to rear or train a spider eater.

      Most nixies are slim and comely, with lightly scaled, pale green skin and dark green hair. Females often twine
      shells and pearl strings in their hair and dress in wraps woven from colorful seaweed. Males wear loincloths of
      the same materials. Nixies prefer not to leave their lakes.

      A stirge’s coloration ranges from rust-red to reddish-brown, with a dirty yellow underside. The proboscis is pink
      at the tip, fading to gray at its base.
    </p>
    <p>A stirge’s body is about 1 foot long, with a wingspan of about 2 feet. It weighs about 1 pound.</p>
    <h3 id="stirge--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A stirge attacks by landing on a victim, finding a vulnerable spot, and plunging its proboscis into the flesh.
      This is a touch attack and can target only Small or larger creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="stirge--combat--attach-ex">Attach (Ex):</strong> If a stirge hits with a touch attack, it uses its
      eight pincers to latch onto the opponent’s body. An attached stirge is effectively grappling its prey. The stirge
      loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 12, but holds on with great tenacity. Stirges have a +12 racial
      bonus on grapple checks (already figured into the Base Attack/Grapple entry above).
    </p>
    <p>
      An attached stirge can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself. To remove an attached stirge through grappling,
      the opponent must achieve a pin against the stirge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="stirge--combat--blood-drain-ex">Blood Drain (Ex):</strong> A stirge drains blood, dealing 1d4 points
      of Constitution damage in any round when it begins its turn attached to a victim. Once it has dealt 4 points of
      Constitution damage, it detaches and flies off to digest the meal. If its victim dies before the stirge’s appetite
      has been sated, the stirge detaches and seeks a new target.
    </p>
    <h2 id="swarm">Swarm</h2>
    <p>
      Swarms are dense masses of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that would not be particularly dangerous in small
      groups, but can be terrible foes when gathered in sufficient numbers. For game purposes a swarm is defined as a
      single creature with a space of 10 feet—gigantic hordes are actually composed of dozens of swarms in close
      proximity. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and
      a single Armor Class. It makes saving throws as a single creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many different creatures can mass as swarms; bat swarms, centipede swarms, hellwasp swarms, locust swarms, rat
      swarms, and spider swarms are described here. The swarm’s type varies with the nature of the component creature
      (most are animals or vermin), but all swarms have the swarm subtype.
    </p>
    <p>
      A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive
      creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures consists of
      10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than
      could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed
      tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are
      represented by multiples of single swarms. A large swarm is completely shapeable, though it usually remains
      contiguous.
    </p>
    <h3 id="swarm--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      In order to attack, a single swarm moves into opponents’ spaces, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can
      occupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey, but remains a creature with a
      10-foot space. Swarms never make attacks of opportunity, but they can provoke attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike other creatures with a 10-foot space, a swarm is shapeable. It can occupy any four contiguous squares, and
      it can squeeze through any space large enough to contain one of its component creatures.
    </p>
    <h4 id="swarm--combat--vulnerabilities-of-swarms">Vulnerabilities of Swarms</h4>
    <p>
      Swarms are extremely difficult to fight with physical attacks. However, they have a few special vulnerabilities,
      as follows:
    </p>
    <p>A lit torch swung as an improvised weapon deals 1d3 points of fire damage per hit.</p>
    <p>
      A weapon with a special ability such as flaming or frost deals its full energy damage with each hit, even if the
      weapon’s normal damage can’t affect the swarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lit lantern can be used as a thrown weapon, dealing 1d4 points of fire damage to all creatures in squares
      adjacent to where it breaks.

      A single hellwasp resembles a thumb-sized normal wasp, except its carapace is gleaming black with ruby-red
      stripes, and its compound eyes are an iridescent green. In swarms, hellwasps form a collective hive mind
      intelligence with infernal cunning and bloodlust.
    </p>
    <h4 id="swarm--hellwasp-swarm--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Like any swarm, a hellwasp swarm seeks to surround and attack any living prey it encounters. A swarm deals 3d6
      points of damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move. The swarm can take over the
      bodies of its prey and infest both the living and the dead, using them as horrible living (or unliving) puppets to
      accomplish acts of wickedness that a swarm of insects could never attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hellwasp swarm’s attack is treated as an evil-aligned weapon and a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming
      damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="swarm--hellwasp-swarm--combat--distraction-ex">Distraction (Ex):</strong> Any living creature that
      begins its turn with a hellwasp swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1
      round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="swarm--hellwasp-swarm--combat--inhabit-ex">Inhabit (Ex):</strong> A hellwasp swarm can enter the body
      of a helpless or dead creature by crawling into its mouth and other orifices. Inhabiting requires 1 minute, and
      the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large (although four swarms working together can inhabit a Huge creature).
      The swarm can abandon the body at any time, although doing this takes 1 full round. Any attack against the host
      deals half damage to the hellwasp swarm as well, although the swarm’s resistances and immunities may negate some
      or all of this damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it can restore animation to the creature and control its movements,
      effectively transforming it into a zombie of the appropriate size for as long as the swarm remains inside. If a
      hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can neutralize the effects of its own poison and control the victim’s
      movement and actions as if using <i>dominate monster</i> on the victim. The hellwasps quickly consume a living
      victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution damage per hour they inhabit a body. A body reduced to Constitution 0
      is dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hellwasp-inhabited creature is relatively easy to spot, since its skin crawls with the forms of insects inside.
      The swarm is intelligent enough to attempt to hide beneath loose clothing or a large cloak to keep its presence
      from being detected. The swarm can attempt a Disguise check to conceal its inhabitation of a host, with a –4
      penalty if currently inhabiting a Small host.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i> spell cast on an inhabited victim forces the hellwasp swarm to abandon its
      host.
