    <h1>MONSTERS AS RACES</h1>
    <p>
      While every monsterhas the statistics that a player would need to play the creature as a character, most monsters
      are not suitable as PCs. Creatures who have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower, who have no way to communicate,
      or who are so different from other PCs that they disrupt the campaign should not be used. Some creatures have
      strange innate abilities or great physical power, and thus are questionable at best as characters (except in
      high-level campaigns).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Starting Level of a Monster PC:</strong> Monsters suitable for play have a level adjustment given in their
      statistics. Add a monster’s level adjustment to its Hit Dice and class levels to get the creature’s effective
      character level, or ECL. Effectively, monsters with a level adjustment become multiclass character when they take
      class levels. A creature’s “monster class” is always a favored class, and the creature never takes XP penalties
      for having it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Humanoids and Class Levels:</strong> Creatures with 1 or less HD replace their monster levels with their
      character levels. The monster loses the attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skills, and feats granted by its 1
      monster HD and gains the attack bonus, save bonuses, skills, feats, and other class abilities of a 1st-level
      character of the appropriate class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters with more than 1 Hit Die because of their race do not get a feat for their first class level as members
      of the common races do, and they do not multiply the skill points for their first class level by four. Instead,
      they have already received a feat for their first Hit Die because of race, and they have already multiplied their
      racial skill points for their first Hit Die by four.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Level Adjustment and Effective Character Level:</strong> To determine the effective character level (ECL)
      of a monster character, add its level adjustment to its racial Hit Dice and character class levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use ECL instead of character levelto determine how many experience points a monster character needs to reach its
      next level. Also use ECL to determine starting wealth for a monster character.
    </p>
    <p>Monster characters treat skills mentioned in their monster entry as class skills.</p>
    <p>
      If a monster has 1 Hit Die or less, or if it is a template creature, it must start the game with one or more class
      levels, like a regular character. If a monster has 2 or more Hit Dice, it can start with no class levels (though
      it can gain them later).
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if the creature is of a kind that normally advances by Hit Dice rather than class levels a PC can gain class
      levels rather than Hit Dice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hit Dice:</strong> The creature’s Hit Dice equal the number of class levels it has plus its racial Hit
      Dice. Additional Hit Dice gained from taking levels in a character class never affect a creature’s size like
      additional racial Hit Dice do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Feat Acquisition and Ability Score Increases:</strong> A monster’s total Hit Dice, not its ECL, govern its
      acquisition of feats and ability score increases.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Scores for Monster PCs:</strong> While a monsters statistics give the ability scores for a typical
      creature of a certain kind, any “monster” creature that becomes an adventurer is definitely not typical.
      Therefore, when creating a PC from a creature, check to see if the creature’s entry has any ability scores of 10
      or higher. If so, for each score, subtract 10 (if the score is even) or 11 (if the score is odd) to get the
      creature’s modifier for that ability based on its race or kind. Generate the character’s ability scores as normal,
      then add the racial ability modifiers to get their ability scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Some monsters have base ability scores other than 10 and 11. If alternate scores were used
      this will be indicated in the monster entry. Also, some monsters that make good PCs have their racial ability
      modifiers and other traits already listed in their monster entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ability scores lower than 10, the procedure is different. First, determine the character’s ability scores, and
      compare that number to the monster’s average ability score, using either the table below that applies to
      Intelligence or the table that applies to the other five ability scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      The separate table for Intelligence ensures that no PC ends up with an Intelligence score lower than 3. This is
      important, because creatures with an Intelligence score lower than 3 are not playable characters. Creatures with
      any ability score lower than 1 are also not playable.

      <strong>Other Statistics for Monsters:</strong> Creatures with Hit Dice of 1 or less have normal, class-based Hit
      Dice and features. They get skills and feats appropriate to a 1st-level character (even if they have a level

    <p>
      A monster with Hit Dice of 1 or less, a level adjustment, and class levels adds its class levels, Hit Die, and
      level adjustment together when determining experience needed (class level + HD + level adjustment).

      A monster with more than one Hit Die, a level adjustment, and class levels adds its Hit Dice, class levels, and
