    <h1>MONSTERS (H-I)</h1>

    <h2 id="hag">Hag</h2>
    <p>
      Although different hags are unique in appearance and mannerism, they have many aspects in common. All take the
      form of crones whose bent shapes belie their fierce power and swiftness.
    </p>
    <p>Hags speak Giant and Common.</p>
    <h3 id="hag--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Hags are tremendously strong. They are naturally resistant to spells and can cast magic of their own. Hags often
      gather to form coveys. A covey, usually containing one hag of each type, can use powers beyond those of the
      individual members.

      An annis commonly uses its <i>disguise self</i> ability to take the form of an exceptionally tall human, a fair
      giant, or an ogre.

      Though physically powerful, these hags do not favor simple assaults but try to divide and confuse their foes

      this is not always the case.
    </p>
    <h4 id="hag--hag-covey--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>Hags in a covey rely on deception and their boosted magical abilities in combat.</p>
    <p>
      A covey of hags is 80% likely to be guarded by 1d8 ogres and 1d4 evil giants who do their bidding. These minions
      are often disguised with a
      <i>veil</i> spell to appear less threatening and sent forth as spies. Such minions often (60%) carry magic stones
      known as <i>hag eyes</i> (see below).

      participate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once per month, a covey that does not have a <i>hag eye</i> can create one from a gem worth at least 20 gp (see
      below).
    </p>
    <h4 id="hag--hag-covey--hag-eye">Hag Eye</h4>
    <p>
      A <i>hag eye</i> is a magic gem created by a covey. It appears to be nothing more than a semiprecious stone, but a
      <i>gem of seeing</i> or other such effect reveals it as a disembodied eye. Often, a <i>hag eye</i> is worn as a
      ring, brooch, or other adornment. Any of the three hags who created the <i>hag eye</i> can see through it whenever
      they wish, so long as it is on the same plane of existence as the hag. A <i>hag eye</i> has hardness 5 and 10 hit
      points. Destroying a <i>hag eye</i> deals 1d10 points of damage to each member of the covey and causes the one who
      sustained the greatest damage to be blinded for 24 hours.

      Halflings stand about 3 feet tall and usually weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. They have brown or black eyes.
      Halfling men often have long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches almost unseen. Halflings
      prefer simple, comfortable, and practical clothes. Unlike members of most races, they prefer actual comfort to
      shows of wealth. Halflings reach adulthood in their early twenties and generally live into the middle of their
      second century. Halflings speak Halfling and Common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most halflings encountered outside their home are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of
      1st level.
    </p>
    <h3 id="halfling--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Halflings prefer to fight defensively, usually hiding and launching ranged attacks as the foe approaches. Their
      tactics are very much like those of elves but place more emphasis on cover and concealment and less on mobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="halfling--combat--halfling-traits-ex">Halfling Traits (Ex):</strong> Halflings possess the following
      racial traits.
    </p>
    <p>— +2 Dexterity, –2 Strength.</p>
    <p>
      —Small size. +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls, +4 bonus on Hide checks, –4 penalty on grapple
      checks, lifting and carrying limits 3/4 those of Medium characters.
    </p>
    <p>—A halfling’s base land speed is 20 feet.</p>
    <p>— +2 racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and Move Silently checks.</p>
    <p>— +1 racial bonus on all saving throws.</p>
    <p>
      — +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. This bonus stacks with the halfling’s +1 bonus on saving throws
      in general.
    </p>
    <p>— +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with thrown weapons and slings.</p>
    <p>— +2 racial bonus on Listen checks.</p>
    <p>—Automatic Languages: Common, Halfling. Bonus Languages: Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Goblin, Orc.</p>

    </p>
    <h3 id="halfling--subraces">Subraces</h3>
    <p>
      The information above is for the lightfoot halfling, the most common halfling variety. There are two other major
      halfling subraces, which differ from lightfoot halflings as follows.
    </p>
    <h4 id="halfling--subraces--tallfellow">Tallfellow</h4>
    <p>
      Tallfellows are somewhat rare among halfling folk. Tallfellows are 4 feet tall or more and weigh between 30 and 35
      pounds. They generally speak Elven in addition to Common and Halfling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="halfling--subraces--tallfellow--tallfellow-traits-ex">Tallfellow Traits (Ex):</strong> These traits
      are in addition to the lightfoot halfling traits, except where noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      — +2 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks. Like an elf, a tallfellow who merely passes within 5 feet of
      a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check as though actively looking for it. This trait replaces
      the lightfoot’s +2 bonus on Listen checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Tallfellows are less athletic than lightfoot halflings and do not have a racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and Move
      Silently checks.
    </p>
    <h4 id="halfling--subraces--deep-halfling">Deep Halfling</h4>
    <p>These halflings are shorter and stockier than the more common lightfeet.</p>
    <p>
      Deep halflings are about 2-1/2 tall and weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. Deep halflings speak Dwarven fluently.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="halfling--subraces--deep-halfling--deep-halfling-traits-ex">Deep Halfling Traits (Ex):</strong> These
      traits are in addition to the lightfoot halfling traits, except where noted.
    </p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>
      —Stonecunning: Like dwarves, deep halflings have a +2 racial bonus on checks to notice unusual stonework.
      Something that isn’t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A deep halfling who
      merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a check as though actively searching and can use the
      Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A deep halfling can also intuit depth, sensing the
      approximate distance underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.
    </p>
    <p>— +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks and Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.</p>
    <p>
      —Deep halflings are less athletic than lightfoot halflings and do not have a racial bonus on Climb, Jump, and Move
      Silently checks.

      Harpies like to entrance hapless travelers with their magical songs and lead them to unspeakable torments. Only
      when a harpy has finished playing with its new “toys” will it release them from suffering by killing and consuming
      them.
    </p>
    <h3 id="harpy--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>When a harpy engages in battle, it prefers to use Flyby Attack and strike with a melee weapon.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="harpy--combat--captivating-song-su">Captivating Song (Su):</strong> The most insidious ability of the
      harpy is its song. When a harpy sings, all creatures (other than harpies) within a 300-foot spread must succeed on
      a DC 16 Will save or become captivated. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. A creature that successfully
      saves cannot be affected again by the same harpy’s song for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      A captivated victim walks toward the harpy, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a
      dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, or the like), that creature gets a second saving throw. Captivated
      creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. (Thus, a fighter cannot run away or attack but
      takes no defensive penalties.) A victim within 5 feet of the harpy stands there and offers no resistance to the
      monster’s attacks. The effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round thereafter. A bard’s
      countersong ability allows the captivated creature to attempt a new Will save.

      A cruel hunter and roaming brigand, the harpy archer has trained as a fighter specializing in ranged combat. Harpy

      Hippogriffs are aggressive flying creatures that combine features of horses and giant eagles. Voracious omnivores,
      hippogriffs will hunt humanoids as readily as any other meal. A typical hippogriff is 9 feet long, has a wingspan
      of 20 feet, and weighs 1,000 pounds.
    </p>
    <h3 id="hippogriff--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Hippogriffs dive at their prey and strike with their clawed forelegs. When they cannot dive, they slash with claws
      and beak. Mated pairs and flights of these creatures attack in concert, diving repeatedly to drive away or kill
      intruders. Hippogriffs fight to the death to defend their nests and their hatchlings, which are prized as aerial
      mounts and fetch a handsome price in many civilized areas.

    <h3 id="hippogriff--training-a-hippogriff">Training a Hippogriff</h3>
    <p>A hippogriff requires training before it can bear a rider in combat.</p>
    <p>
      Training a hippogriff requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a hippogriff requires an
      exotic saddle. A hippogriff can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she
      succeeds on a Ride check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippogriff eggs are worth 2,000 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp each. Professional
      trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a hippogriff.

      A homunculus is a miniature servant created by a wizard. These creatures are weak combatants but make effective
      spies, messengers, and scouts. A homunculus’s creator determines its precise features. Homunculi are little more
      than tools designed to carry out assigned tasks. They are extensions of their creators, sharing the same alignment
      and basic nature. A homunculus cannot speak, but the process of creating one links it telepathically with its
      creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      It knows what its master knows and can convey to him or her everything it sees and hears, out to a distance of
      1,500 feet. A homunculus never travels beyond this range willingly, though it can be removed forcibly. If this
      occurs, the creature does everything in its power to regain contact with its master. An attack that destroys a
      homunculus deals 2d10 points of damage to its master.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the creature’s master is slain, the homunculus also dies, and its body swiftly melts away into a pool of ichor.

      A homunculus is shaped from a mixture of clay, ashes, mandrake root, spring water, and one pint of the creator’s
      own blood. The materials cost 50 gp. The creature’s master may assemble the body or hire someone else to do the
      job. Creating the body requires a DC 12 Craft (sculpting) check or a DC 12 Craft (pottery) check.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the body is sculpted, it is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared
      laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist’s laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is
      personally constructing the creature’s body, the building and ritual can be performed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      A homunculus with more than 2 Hit Dice can be created, but each additional Hit Die adds +2,000 gp to the cost to
      create.
    </p>
    <p>
      Craft Construct, <i>arcane eye, mirror image, mending,</i> caster must be at least 4th level; Price — (never
      sold); Cost 1,050 gp + 78 XP.

    <p>
      Howlers live on planes where chaos and evil hold sway. A howler is about 8 feet long and weighs about 2,000
      pounds. Although they are surprisingly intelligent, howlers do not speak—they only howl. If there is a language
      within the howls, as some have suggested, even spells cannot decipher it. Howlers understand Abyssal.
    </p>
    <h3 id="howler--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Howlers attack in groups, for they are cowardly and cruel. They prefer to charge into combat, race out, and then
      charge in again. A howler’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and
      evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="howler--combat--quills-ex">Quills (Ex):</strong> A howler’s neck bristles with long quills. While
      biting, the creature thrashes about, striking with 1d4 of them. An opponent hit by a howler’s quill attack must
      succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or have the quill break off in his or her flesh. Lodged quills impose a –1 penalty
      on attacks, saves, and checks per quill. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quill can be removed safely with a DC 20 Heal check; otherwise, removing a quill deals an extra 1d6 points of
      damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="howler--combat--howl-ex">Howl (Ex):</strong> All beings other than outsiders that hear the creature’s
      howling for an hour or longer are subject to its effect, though it does not help the howler in combat. Anyone
      within hearing range of a howler for a full hour must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or take 1 point of Wisdom
      damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. The save must be repeated for each hour of exposure. This is a sonic
      mind-affecting effect.
    </p>
    <h3 id="howler--training-a-howler">Training a Howler</h3>
    <p>
      Although intelligent, a howler requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a howler
      must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check).
      Training a friendly howler requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a howler requires an
      exotic saddle. A howler can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she
      succeeds on a Ride check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="howler--training-a-howler--carrying-capacity">Carrying Capacity:</strong> A light load for a howler is
      up to 460 pounds; a medium load, 461–920 pounds; and a heavy load, 921–1,380 pounds. A howler can drag 6,900
      pounds.

    <p>
      Hydras are reptile-like monsters with multiple heads. A hydra is gray-brown to dark brown, with a light yellow or
      tan underbelly. The eyes are amber and the teeth are yellow-white. It is about 20 feet long and weighs about 4,000
      pounds. Hydras do not speak.
    </p>
    <h3 id="hydra--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>Hydras can attack with all their heads at no penalty, even if they move or charge during the round.</p>
    <p>
      A hydra can be killed either by severing all its heads or by slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent must
      make a successful sunder attempt with a slashing weapon. (The player should declare where the attack is aimed
      before making the attack roll.) Making a sunder attempt provokes an attack of opportunity unless the foe has the
      Improved Sunder feat. An opponent can strike at a hydra’s heads from any position in which he could strike at the
      hydra itself, because the hydra’s head writhe and whip about in combat. An opponent can ready an action to attempt
      to sunder a hydra’s head when the creature bites at him. Each of a hydra’s heads has hit points equal to the
      creature’s full normal hit point total, divided by its original number of heads. Losing a head deals damage to the
      body equal to half the head’s full normal hit points. A natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further
      blood loss. A hydra can no longer attack with a severed head but takes no other penalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time a head is severed, two new heads spring from the stump in 1d4 rounds. A hydra can never have more than
      twice its original number of heads at any one time, and any extra heads it gains beyond its original number wither
      and die within a day. To prevent a severed head from growing back into two heads, at least 5 points of fire or
      acid damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before the new heads appear. A flaming weapon (or
      similar effect) deals its energy damage to the stump in the same blow in which a head is severed. Fire or acid
      damage from an area effect may burn multiple stumps in addition to dealing damage to the hydra’s body. A hydra
      does not die from losing its heads until all its heads have been cut off and the stumps seared by fire or acid.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hydra’s body can be slain just like any other creature’s, but hydras possess fast healing (see below) and are
      difficult to defeat in this fashion. Any attack that is not (or cannot be) an attempt to sunder a head affects the
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Targeted magical effects cannot sever a hydra’s heads (and thus must be directed at the body) unless they deal
      slashing damage and could be used to make sunder attempts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="hydra--combat--fast-healing-ex">Fast Healing (Ex):</strong> Each round, a hydra heals damage equal to

      provided it swims in a straight line.

      These reddish hydras can breathe jets of fire 10 feet high, 10 feet wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once

    <h2 id="inevitable">Inevitable</h2>
    <p>Inevitables are constructs whose sole aim is to enforce the natural laws of the universe.</p>
    <p>
      Each type of inevitable is designed to find and punish a particular kind of transgression, hunting down a person
      or group that has violated a fundamental principle. When an inevitable is created, it receives its first mission,
      then finds the transgressors and metes out appropriate punishment. The sentence is usually death, although some
      inevitables insist on compensation to the wronged party instead, using <i>geas</i> and <i>mark of justice</i> to
      ensure compliance. From its first step, an inevitable focuses totally on its target. It continues its efforts no
      matter how cold the trail or hopeless the task. Inevitables are single-minded in pursuit of their quarry, but they
      are under orders to leave innocents alone. Accomplices to their prey are fair game, however, which sometimes
      creates conflicts within their programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inevitables gladly sacrifice themselves to complete a mission, but they aren’t suicidal. Faced with impending
      defeat, they are likely to withdraw and seek a way to even the odds. They are determined but patient foes. They
      ally with others if that helps accomplish their mission, but they have a hard time keeping allies for long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inevitables tend to stick out in a crowd while they’re in observation mode, but they seem oblivious to the
      attention. Their forms vary, but all inevitables are gold-and-silver clockwork creatures, with gears and pistons
      where muscles would be on flesh-and-blood creatures. Their eyes glow with a golden radiance.
    </p>
    <p>Note that unlike most constructs, inevitables have an Intelligence score and can think, learn, and remember.</p>
    <p>Inevitables speak Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and the native language of their first target.</p>
    <h3 id="inevitable--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Unless their very existence is threatened, inevitables focus completely on the transgressor they’ve been assigned
      to, ignoring other combatants completely. An inevitable might attack anyone who hinders its progress, but it won’t
      tarry beyond the point where it can reengage its quarry. Inevitables take self-defense very seriously; anyone who
      attacks an inevitable with what the creature perceives as deadly force is met with deadly force in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inevitable’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose
      of overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="inevitable--combat--fast-healing-ex">Fast Healing (Ex):</strong> An inevitable heals a certain amount
      of damage each round (specified in each variety’s description) as long as it has at least 1 hit point. However,
      damage dealt by chaotic weapons heals at the normal rate.

    <p>Kolyaruts mete out punishment to those who break bargains and oaths.</p>
    <p>
      Before beginning a mission against a deal-breaker, a kolyarut learns as much about the contract or oath as
      possible. It’s not interested in those who break deals accidentally or against their will— only those who
      willingly break contracts violate the principle that kolyaruts are created to uphold. If a written contract was
      broken, the kolyarut typically carries a copy of the contract with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kolyaruts are the most talkative of the inevitables, making credible attempts at social niceties such as proper
      greetings before getting down to the matter at hand. They can use <i>disguise self</i> to appear as almost any
      kind of humanoid—useful if they need to go undercover to catch their quarry.
    </p>
    <h4 id="inevitable--kolyarut--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Like all inevitables, a kolyarut is patient enough to study a target before striking. It has a good idea of the
      deal-breaker’s abilities and defenses before it enters battle. When it fights, it tries to get the conflict over
      as soon as possible, minimizing excess bloodshed and mayhem. It doesn’t let concern for innocents delay or
      endanger its mission, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      A kolyarut’s favorite tactic is to use <i>invisibility</i> or <i>disguise self</i> to sneak close, then eliminate
      the quarry with its vampiric touch ability before it can react. A kolyarut has no compunctions about using its
      vampiric touch ability on allies to increase its own power, if doing so helps it complete its mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      A kolyarut’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of
      overcoming damage reduction.

    <p>Maruts confront those who would try to deny the grave itself.</p>
    <p>
      Any who use unnatural means to extend their life span could be targeted by a marut. Those who take extraordinary
      measures to cheat death in some other way might be labeled transgressors as well. Those who use magic to reverse
      death aren’t worthy of a marut’s attention unless they do so repeatedly or on a massive scale.
    </p>
    <p>When a marut has identified its target, it walks surely and implacably toward the foe, never resting.</p>
    <h4 id="inevitable--marut--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Once it has found its target, a marut brings it the death it has been trying to avoid. Those who defile death
      through necromancy may instead receive a <i>geas</i> and/or <i>mark of justice</i> to enforce proper respect. It
      typically uses <i>wall of force</i> to shut off any escape routes, then opens up with <i>chain lightning</i> while
      it closes to melee range. Once there, it strikes with its massive fists, using <i>circle of death</i> if beset by
      numbers of defenders. It hits spellcasting opponents with repeated uses of <i>greater dispel magic,</i> and it
      uses <i>dimension door</i> and <i>locate creature</i> to track down foes who flee.
    </p>
    <p>
      A marut’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of
      overcoming damage reduction.

      <strong id="inevitable--marut--combat--fists-of-thunder-and-lightning-su"
        >Fists of Thunder and Lightning (Su):</strong
      >
      A marut’s left fist delivers a loud thunderclap whenever it hits something, dealing an extra 3d6 points of sonic
      damage and causing the target to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 31 negates the deafness). Its right fist
      delivers a shock for an extra 3d6 points of electricity damage, and the flash of lightning causes the target to be
      blinded for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 31 negates the blindness). The save DCs are Strength-based and include the
      marut’s Ability Focus feat.

      Zelekhuts are charged with hunting down those who would deny justice—especially those who flee to escape
      punishment. Expert trackers, they use a combination of natural skill and magic to find fugitives wherever they may
      hide.
    </p>
    <p>
      A zelekhut may initially appear rather non-threatening—but when it is about to enter combat, it can cause two
      spiked chains to spring forth from its forearms as a free action. In similar fashion, it can cause a pair of
      golden metallic wings to emerge from its back. Retracting the chains or the wings is also a free action.
    </p>
    <h4 id="inevitable--zelekhut--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Once it has found its fugitive, a zelekhut uses its speed and its spell-like abilities to cover the most likely
      escape routes. Then it immobilizes any defenders while attempting to protect any innocent bystanders. Finally, it
      apprehends the fugitive with its spiked chains, tripping or disarming the foe as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A zelekhut’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of
      overcoming damage reduction.

      Invisible stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Air. They sometimes serve wizards and sorcerers,
      who summon them to perform specific tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A summoned invisible stalker undertakes whatever task the summoner commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or
      thousands of miles away. The creature follows a command until the task is completed and obeys only the summoner.
      However, it resents protracted missions or complex tasks and seeks to pervert its instructions accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A <i>see invisibility</i> spell shows only a dim outline of a cloud,
      while a <i>true seeing</i> spell reveals a roiling cloud of vapor.
    </p>
    <p>These creatures speak only Auran but can understand Common.</p>
    <h3 id="invisible-stalker--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      An invisible stalker attacks by using the air itself as a weapon. It creates a sudden, intense blast of wind that
      pounds a single target on the same plane as the creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      An invisible stalker can be killed only when it is on the Elemental Plane of Air. When performing a task
      elsewhere, it automatically returns to its home plane when it takes damage sufficient to destroy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="invisible-stalker--combat--natural-invisibility-su">Natural Invisibility (Su):</strong> This ability
      is constant, allowing a stalker to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject
      to the <i>invisibility purge</i> spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="invisible-stalker--combat--improved-tracking-ex">Improved Tracking (Ex):</strong> An invisible stalker
      is a consummate tracker and makes Spot checks instead of the usual Survival checks to trace a creature’s passage.
