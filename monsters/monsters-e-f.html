      A typical giant eagle stands about 10 feet tall, has a wingspan of up to 20 feet, and resembles its smaller
      cousins in nearly every way except size. It weighs about 500 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>Giant eagles speak Common and Auran.</p>
    <h3 id="eagle-giant--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A giant eagle typically attacks from a great height, diving earthward at tremendous speed. When it cannot dive, it
      uses its powerful talons and slashing beak to strike at its target’s head and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A solitary giant eagle is typically hunting or patrolling in the vicinity of its nest and generally ignores
      creatures that do not appear threatening. A mated pair attacks in concert, making repeated diving attacks to drive
      away intruders, and fights to the death to defend their nest or hatchlings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="eagle-giant--combat--evasion-ex">Evasion (Ex):</strong> With a successful Reflex save against an
      attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, a giant eagle takes no damage.
    </p>
    <p><strong id="eagle-giant--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> Giant eagles have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>
    <h3 id="eagle-giant--training-a-giant-eagle">Training a Giant Eagle</h3>
    <p>
      Although intelligent, a giant eagle requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a giant
      eagle must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy
      check). Training a friendly giant eagle requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riding a giant eagle requires an exotic saddle. A giant eagle can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider
      cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giant eagle eggs are worth 2,500 gp apiece on the open market, while chicks are worth 4,000 gp each. Professional
      trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a giant eagle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrying Capacity: A light load for a giant eagle is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy
      load, 601–900 pounds.

      enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or
      enters the whirlwind, or if the elemental moves into or through the creature’s space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage when caught in the whirlwind
      (see the table below for details) and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex
      save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take the indicated damage. It must also succeed on a second
      Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking the indicated
      damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The
      creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the whirlwind’s
      effects varies with the elemental’s size (see the table). The save DC is Strength based.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the elemental carries them or to escape the
      whirlwind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 +
      spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a –4 penalty to Dexterity and a –2 penalty on
      attack rolls. The elemental can have only as many creatures trapped inside the whirlwind at one time as will fit
      inside the whirlwind’s volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens
      to be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the whirlwind’s base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the
      elemental and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including
      darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total
      concealment.
    </p>
    <p>Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.</p>
    <p>An elemental in whirlwind form cannot make slam attacks and does not threaten the area around it.</p>

    <p>
      When summoned to the Material Plane, an earth elemental consists of whatever types of dirt, stones, precious
      metals, and gems it was conjured from.
    </p>
    <p>Earth elementals speak Terran but rarely choose to do so.</p>
    <h4 id="elemental--earth-elemental--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Though an earth elemental moves slowly, it is a relentless opponent. It can travel though solid ground or stone as
      easily as humans walk on the earth’s surface. It cannot swim, however, and must either walk around a body of water
      or go through the ground under it. An earth elemental can move along the bottom of a body of water but prefers not
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="elemental--earth-elemental--combat--earth-mastery-ex">Earth Mastery (Ex):</strong> An earth elemental
      gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is
      airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a –4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not
      included in the statistics block.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="elemental--earth-elemental--combat--push-ex">Push (Ex):</strong> An earth elemental can start a bull
      rush maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity. The combat modifiers given in Earth Mastery, above, also
      apply to the elemental’s opposed Strength checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="elemental--earth-elemental--combat--earth-glide-ex">Earth Glide (Ex):</strong> An earth elemental can
      glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water.
      Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A
      <i>move earth</i> spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet,
      stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.

      A fire elemental cannot enter water or any other nonflammable liquid. A body of water is an impassible barrier
      unless the fire elemental can step or jump over it.
    </p>
    <p>Fire elementals speak Ignan, though they rarely choose to do so.</p>
    <h4 id="elemental--fire-elemental--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      A fire elemental is a fierce opponent that attacks its enemies directly and savagely. It takes joy in burning the
      creatures and objects of the Material Plane to ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="elemental--fire-elemental--combat--burn-ex">Burn (Ex):</strong> A fire elemental’s slam attack deals
      bludgeoning damage plus fire damage from the elemental’s flaming body. Those hit by a fire elemental‘s slam attack
      also must succeed on a Reflex save or catch on fire. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds. The save DC varies with the
      elemental’s size (see the table below). A burning creature can take a move action to put out the flame. The save
      DC is Constitution- based.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures hitting a fire elemental with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take fire damage as though hit by the
      elemental’s attack, and also catch on fire unless they succeed on a Reflex save.

    <p>A water elemental can’t venture more than 180 feet from the body of water from which it was conjured.</p>
    <p>Water elementals speak Aquan but rarely choose to do so.</p>
    <h4 id="elemental--water-elemental--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      A water elemental prefers to fight in a large body of water where it can disappear beneath the waves and suddenly
      swell up behind its opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="elemental--water-elemental--combat--water-mastery-ex">Water Mastery (Ex):</strong> A water elemental
      gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the
      elemental is touching the ground, the elemental takes a –4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers
      are not included in the statistics block.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A water elemental can be a serious threat to a ship that crosses its path. An elemental can easily overturn small
      craft (5 feet of length per Hit Die of the elemental) and stop larger vessels (10 feet long per HD). Even large
      ships (20 feet long per HD) can be slowed to half speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="elemental--water-elemental--combat--drench-ex">Drench (Ex):</strong> The elemental’s touch puts out
      torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or
      smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as <i>dispel magic</i> (caster level equals elemental’s
      HD).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="elemental--water-elemental--combat--vortex-su">Vortex (Su):</strong> The elemental can transform
      itself into a whirlpool once every 10 minutes, provided it is underwater, and remain in that form for up to 1
      round for every 2 HD it has. In vortex form, the elemental can move through the water or along the bottom at its
      swim speed. The vortex is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and 10 feet or more tall,
      depending on the elemental’s size. The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elemental’s movement while in vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental
      enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters
      the vortex, or if the elemental moves into or through the creature’s space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage when caught in the vortex (see
      the table below for details) and may be swept up by it. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it
      comes into contact with the vortex or take the indicated damage. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or
      be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful currents, automatically taking damage each round. An
      affected creature is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but
      can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the vortex’s effects varies with the elemental’s
      size. The save DC is Strength-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go where the elemental carries them or to escape the
      whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC
      10 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a –4 penalty to Dexterity and a –2
      penalty on attack rolls. The elemental can have only as many creatures trapped inside the vortex at one time as
      will fit inside the vortex’s volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the vortex happens to
      be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the vortex’s base touches the bottom, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the
      elemental and has a diameter equal to half the vortex’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including
      darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total
      concealment.
    </p>
    <p>Those caught in the cloud must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.</p>
    <p>An elemental in vortex form cannot make slam attacks and does not threaten the area around it.</p>
    <p>
      Skills: A water elemental has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a
      hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run
      action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

      Elves average 5 feet tall and typically weigh just over 100 pounds. They live on fruits and grains, though they
      occasionally hunt for fresh meat. Elves prefer colorful clothes, usually with a green-and-gray cloak that blends
      well with the colors of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>Elves speak Elven, and most also know Common and Sylvan.</p>
    <p>
      Most elves encountered outside their homes are warriors; the information presented here is for one of 1st level.
    </p>
    <h3 id="elf--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Elves are cautious warriors and take time to analyze their opponents and the location of the fight if at all
      possible, maximizing their advantage by using ambushes, snipers, and camouflage. They prefer to fire from cover
      and retreat before they are found, repeating this maneuver until all of their enemies are dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      They prefer longbows, shortbows, rapiers, and longswords. In melee, elves are graceful and deadly, using complex
      maneuvers that are beautiful to observe. Their wizards often use <i>sleep</i> spells during combat because these
      won’t affect other elves.
    </p>
    <p><strong id="elf--combat--elf-traits-ex">Elf Traits (Ex):</strong> Elves possess the following racial traits.</p>
    <p>— +2 Dexterity, –2 Constitution.</p>
    <p>—Medium size.</p>
    <p>—An elf ’s base land speed is 30 feet.</p>
    <p>
      —Immunity to <i>sleep</i> spells and effects, and a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells or

    </p>

    <p>—Low-light vision.</p>
    <p>

      shortbow, and composite shortbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      — +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or
      concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.

    </p>
    <h3 id="elf--subraces">Subraces</h3>
    <p>
      The above information describes the high elf, the most common variety. There are five other major subraces of elf,
      in addition to half-elves, who share enough elven characteristics to be included here.
    </p>
    <h4 id="elf--subraces--half-elf">Half-Elf</h4>
    <p>
      Half-elves are not truly an elf subrace, but they are often mistaken for elves. Half-elves usually inherit a good
      blend of their parents’ physical characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="elf--subraces--half-elf--half-elf-traits-ex">Half-Elf Traits (Ex):</strong> Half-elves possess the
      following racial traits.
    </p>
    <p>—Medium size.</p>
    <p>—A half-elf ’s base land speed is 30 feet.</p>
    <p>
      —Immunity to <i>sleep</i> spells and similar magical effects, and a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against
      enchantment spells or effects.
    </p>
    <p>—Low-light vision.</p>
    <p>
      — +1 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. A half-elf does not have the elf ’s ability to notice secret
      doors simply by passing near them.
    </p>
    <p>
      — +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks: Half-elves get along naturally with all people. This
      bonus may not apply in situations or settings where half-elves are viewed with distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Elven Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered an elf. Half-elves, for example, are just
      as vulnerable to special effects that affect elves as their elf ancestors are, and they can use magic items that
      are only usable by elves.
    </p>
    <p>—Automatic Languages: Common, Elven. Bonus Languages: Any (other than secret languages, such as Druidic).</p>
    <p>
      —Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multiclass half-elf takes an experience point penalty for
      multiclassing, her highest-level class does not count.
    </p>
    <h4 id="elf--subraces--aquatic-elf">Aquatic Elf</h4>
    <p>Also called sea elves, these creatures are waterbreathing cousins to land-dwelling elves.</p>
    <p>Aquatic elves fight underwater with tridents, spears, and nets.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="elf--subraces--aquatic-elf--aquatic-elf-traits-ex">Aquatic Elf Traits (Ex):</strong> These traits are

    <p>—An aquatic elf has the aquatic subtype.</p>
    <p>—An aquatic elf has a swim speed of 40 feet.</p>
    <p>
      —Gills: Aquatic elves can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of Constitution (after that, refer to the
      suffocation rules).
    </p>
    <p>
      —Superior Low-Light Vision: Aquatic elves can see four times as far as a human in starlight, moonlight,

    <p>—Favored Class: Fighter. This trait replaces the high elf ’s favored class.</p>
    <h4 id="elf--subraces--drow">Drow</h4>
    <p>Also known as dark elves, drow are a depraved and evil subterranean offshoot.</p>
    <p>
      White is the most common hair color among drow, but almost any pale shade is possible. Drow tend to be smaller and
      thinner than other sorts of elves, and their eyes are often a vivid red.
    </p>
    <p>Drow usually coat their arrows with a potent venom.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="elf--subraces--drow--poison-ex">Poison (Ex):</strong> An opponent hit by a drow’s poisoned weapon must
      succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall unconscious. After 1 minute, the subject must succeed on another DC 13
      Fortitude save or remain unconscious for 2d4 hours. A typical drow carries 1d4–1 doses of drow knockout poison.
      Drow typically coat arrows and crossbow bolts with this poison, but it can also be applied to a melee weapon. Note
      that drow have no special ability to apply poison without risking being poisoned themselves. Since this poison is
      not a magical effect, drow and other elves are susceptible to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="elf--subraces--drow--drow-traits-ex">Drow Traits (Ex):</strong> These traits are in addition to the

    <p>— +2 racial bonus on Will saves against spells and spell-like abilities.</p>

      —Spell-Like Abilities: Drow can use the following spell-like abilities once per day:
      <i>dancing lights, darkness, faerie fire.</i> Caster level equals the drow’s class levels.

      —Weapon Proficiency: A drow is automatically proficient with the hand crossbow, the rapier, and the short sword.
      This trait replaces the high elf ’s weapon proficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Automatic Languages: Common, Elven, Undercommon. Bonus Languages: Abyssal, Aquan, Draconic, Drow Sign Language,
      Gnome, Goblin. This trait replaces the high elf ’s automatic and bonus languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Light Blindness: Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or a
      <i>daylight</i> spell) blinds drow for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in
      the affected area.
    </p>
    <p>—Favored Class: Wizard (male) or cleric (female). This trait replaces the high elf ’s favored class.</p>
    <p>—Level adjustment +2.</p>
    <p>
      The drow warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con
      12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

      Challenge Rating: Drow with levels in NPC classes have a CR equal to their character level. Drow with levels in PC
      classes have a CR equal to their character level +1.
    </p>
    <h4 id="elf--subraces--gray-elf">Gray Elf</h4>
    <p>
      Taller and grander in physical appearance than others of their race, gray elves have a reputation for being aloof
      and arrogant (even by elven standards). They have either silver hair and amber eyes or pale golden hair and violet
      eyes. They prefer clothing of white, silver, yellow, or gold, with cloaks of deep blue or purple.

    <p>
      Wild elvesare barbaric and tribal. Wild elves’ hair color ranges from black to light brown, lightening to silvery

      Ethereal filchers are bizarre-looking creatures with a penchant for snatching trinkets from passersby. Their
      ability to move quickly between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane makes them spectacular pickpockets.
    </p>
    <p>Ethereal filchers do not speak.</p>
    <h3 id="ethereal-filcher--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      An ethereal filcher prowls about, using its ethereal jaunt ability to move about unseen (and often through solid
      objects). Upon locating a likely mark, it shifts to the Material Plane, attempting to catch its victim unaware.
      The creature attempts to seize an item, then retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane. It is not above
      delivering a bite to distract its target. Once it secures a trinket, it scurries back to its lair to admire its
      prize. When badly wounded, a filcher escapes rather than continuing the fight.
    </p>
    <p>Any number of simple ruses can blunt a filcher’s attack.</p>

      shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as part of any move action, and shift back again as a free
      action. It can remain on the Ethereal Plane for 1 round before returning to the Material Plane. The ability is
      otherwise identical with the <i>ethereal jaunt</i> spell (caster level 15th).

      about 200 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethereal marauders speak no known languages. Survivors of their attacks on the Material Plane claim that they emit
      an eerie, high whine that varies in pitch depending on the creature’s speed and health.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ethereal-marauder--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Once a marauder locates prey, it shifts to the Material Plane to attack, attempting to catch its victim
      flat-footed. The creature bites its victim, then retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane. When badly hurt or
      wounded, a marauder escapes to its home plane rather than continuing the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ethereal-marauder--combat--ethereal-jaunt-su">Ethereal Jaunt (Su):</strong> An ethereal marauder can
      shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a move action. The
      ability is otherwise identical with the <i>ethereal jaunt</i> spell (caster level 15th).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ethereal-marauder--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> Ethereal marauders have a +2 racial bonus on
      Listen, Move Silently, and Spot checks.

    <p>An ettercap is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.</p>
    <p>Ettercaps speak Common.</p>
    <h3 id="ettercap--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Ettercaps are not brave creatures, but their cunning traps often ensure that the enemy never draws a weapon. When
      an ettercap does engage its enemies, it attacks with its keen-edged claws and venomous bite. It usually will not
      come within melee reach of any foe that is still able to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ettercap--combat--poison-ex">Poison (Ex):</strong> Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial damage 1d6 Dex,
      secondary damage 2d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ettercap--combat--web-ex">Web (Ex):</strong> An ettercap can throw a web eight times per day. This is
      similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is
      effective against targets of up to Medium size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      An entangled creature can escape with a DC 13 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a DC 17 Strength check.
      The check DCs are Constitution-based, and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus. The web has 6 hit
      points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ettercaps can also create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to 60 feet square. They usually position these to snare
      flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Spot
      check to notice a web, or they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts
      to escape or burst the webbing receive a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while
      pulling free. Each 5-foot-square section has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ettercap can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed and can determine the exact location of any
      creature touching the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ettercap--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> Ettercaps have a +4 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking),
      Hide, and Spot checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb
      checks, even if rushed or threatened.

    <p>Ettins, or two-headed giants, are vicious and unpredictable hunters that stalk the night.</p>
    <p>
      An ettin never bathes if it can help it, which usually leaves it so grimy and dirty its skin resembles thick, gray
      hide. Adult ettins are about 13 feet tall and weigh 5,200 pounds. They live about 75 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ettins have no language of their own but speak a pidgin of Orc, Goblin, and Giant. Creatures that can speak any of
      these languages must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence check to communicate with an ettin. Check once for each bit
      of information: If the other creature speaks two of these languages, the DC is 10, and for someone who speaks all
      three, the DC is 5.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ettin--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>Though ettins aren’t very intelligent, they are cunning fighters.</p>
    <p>
      They prefer to ambush their victims rather than charge into a straight fight, but once the battle has started, an
      ettin usually fights furiously until all enemies are dead.

      fights with a morningstar or javelin in each hand. Because each of its two heads controls an arm, the ettin does
      not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.
    </p>
    <p>Skills: An ettin’s two heads give it a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Spot, and Search checks.</p>

      A formian resembles a cross between an ant and a centaur. All formians are covered in a brownish-red carapace;
      size and appearance differs for each variety.
    </p>
    <h3 id="formian--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Formians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue all they encounter. If they perceive even the slightest
      threat to their hive-city or to their queen, they attack immediately and fight to the death. Any formian also
      attacks immediately if ordered to do so by a superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="formian--combat--hive-mind-ex">Hive Mind (Ex):</strong> All formians within 50 miles of their queen
      are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a group is not
      flatfooted, none of them are. No formian in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.
    </p>
    <h3 id="formian--worker">Worker</h3>
    <p>
      While workers cannot speak, they can convey simple concepts (such as danger) by body movements. Through the hive
      mind, however, they can communicate just fine—although their intelligence still limits the concepts that they can
      grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      A worker is about 3 feet long and about 2-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 60 pounds. Its hands are
      suitable only for manual labor.
    </p>
    <h4 id="formian--worker--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>Formian workers fight only to defend their hive-cities, using their mandibled bite.</p>
    <p>
      A formian worker’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the
      purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

      <strong id="formian--worker--combat--make-whole-sp"><i>Make Whole</i> (Sp):</strong> Three workers together can
      repair an object as though using the <i>make whole</i> spell (caster level 7th). This is a fullround action for
      all three workers.
    </p>
    <h3 id="formian--warrior">Warrior</h3>
    <p>
      Warriors communicate through the hive mind to convey battle plans and make reports to their commanders. They
      cannot speak otherwise.

    <h4 id="formian--warrior--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Warriors are wicked combatants, using claws, bite, and a poisonous sting all at once. Through the hive mind, they
      attack with coordinated and extremely efficient tactics.

    <p>
      These formians communicate only telepathically and derive sustenance from the mental energies of those they
      dominate.
    </p>
    <p>A taskmaster is about the same size as a warrior.</p>
    <h4 id="formian--taskmaster--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Taskmasters rely on their dominated slaves to fight for them if at all possible. If necessary, though, they can
      defend themselves with claws and a poison sting.
    </p>

      A formian taskmaster’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the

    <h3 id="formian--myrmarch">Myrmarch</h3>
    <p>
      Myrmarchs are the elite of formian society. Much more than those beneath them, these creatures are individuals,
      with goals, desires, and creative thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      A myrmarch is about is about 7 feet long and about 5-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 1,500 pounds. Its
      claws are capable of fine manipulation, like human hands. Each myrmarch wears a bronze helm to signify its
      position (the more elaborate the helm, the more prestigious the position).
    </p>
    <p>Myrmarchs speak Formian and Common.</p>
    <h4 id="formian--myrmarch--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>Myrmarchs’ claws are like hands and thus serve no combat purpose.</p>
    <p>Myrmarchs occasionally employ javelins for ranged attacks, coated with poison from their own stingers.</p>
    <p>
      They fight intelligently, aiding those under them (if any such are present) and commanding them through the hive
      mind. If chaotic creatures are present, however, a myrmarch is singleminded in its quest to destroy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A formian myrmarch’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the

    <h3 id="formian--queen">Queen</h3>
    <p>
      The formian queen cannot move. With her telepathic abilities, though, she can send instructions to and get reports
      from any formian within her range.
    </p>
    <p>She is about 10 feet long, perhaps 4 feet high, and weighs about 3,500 pounds.</p>
    <p>The queen speaks Formian and Common, although she can communicate with any creature telepathically.</p>
    <h4 id="formian--queen--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      The queen does not fight. She has no ability to move. If necessary, a team of workers and myrmarchs (or dominated
      slaves) haul her enormous bulk to where she needs to go. This sort of occurrence is very rare, however, and most
      of the time the queen remains within her well-defended chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite her utter lack of physical activity, the queen can cast spells and use spell-like abilities to great
      effect in her own defense as well as the defense of the hive-city.

      A frost worn cannot burrow through stone, but can manage ice and frozen earth. When moving through such hard
      materials it leaves behind a usable tunnel about 5 feet in diameter.
    </p>
    <p>A frost worm is about 40 feet long, 5 feet in diameter, and weighs about 8,000 pounds.</p>
    <h3 id="frost-worm--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>Frost worms lurk under the snow, waiting for prey to come near.</p>
    <p>They begin an attack with a trill and then set upon helpless prey with their bite.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="frost-worm--combat--trill-su">Trill (Su):</strong> A frost worm can emit a noise that forces its prey
      to stand motionless. This sonic mind-affecting compulsion affects all creatures other than frost worms within a
      100-foot radius. Creatures must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be stunned for as long as the worm trills and for
      1d4 rounds thereafter, even if they are attacked. However, if attacked or violently shaken (a full-round action),
      a victim is allowed another saving throw. Once a creature has resisted or broken the effect, it cannot be affected
      again by that same frost worm’s trill for 24 hours. The effect’s caster level is 14th. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="frost-worm--combat--cold-ex">Cold (Ex):</strong> A frost worm’s body generates intense cold, causing
      opponents to take an extra 1d8 points of cold damage every time the creature succeeds on a bite attack. Creatures
      attacking a frost worm unarmed or with natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks
      hits.

      <strong id="frost-worm--combat--breath-weapon-su">Breath Weapon (Su):</strong> 30-foot cone, once per hour, damage
      15d6 cold, Reflex DC 22 half. Opponents held motionless by the frost worm’s trill get no saving throw. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.

      <strong id="frost-worm--combat--death-throes-ex">Death Throes (Ex):</strong> When killed, a frost worm turns to
      ice and shatters in an explosion that deals 12d6 points of cold damage and 8d6 points of piercing damage to
      everything within 100 feet (Reflex half DC 22). The save DC is Constitution-based.

    <p>
      Shriekers and violet fungi often work together to attract and kill prey. When the shriekers’ hellish racket
      attracts a curious creature, the violet fungus tries to kill it. Both creatures enjoy the fruits of a successful
      hunt.
    </p>
    <h3 id="fungus--shrieker">Shrieker</h3>
    <p>
      A shrieker is a stationary fungus that emits a loud noise to attract prey or when disturbed. Shriekers live in
      dark, subterranean places, often in the company of violet fungi, whose poison they are immune to.
    </p>
    <p>Shriekers come in of shades of purple.</p>
    <h4 id="fungus--shrieker--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>A shrieker has no means of attack. Instead, it lures prey to its vicinity by emitting a loud noise.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="fungus--shrieker--combat--shriek-ex">Shriek (Ex):</strong> Movement or a light source within 10 feet
      of a shrieker causes the fungus to emit a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds. The sound attracts nearby
      creatures that are disposed to investigate it. Some creatures that live near shriekers come to learn that the
      fungus’s noise means there is food nearby.
    </p>
    <h3 id="fungus--violet-fungus">Violet Fungus</h3>
    <p>Violet fungi resemble shriekers and are often found growing among them.</p>
    <p>A violet fungi’s coloration ranges from purple overall to dull gray or violet covered with purple spots.</p>
    <h4 id="fungus--violet-fungus--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>A violet fungus flails about with its tentacles at living creatures that come within its reach.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="fungus--violet-fungus--combat--poison-ex">Poison (Ex):</strong> Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and
