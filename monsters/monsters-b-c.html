    <p>
      A barghest is a lupine fiend that can take the shape of a wolf or a goblin. In its natural form, it resembles a
      goblin–wolf hybrid with terrible jaws and sharp claws. As whelps, barghests are nearly indistinguishable from
      wolves, except for their size and claws. As they grow larger and stronger, their skin darkens to bluishred and
      eventually becomes blue altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      A full-grown barghest is about 6 feet long and weighs 180 pounds. A barghest’s eyes glow orange when the creature
      becomes excited.
    </p>
    <p>Barghests speak Goblin, Worg, and Infernal.</p>
    <h3 id="barghest--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Barghests can claw and bite, no matter what their form, and usually disdain weapons. Though they love killing,
      they have little stomach for direct combat and attack from ambush whenever possible. Barghests start a combat by
      using <i>crushing despair</i> and <i>charm monster</i> to keep opponents off balance. They try to stay away from
      the enemy’s main strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      A barghest’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for
      the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of
      overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barghest--combat--spell-like-abilities">Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> At will—<i
        >blink, levitate, misdirection</i
      >
      (DC 14), <i>rage</i> (DC 15); 1/day—<i>charm monster</i> (DC 16), <i>crushing despair</i> (DC 16),
      <i>dimension door.</i> Caster level equals the barghest’s HD.
    </p>
    <p>The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barghest--combat--feed-su">Feed (Su):</strong> When a barghest slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed
      on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding destroys the victim’s body and
      prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a
      <i>wish, miracle,</i> or <i>true resurrection</i> spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each
      destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      A barghest advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a barghest
      devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength, Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus
      and saves improve as normal for an outsider of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill points, feats, and ability score
      improvements normally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barghest only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels are equal to or greater
      than its own current total. A barghest that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a greater
      barghest upon completion of the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barghest--combat--change-shape-su">Change Shape (Su):</strong> A barghest can assume the shape of a
      goblin or a wolf as a standard action. In goblin form, a barghest cannot use its natural weapons but can wield
      weapons and wear armor. In wolf form, a barghest loses its claw attacks but retains its bite attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barghest--combat--pass-without-trace-ex">Pass Without Trace (Ex):</strong> A barghest in wolf form can
      use pass without trace (as the spell) as a free action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barghest--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> *A barghest in wolf form gains a +4 circumstance bonus on
      Hide checks.
    </p>
    <h3 id="barghest--greater-barghest">Greater Barghest</h3>
    <p>
      A barghest that reaches 9 Hit Dice through feeding becomes a greater barghest. These creatures can change shape
      into a goblinlike creature of Large size (about 8 feet tall and 400 pounds) or a dire wolf. In goblin form, a
      greater barghest cannot use its natural weapons but can wield weapons and wear armor. In dire wolf form, a greater
      barghest loses its claw attacks but retains its bite attack.
    </p>
    <p>A greater barghest can reach a maximum of 18 Hit Dice through feeding.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barghest--greater-barghest--spell-like-abilities">Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> In addition to the
      spelllike abilities all barghests possess, a greater barghest gains the following abilities. At will—<i
        >invisibility sphere;</i
      >
      1/day—<i>mass bull’s strength</i>, <i>mass enlarge.</i> Caster level equals the greater barghest’s HD.
    </p>
    <h4 id="barghest--greater-barghest--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Occasionally, a greater barghest uses a magic two-handed weapon in combat instead of its claws, giving it multiple
      attacks (attack bonus +13/+8). It can also make one bite attack (attack bonus +8) each round. The save DC against
      a greater barghest’s spell-like abilities is 14 + spell level.

    <p>
      A basilisk is a reptilian monster that petrifies living creatures with a mere gaze. A basilisk usually has a dull
      brown body with a yellowish underbelly. Some specimens sport a short, curved horn atop the nose. An adult
      basilisk’s body grows to about 6 feet long, not including its tail, which can reach an additional length of 5 to 7
      feet. The creature weighs about 300 pounds.
    </p>
    <h3 id="basilisk--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A basilisk relies on its gaze attack, biting only when opponents come within reach. Though it has eight legs, its
      slow metabolism renders it relatively sluggish, so it does not expend energy unnecessarily. Intruders who flee a
      basilisk rather than fight can expect, at best, a halfhearted pursuit. These creatures tend to spend most of their
      time lying in wait for prey, which includes small mammals, birds, reptiles, and similar creatures.

      The behir is a serpentine monster that can slither like a snake or use its dozen legs to move with considerable
      speed. A behir is about 40 feet long and weighs about 4,000 pounds. It can fold its limbs close to its long,
      narrow body and slither in snake fashion if it desires. The coloration of behirs ranges from ultramarine to deep
      blue with bands of gray-brown. The belly is pale blue. The two large horns curving back over the head look
      dangerous but are actually used for preening the creature’s scales, not for fighting.
    </p>
    <p>Behirs speak Common.</p>
    <h3 id="behir--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A behir usually bites and grabs its prey first, then either swallows or constricts the opponent. It can employ its
      claws only against foes caught in its coils. If beset by a large number of foes, it uses its breath weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="behir--combat--breath-weapon-su">Breath Weapon (Su):</strong> 20-foot line, once every 10 rounds,
      damage 7d6 electricity, Reflex DC 19 half. The save DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="behir--combat--constrict-ex">Constrict (Ex):</strong> A behir deals 2d8+8 points of damage with a
      successful grapple check. It can make six rake attacks against a grappled foe as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="behir--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a behir must hit a
      creature of any size with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
      provoking an attack of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it wins the grapple check, it it establishes a hold and can attempt to constrict the opponent or swallow the
      opponent in the following round.
    </p>
    <p><strong id="behir--combat--rake-ex">Rake (Ex):</strong> Six claws, attack bonus +15 melee, damage 1d4+4.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="behir--combat--swallow-whole-ex">Swallow Whole (Ex):</strong> A behir can try to swallow a grabbed
      Medium or smaller opponent by making a successful grapple check.
    </p>
    <p>A behir that swallows an opponent can use its Cleave feat to bite and grab another opponent.</p>
    <p>
      A swallowed creature takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage and 8 points of acid damage per round from the
      behir’s gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25
      points of damage to the gizzard (AC 15). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another
      swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.
    </p>
    <p>A behir’s gizzard can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or smaller opponents.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="behir--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> Behirs have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always
      choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

      Belkers are creatures from the Plane of Air. They are composed primarily of smoke. Although undeniably evil, they
      are very reclusive and usually have no interest in the affairs of others. A belker’s winged shape makes it look
      distinctly demonic. It is about 7 feet long and weighs about 8 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>Belkers speak Auran.</p>
    <h3 id="belker--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>In most cases, a belker fights with its nasty claws and painful bite.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="belker--combat--smoke-claws-ex">Smoke Claws (Ex):</strong> A belker in smoke form (see below) can
      engulf opponents by moving on top of them. It fills the air around one Medium or smaller opponent without
      provoking an attack of opportunity. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or inhale part of the
      creature. The save DC is Constitution-based. Smoke inside the victim solidifies into a claw and begins to rip at
      the surrounding organs, dealing 3d4 points of damage per round. An affected creature can attempt another Fortitude
      save each subsequent round to cough out the semivaporous menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="belker--combat--smoke-form-su">Smoke Form (Su):</strong> Most of the time a belker is more or less
      solid, but at will it can assume smoke form. It can switch forms once per round as a free action and can spend up
      to 20 rounds per day in smoke form. A belker in smoke form can fly at a speed of 50 feet (perfect). The ability is
      otherwise similar to a <i>gaseous form</i> spell (caster level 7th).

      In addition to their natural form, bralanis can assume the shape of a whirlwind or zephyr of dust, snow, or sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bralanis speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate with almost any creature, thanks to their
      <i>tongues</i> ability.

    <p>Bralanis prefer the scimitar and bow, the weapons of the desert nomads they most closely resemble.</p>

      whirlwind blast attacks, and use spell-like abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bralani remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does
      the bralani revert to any particular form when killed. A <i>true seeing</i> spell, however, reveals both forms

    <p>
      A bulette attacks anything it regards as edible, choosing the easiest or closest prey first. The only creatures it
      refuses to eat are elves (and it dislikes the taste of dwarves). When burrowing underground, a landshark relies on
      its tremorsense ability to detect prey.
    </p>

      When it senses something edible (that is, senses movement), it breaks to the surface, crest first, and begins its

      The horrific creatures known as chaos beasts have mutable, ever-changing forms. A chaos beast’s dimensions vary,
      but it always weighs about 200 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>Chaos beasts do not speak.</p>
    <h3 id="chaos-beast--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      For all its fearsome appearances, whether it has claws, fangs, pincers, tentacles, or spines, a chaos beast does
      little physical harm. Regardless of form, the creature seems unable to manage more than two attacks per round. Its
      continual transmutations prevent the coordination needed to do more.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chaos beast’s claw attacks, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of
      overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="chaos-beast--combat--corporeal-instability-su">Corporeal Instability (Su):</strong> A blow from a
      chaos beast against a living creature can cause a terrible transformation. The creature must succeed on a DC 15
      Fortitude save or become a spongy, amorphous mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below),
      its shape melts, flows, writhes, and boils. The save DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, rings, and helmets become useless. Large
      items worn or carried—armor, backpacks, even shirts—hamper more than help, reducing the victim’s Dexterity score
      by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. Searing
      pain courses along the nerves, so strong that the victim cannot act coherently. The victim cannot cast spells or
      use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (–4 penalty on attack rolls and a
      50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each round the victim spends in an amorphous state causes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the
      victim’s Wisdom score falls to 0, it becomes a chaos beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      A victim can regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Charisma check (this check DC
      does not vary for a chaos beast with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creature’s
      normal form for 1 minute. On a failure, the victim can still repeat this check each round until successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corporeal instability is not a disease or a curse and so is hard to remove. A <i>shapechange</i> or
      <i>stoneskin</i> spell does not cure an afflicted creature but fixes its form for the duration of the spell. A
      <i>restoration, heal,</i> or <i>greater restoration</i> spell removes the affliction (a separate
      <i>restoration</i> is necessary to restore any drained points of Wisdom).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="chaos-beast--combat--immunity-to-transformation-ex">Immunity to Transformation (Ex):</strong> No
      mortal magic can permanently affect or fix a chaos beast’s form. Effects such as polymorphing or petrification
      force the creature into a new shape, but at the start of its next turn it immediately returns to its mutable form
      as a free action.

      A chimera is about 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly 10 feet long, and weighs about 4,000 pounds. A chimera’s
      dragon head might be black, blue, green, red, or white.

    <p>Chimeras can speak Draconic but seldom bother to do so, except when toadying to more powerful creatures.</p>
    <h3 id="chimera--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      The chimera prefers to surprise prey. It often swoops down from the sky or lies concealed until it charges. The
      dragon head can loose a breath weapon instead of biting. Several chimeras attack in concert.

      These vicious little predators lurk underground, grabbing whatever prey happens by. Its hands and feet have spiny
      pads that help the choker grip almost any surface. The creature weighs about 35 pounds.

    <h3 id="choker--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A choker likes to perch near the ceiling, often at intersections, archways, wells, or staircases, and reach down
      to attack its prey. A choker attacks creatures of almost any size, but prefers lone prey of its size or larger. If
      one is very hungry, it may attack a group, but it waits to grab the last creature in line.

      <strong id="choker--combat--constrict-ex">Constrict (Ex):</strong> A choker deals 1d3+3 points of damage with a
      successful grapple check against a Large or smaller creature. Because it seizes its victim by the neck, a creature
      in the choker’s grasp cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="choker--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a choker must hit
      a Large or smaller opponent with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
      without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
      Chokers receive a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks, which is already included in the statistics block.
    </p>

      <strong id="choker--combat--quickness-su">Quickness (Su):</strong> Although not particularly dexterous, a choker

      A horrible mix of crustacean, insect, and serpent, the chuul is an abomination that lurks submerged or partially
      submerged, awaiting intelligent prey to devour. Although amphibious, chuuls are not good swimmers and actually
      prefer to be on land or in very shallow water when they attack. A chuul is about 8 feet long and weighs 650
      pounds.
    </p>
    <p>Chuuls speak Common (or Undercommon, for the underground variety).</p>
    <h3 id="chuul--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A chuul prefers to wait by the shore, submerged in murky water, until it hears nearby prey (in or out of the
      water) that it can attack with surprise. A chuul grabs with its claws and constricts its foe, then passes the
      opponent to its paralytic tentacles. It tries to always have one claw free, so if it faces a large number of
      opponents, it drops a paralyzed or dead victim and continues attempting to grab, constrict, and paralyze the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="chuul--combat--constrict-ex">Constrict (Ex):</strong> On a successful grapple check, a chuul deals
      3d6+5 points of damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="chuul--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a chuul must hit
      with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
      opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict or on its next turn transfer a
      grabbed opponent to its tentacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="chuul--combat--paralytic-tentacles-ex">Paralytic Tentacles (Ex):</strong> A chuul can transfer grabbed
      victims from a claw to its ten- tacles as a move action. The tentacles grapple with the same strength as the claw
      but deal no damage. However, they exude a paralytic secretion. Anyone held in the tentacles must succeed on a DC
      19 Fortitude save each round on the chuul’s turn or be paralyzed for 6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
      While held in the tentacles, paralyzed or not, a victim automatically takes 1d8+2 points of damage each round from
      the creature’s mandibles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="chuul--combat--amphibious-ex">Amphibious (Ex):</strong> Although chuuls are aquatic, they can survive
      indefinitely on land.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="chuul--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> A chuul has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
      some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or
      endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

      When resting or lying in wait, these creatures are almost impossible to distinguish from common black cloaks (the
      cloaker’s ivory claws look very much like bone clasps). Only when it unfurls does the horrific nature of the
      creature become apparent.
    </p>
    <p>A cloaker has a wingspan of about 8 feet. It weighs about 100 pounds.</p>
    <p>Cloakers speak Undercommon.</p>
    <h3 id="cloaker--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Cloakers usually lie still, watching and listening for prey. If facing a single opponent, a cloaker uses its
      engulf attack. Against multiple foes, it lashes with its tail in concert with its moan and shadow shift abilities
      to reduce the opposition’s numbers, then engulfs a survivor. Multiple cloakers usually split up, leaving one or
      two behind to use special abilities while the rest make melee attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="cloaker--combat--moan-ex">Moan (Ex):</strong> A cloaker can emit a dangerous subsonic moan as a
      standard action. By changing the frequency, the cloaker can cause one of four effects. Cloakers are immune to
      these sonic, mindaffecting attacks. Unless otherwise specified, a creature that successfully saves against one of
      these effects cannot be affected by the same moan effect from the same cloaker for 24 hours. All save DCs for moan
      effects are Charisma-based.

    <p>
      <em id="cloaker--combat--moan-ex--unnerve">Unnerve:</em> Anyone within a 60-foot spread automatically takes a –2
      penalty on attack and damage rolls. Those forced to hear the moan for more than 6 consecutive rounds must succeed
      on a DC 15 Will save or enter a trance, unable to attack or defend themselves until the moaning stops.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="cloaker--combat--moan-ex--fear">Fear:</em> Anyone within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a DC 15 Will
      save or become panicked for 2 rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="cloaker--combat--moan-ex--nausea">Nausea:</em> Anyone in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude
      save or be overcome by nausea and weakness.
    </p>
    <p>Affected characters fall prone and become nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="cloaker--combat--moan-ex--stupor">Stupor:</em> A single creature within 30 feet of the cloaker must
      succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a <i>hold monster</i> spell for 5 rounds. Even after
      a successful save, the creature must repeat the save if the cloaker uses this effect again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="cloaker--combat--engulf-ex">Engulf (Ex):</strong> A cloaker can try to wrap a Medium or smaller
      creature in its body as a standard action. The cloaker attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and bites the engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on
      its attack roll. It can still use its whiplike tail to strike at other targets.
    </p>
    <p>Attacks that hit an engulfing cloaker deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="cloaker--combat--shadow-shift-su">Shadow Shift (Su):</strong> A cloaker can manipulate shadows. This
      ability is effective only in shadowy areas and has three possible effects.

    <p>A couatl is about 12 feet long, with a wingspan of about 15 feet. It weighs about 1,800 pounds.</p>
    <p>Couatls speak Celestial, Common, and Draconic, and also have the power of telepathy (see below).</p>
    <h3 id="couatl--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A couatl uses its <i>detect thoughts</i> ability on any creature that arouses its suspicions. Since it is highly
      intelligent, a couatl usually casts spells from a distance before closing. If more than one couatl is involved,
      they discuss their strategy before a battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="couatl--combat--constrict-ex">Constrict (Ex):</strong> A couatl deals 2d8+6 points of damage with a
      successful grapple check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="couatl--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a couatl must hit
      a creature of up to two size categories larger with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a
      free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and
      can constrict.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="couatl--combat--poison-ex">Poison (Ex):</strong> Injury, Fortitude DC 16, initial damage 2d4 Str,
      secondary damage 4d4 Str.
    </p>
    <p>The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="couatl--combat--psionics-sp">Psionics (Sp):</strong> At will—<i
        >detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect thoughts</i
      >
      (DC 15), <i>invisibility, plane shift</i> (DC 20), <i>polymorph</i> (self only). Effective caster level 9th. The
      save DCs are Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p><strong id="couatl--combat--spells">Spells:</strong> A couatl casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer.</p>
    <p>
      It can choose its spells known from the sorcerer list, the cleric list, and from the lists for the Air, Good, and
      Law domains. The cleric spells and domain spells are considered arcane spells for a couatl, meaning that the
      creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Typical Spells Known</i> (6/7/7/7/4; save DC 13 + spell level): 0—<i

      >
      1st—<i>endure elements, mage armor, protection from chaos, true strike, wind wall;</i> 2nd—<i

      <i>charm monster, freedom of movement.</i>
    </p>

      <strong id="couatl--combat--ethereal-jaunt-su">Ethereal Jaunt (Su):</strong> This ability works like the
      <i>ethereal jaunt</i> spell (caster level 16th).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="couatl--combat--telepathy-su">Telepathy (Su):</strong> A couatl can communicate telepathically with
      any creature within 90 feet that has an Intelligence score. The creature can respond to the couatl if it wishes—no
      common language is needed.
