    <h1>IMPROVING MONSTERS</h1>
    <p>
      Each of the monster entries describes a typical creature of its kind. However, there are several methods by which
      extraordinary or unique monsters can be created using a typical creature as the foundation: by adding character
      classes, increasing a monster’s Hit Dice, or by adding a template to a monster. These methods are not mutually
      exclusive—it’s possible for a monster with a template to be improved by both increasing its Hit Dice and adding
      character class levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Class Levels:</strong> Intelligent creatures that are reasonably humanoid in shape most commonly advance
      by adding class levels. Creatures that fall into this category have an entry of “By character class” in their
      Advancement line. When a monster adds a class level, that level usually represents an increase in experience and
      learned skills and capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Increased Hit Dice:</strong> Intelligent creatures that are not humanoid in shape, and nonintelligent
      monsters, can advance by increasing their Hit Dice. Creatures with increased Hit Dice are usually superior
      specimens of their race, bigger and more powerful than their run-of-the-mill fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Templates:</strong> Both intelligent and nonintelligent creatures with an unusual heritage or an inflicted
      change in their essential nature may be modified with a template. Templates usually result in tougher monsters
      with capabilities that differ from those of their common kin.
    </p>
    <p>Each of these three methods for improving monsters is discussed in more detail below.</p>

    <h2 id="ability-score-arrays">Ability Score Arrays</h2>
    <p>
      Monsters are assumed to have completely average (or standard) ability scores—a 10 or an 11 in each ability, as
      modified by their racial bonuses. However, improved monsters are individuals and often have better than normal
      ability scores, and usually make use of either the elite array or the nonelite array of ability scores. Monsters
      who improve by adding a template, and monsters who improve by increasing their Hit Dice, may use any of the three
      arrays (standard, nonelite, or elite). Any monster unique enough to be improved could easily be considered elite.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Elite Array:</strong> The elite array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. While the monster has one weakness
      compared to a typical member of its race, it is significantly better overall. The elite array is most appropriate
      for monsters who add levels in a player character class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nonelite Array:</strong> The nonelite array is 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. The nonelite array does not
      necessarily make a monster better than normal, but it does customize the monster as an individual with strengths
      and weaknesses compared to a typical member of its race. The nonelite array is most appropriate for monsters who
      add class levels in a NPC class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Treat monster Hit Dice the same as character level for determining
      ability score increases. This only applies to Hit Dice increases, monsters do not gain ability score increases for
      levels they “already reached” with their racial Hit Dice, since these adjustments are included in their basic
      ability scores.
    </p>
    <h2 id="monsters-and-class-levels">Monsters and Class Levels</h2>
    <p>If a creature acquires a character class, it follows the rules for multiclass characters.</p>
    <p>
      The creature’s Hit Dice equal the number of class levels it has plus its racial Hit Dice. A creature’s “monster
      class” is always a favored class, and the creature never takes XP penalties for having it. Additional Hit Dice
      gained from taking levels in a character class never affect a creature’s size.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Humanoids and Class Levels:</strong> Creatures with 1 or less HD replace their monster levels with their
      character levels. The monster loses the attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skills, and feats granted by its 1
      monster HD and gains the attack bonus, save bonuses, skills, feats, and other class abilities of a 1st-level
      character of the appropriate class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Level Adjustment and Effective Character Level:</strong> To determine the effective character level (ECL)
      of a monster character, add its level adjustment to its racial Hit Dice and character class levels. The monster is
      considered to have experience points equal to the minimum needed to be a character of its ECL.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you choose to equip a monster with gear, use its ECL as its character level for purposes of determining how
      much equipment it can purchase. Generally, only monsters with an Advancement entry of “By character class” receive
      NPC gear; other creatures adding character levels should be treated as monsters of the appropriate CR and assigned
      treasure, not equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Feat Acquisition and Ability Score Increases:</strong> A monster’s total Hit Dice, not its ECL, govern its
      acquisition of feats and ability score increases.
    </p>
    <h2 id="increasing-hit-dice">Increasing Hit Dice</h2>
    <p>
      As its Hit Dice increase, a creature’s attack bonuses and saving throw modifiers might improve. It gains more
      feats and skills, depending on its type, as shown on Table: Creature Improvement by Type.
    </p>
    <p>Note that if a creature acquires a character class, it improves according to its class, not its type.</p>

    <h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
    <p>
      Certain creatures are created by adding a template to an existing creature. A templated creature can represent a
      freak of nature, the individual creation of a single experimenter, or the first generation of offspring from
      parents of different species.
    </p>
    <h3 id="acquired-and-inherited-templates">Acquired and Inherited Templates</h3>
    <p>
      Some templates can be added to creatures anytime. Templates such as these are referred to as acquired templates,
      indicating that the creature did not always have the attributes of the template.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other templates, known as inherited templates, are part of a creature from the beginning of its existence.
      Creatures are born with these templates.
    </p>
    <p>It’s possible for a certain kind of template to be of either type.</p>
    <h3 id="reading-a-template">Reading a Template</h3>
    <p>
      A template’s description provides a set of instructions for altering an existing creature, known as the base
      creature. The changes that a template might cause to each line of a creature ’s statistics block are discussed
      below. Generally, if a template does not cause a change to a certain statistic, that entry is missing from the
      template description. For clarity, the entry for a statistic or attribute that is not changed is sometimes given
      as “Same as the base creature.”
    </p>
    <p><strong>Size and Type:</strong> Templates often change a creature’s type, and may change the creature’s size.</p>
    <p>
      If a template changes the base creature’s type, the creature also acquires the augmented subtype unless the
      template description indicates otherwise. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature’s original
      type. Unless a template indicates otherwise, the new creature has the traits of the new type but the features of
      the original type.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a template changes a creature’s size, use Table: Changes to Statistics by Size to calculate changes to natural
      armor, Armor Class, attack rolls, and grapple bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hit Dice and Hit Points:</strong> Most templates do not change the number of Hit Dice a monster has, but
      some do. Some templates change the size of a creature’s Hit Dice (usually by changing the creature type). A few
      templates change previously acquired Hit Dice, and continue to change Hit Dice gained with class levels, but most
      templates that change Hit Dice change only the creature’s original HD and leave class Hit Dice unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Hit Dice entry in a template description is missing, Hit Dice and hit points do not change unless the
      creature’s Constitution modifier changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Initiative:</strong> If a template changes the monster’s Dexterity, or if it adds or removes the Improved
      Initiative feat, this entry changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Speed:</strong> If a template modifies a creature’s speed, the template states how that happens. More
      commonly, a template adds a new movement mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Armor Class:</strong> If a template changes the creature’s size, see Table: Changes to Statistics by Size
      to determine its new Armor Class and to see whether its natural armor changes. In some cases the method of
      determining Armor Class changes radically; the template description explains how to adjust the creature’s AC.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Base Attack/Grapple:</strong> Templates usually do not change a creature’s base attack bonus. If a
      template modifies a creature’s base attack bonus, the template description states how that happens. Changes to a
      creature’s Strength score can change a creature’s grapple bonus, as can changes to its size.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Attack and Full Attack:</strong> Most templates do not change a creature’s attack bonus or modes of
      attack, even when the creature’s type changes (the creature’s base attack bonus is the same as a creature of the
      original type). Of course, any change in ability scores may affect attack bonuses. If Strength or Dexterity
      changes, use the new modifier to determine attack bonuses. A change in a monster’s size also changes its attack
      bonus; see Table: Changes to Statistics by Size.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Damage:</strong> Damage changes with Strength. If the creature uses a two-handed weapon or has a single
      natural weapon, it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to the damage. If it has more than a single attack then it
      adds its Strength bonus to damage rolls for the primary attack and 1/2 its Strength bonus to all secondary
      attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Space/Reach:</strong> A template may change this entry if it changes the monster’s size. Note that this
      table does not take into account special situations such as exceptional reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A template may add or remove special attacks. The template description gives the
      details of any special attacks a template provides, including how to determine saving throw DCs, if applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A template may add or remove special qualities. The template description gives
      the details of any special qualities a template provides, including how to determine saving throw DCs, if
      applicable. Even if the special qualities entry is missing from a template description, the creature still gains
      any qualities associated with its new type.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Base Saves:</strong> As with attacks, changing a monster’s type does not always change its base saving
      throw bonuses. You only need to adjust them for new modifiers for Constitution, Dexterity, or Wisdom. A template
      may, however, state that a monster has a different “good” saving throw.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Abilities:</strong> If a template changes one or more ability scores, these changes are noted here.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Skills:</strong> As with attacks, changing a monster’s type does not always change its skill points. Most
      templates don’t change the number of Hit Dice a creature has, so you don’t need to adjust skills in that case
      unless the key abilities for those skills have changed, or the template gives a bonus on one or more skills, or
      unless the template gives a feat that provides a bonus on a skill check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some templates change how skill points are determined, but this change usually only affects skill points gained
      after the template is applied. Treat skills listed in the base creature’s description as class skills, as well as
      any new skills provided by the template.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Feats:</strong> Since most templates do not change the number of Hit Dice a creature has, a template will
      not change the number of feats the creature has. Some templates grant one or more bonus feats.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Environment:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
    <p><strong>Organization:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Most templates increase the creature’s Challenge Rating. A template might
      provide a modifier to be added to the base creature’s CR, or it might specify a range of modifiers depending on
      the base creature’s original Hit Dice or CR.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Treasure:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Alignment:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature, unless the template is associated with a
      certain alignment.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Advancement:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Level Adjustment:</strong> This entry is a modifier to the base creature’s level adjustment. Any level
      adjustment is meaningless unless the creature retains a high enough Intelligence (minimum 3) to gain class levels
      after applying the template.
    </p>
    <h4 id="adding-more-than-one-template">Adding More Than One Template</h4>
    <p>
      In theory, there’s no limit to the number of templates you can add to a creature. To add more than one template,
      just apply each template one at a time. Always apply inherited templates before applying acquired templates.
      Whenever you add multiple templates, pay attention to the creature’s type—you may add a template that makes the
      creature ineligible for other templates you might want to add.
    </p>
    <h2 id="advanced-monster-challenge-rating">Advanced Monster Challenge Rating</h2>
    <p>
      When adding class levels to a creature with 1 or less HD, you advance the creature like a character. Otherwise,
      use the following guidelines.
    </p>
    <h3 id="adding-class-levels">Adding Class Levels</h3>
    <p>
      If you are advancing a monster by adding player character class levels, decide if the class levels directly
      improve the monster’s existing capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      When adding class levels to a creature, you should give it typical ability scores appropriate for that class. Most
      creatures are built using the standard array of ability scores: 11, 11, 11, 10, 10, 10, adjusted by racial
      modifiers. If you give a creature a PC class use the elite array of ability scores before racial adjustments: 15,
      14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Creatures with NPC classes use the nonelite array of 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. T
    </p>
    <h4 id="associated-class-levels">Associated Class Levels</h4>
    <p>
      Class levels that increase a monster’s existing strengths are known as associated class levels. Each associated
      class level a monster has increases its CR by 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbarian, fighter, paladin, and ranger are associated classes for a creature that relies on its fighting ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogue and ranger are associated classes for a creature that relies on stealth to surprise its foes, or on skill
      use to give itself an advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spellcasting class is an associated class for a creature that already has the ability to cast spells as a
      character of the class in question, since the monster’s levels in the spellcasting class stack with its innate
      spellcasting ability.
    </p>
    <h4 id="nonassociated-class-levels">Nonassociated Class Levels</h4>
    <p>
      If you add a class level that doesn’t directly play to a creature’s strength the class level is considered
      nonassociated, and things get a little more complicated. Adding a nonassociated class level to a monster increases
      its CR by 1/2 per level until one of its nonassociated class levels equals its original Hit Dice. At that point,
      each additional level of the same class or a similar one is considered associated and increases the monster’s CR
      by 1.
    </p>
    <p>Levels in NPC classes are always treated as nonassociated.</p>
    <h3 id="adding-hit-dice">Adding Hit Dice</h3>
    <p>
      When you improve a monster by adding Hit Dice, use Table: Improved Monster CR Increase to determine the effect on
      the creature’s CR. Keep in mind that many monsters that advance by adding Hit Dice also increase in size. Do not
      stack this CR increase with any increase from class levels. In general, once you’ve doubled a creature’s CR, you
      should closely watch any additional increases in its abilities. Adding Hit Dice to a creature improves several of
      its abilities, and radical increases might not follow this progression indefinitely. Compare the monster’s
      improved attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and any DCs of its special abilities from the HD increase to typical
      characters of the appropriate level and adjust the CR accordingly.

    <h3 id="increasing-size">Increasing Size</h3>
    <p>
      Generally, increasing a monster’s size increases its combat effectiveness. Large creatures gain increased
      Strength, reach, and other benefits. Apply this modifier if you increase a creature beyond Medium and in
      conjunction with any other increases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be careful, though. Monsters that benefit from a smaller size may actually lose effectiveness because of a size
      increase. Monsters that don’t benefit from size increases don’t advance in that manner for this reason.
    </p>
    <h3 id="adding-special-abilities">Adding Special Abilities</h3>
    <p>
      You can add any sort of spell-like, supernatural, or extraordinary ability to a creature. As with a class level,
      you should determine how much, or how little, this ability adds to the creature’s existing repertoire. A suite of
      abilities that work together should be treated as a single modifier for this purpose. If the ability (or
      combination of abilities) significantly increases the monster’s combat effectiveness, increase its CR by 2. Minor
      abilities increase the creature’s CR by 1, and truly trivial abilities may not increase CR at all. If the special
      abilities a monster gains are not tied to a class or Hit Die increase, this CR increase stacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A significant special attack is one that stands a good chance of incapacitating or crippling a character in one
      round. A significant special quality is one that seriously diminishes the monster’s vulnerability to common
      attacks. Do not add this factor twice if a monster has both special attacks and special qualities.
    </p>
    <p>Make sure to “scale” your evaluation of these abilities by the monster’s current CR.</p>
