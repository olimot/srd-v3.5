    <p>The tarrasque is 70 feet long and 50 feet tall, and it weighs about 130 tons.</p>
    <p>The tarrasque cannot speak.</p>
    <h3 id="tarrasque--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>The tarrasque attacks with its claws, teeth, horns, and tail.</p>
    <p>The tarrasque’s natural weapons are treated as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tarrasque--combat--augmented-critical-ex">Augmented Critical (Ex):</strong> The tarrasque’s bite
      threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 18–20, dealing triple damage on a successful critical hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tarrasque--combat--frightful-presence-su">Frightful Presence (Su):</strong> The tarrasque can inspire
      terror by charging or attacking. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 36 Will save or become shaken, remaining
      in that condition as long as they remain with 60 feet of the tarrasque. The save DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tarrasque--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, the tarrasque
      must hit a Huge or smaller opponent with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
      without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to
      swallow the foe the following round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tarrasque--combat--rush-ex">Rush (Ex):</strong> Once per minute, the normally slow-moving tarrasque
      can move at a speed of 150 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tarrasque--combat--swallow-whole-ex">Swallow Whole (Ex):</strong> The tarrasque can try to swallow a
      grabbed opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes
      2d8+8 points of crushing damage plus 2d8+6 points of acid damage per round from the tarrasque’s digestive juices.
      A swallowed creature can cut its way out by dealing 50 points of damage to the tarrasque’s digestive tract (AC
      25). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way
      out. The tarrasque’s gullet can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, or 512 Tiny or smaller creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tarrasque--combat--carapace-ex">Carapace (Ex):</strong> The tarrasque’s armorlike carapace is
      exceptionally tough and highly reflective, deflecting all rays, lines, cones, and even <i>magic missile</i>spells.
      There is a 30% chance of reflecting any such effect back at the caster; otherwise, it is merely negated. Check for
      reflection before rolling to overcome the creature’s spell resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tarrasque--combat--regeneration-ex">Regeneration (Ex):</strong> No form of attack deals lethal damage
      to the tarrasque. The tarrasque regenerates even if it fails a saving throw against a <i>disintegrate</i> spell or
      a death effect. If the tarrasque fails its save against a spell or effect that would kill it instantly (such as
      those mentioned above), the spell or effect instead deals nonlethal damage equal to the creature’s full normal hit
      points +10 (or 868 hp). The tarrasque is immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding wounds, such as
      mummy rot, a sword with the wounding special ability, or a clay golem’s cursed wound ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tarrasque can be slain only by raising its nonlethal damage total to its full normal hit points +10 (or 868
      hit points) and using a
      <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell to keep it dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the tarrasque loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes (the detached piece dies and
      decays normally). The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tarrasque--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> The tarrasque has a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
      checks.

    <p>A tendriculos can rear up to a height of 15 feet. It weighs about 3,500 pounds.</p>
    <p>
      Animals and other plant creatures are unnerved by the presence of a tendriculos; they avoid it and any place it
      has been within the last 24 hours.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tendriculos--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Prowling deep forests or waiting in vegetated areas (looking like nothing more than a small hillock), a
      tendriculos attacks savagely, showing no fear. It attempts to swallow as much flesh as it can, as quickly as it
      can.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tendriculos--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a tendriculos
      must hit a creature at least one size smaller than itself with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a
      grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes
      a hold and can try to swallow the opponent in the following round. A tendriculos can also use its improved grab
      ability on a tendril attack. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold, picks up the opponent, and
      transfers it to the mouth as a free action, automatically dealing bite damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tendriculos--combat--swallow-wholeparalysis-ex">Swallow Whole/Paralysis (Ex):</strong> A tendriculos
      can try to swallow a grabbed opponent by making a successful grapple check. Once inside the plant’s mass, the
      opponent must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds by the tendriculos’s digestive
      juices, taking 2d6 points of acid damage per round. A new save is required each round inside the plant. The save
      DC is Constitution-based. A swallowed creature that avoids paralysis can climb out of the mass with a successful
      grapple check. This returns it to the plant’s maw, where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. A
      swallowed creature can also cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of
      damage to the tendriculos’s interior (AC 14). Once the creature exits, the plant’s regenerative capacity closes
      the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Huge tendriculos’s interior can hold 2 Large, 8
      Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or smaller opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tendriculos--combat--regeneration-ex">Regeneration (Ex):</strong> Bludgeoning weapons and acid deal
      normal damage to a tendriculos. A tendriculos that loses part of its body mass can regrow it in 1d6 minutes.
      Holding the severed portion against the mass enables it to reattach instantly.

    <p>A thoqqua is about 1 foot in diameter and 4 to 5 feet long. It weighs about 200 pounds.</p>
    <h3 id="thoqqua--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      When a thoqqua is disturbed, its first instinct is to attack. Its favored tactic is to spring directly at a foe,
      either by bursting out of the rock or by coiling up its body and launching itself like a spring. (Treat this as a
      charge, even though the thoqqua does not need to move 10 feet before attacking.)

      rounds if not extinguished sooner. A burning creature can use a full-round action to put out the flame.

      Titans enjoy combat and usually close with their foes. If that proves ineffective, they swiftly back off and pelt
      the foe with spell-like abilities and magical effects. Because of a titan’s Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat, it
      can use <i>chain lightning</i> as a free action, and frequently attacks in melee while lashing out with this
      ability at the same time.

      A tojanida’s shell is blue-green in color. Inside the shell is a fleshy body from which extend seven stalks. Four
      of these stalks have paddles for locomotion, two are tipped with claws, and one bears the creature’s head. Eight
      vents in the shell, four at each end, allow the tojanida to thrust its stalks out in whatever configuration it
      finds convenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      A juvenile tojanida is up to 25 years old. It has a shell about 3 feet long, and it weighs about 60 pounds. An
      adult is aged 26 to 80. Its shell is about 6 feet long, and it weighs about 220 pounds. An elder can reach 150
      years of age. It has a shell about 9 feet long, and it weighs about 500 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>Tojanidas speak Aquan and can be loquacious, but usually only on the subject of food.</p>
    <h3 id="tojanida--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      <strong id="tojanida--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a tojanida must
      hit with a bite or claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an
      attack of opportunity. Underwater, a tojanida can tow a grabbed victim of its own size or smaller at its swim
      speed (but it cannot run). A favorite tactic is to grab a single opponent, then withdraw, hauling the opponent
      away from its allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tojanida--combat--ink-cloud-ex">Ink Cloud (Ex):</strong> A tojanida can emit a spherical cloud of
      jet-black ink with a radius of 30 feet once per minute as a free action. The effect is otherwise similar to
      <i>fog cloud</i> cast by an individual of a level equal to the tojanida’s Hit Dice. Out of water, the ink emerges
      in a stream up to 30 feet long, which a tojanida can squirt into an opponent’s eyes. The affected creature must
      succeed on a Reflex save or be blinded for 1 round. The save DC is 13 against a juvenile, 15 against an adult, and
      21 against an elder. The save DCs are Constitution based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tojanida--combat--all-around-vision-ex">All-Around Vision (Ex):</strong> The multiple apertures in a
      tojanida’s shell allow it to look in any direction, bestowing a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks.
      Opponents gain no flanking bonuses when attacking a tojanida.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="tojanida--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> A tojanida has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
      perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted
      or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

      A treant’s leaves are deep green in the spring and summer. In the fall and winter the leaves change to yellow,
      orange, or red, but they rarely fall out. A treant’s legs fit together when closed to look like the trunk of a
      tree, and a motionless treant is nearly indistinguishable from a tree.
    </p>
    <p>A treant is about 30 feet tall, with a “trunk” about 2 feet in diameter. It weighs about 4,500 pounds.</p>
    <p>
      Treants speak their own language, plus Common and Sylvan. Most also can manage a smattering of just about all
      other humanoid tongues—at least enough to say “Get away from my trees!”
    </p>
    <h3 id="treant--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Treants prefer to watch potential foes carefully before attacking. They often charge suddenly from cover to

      <strong id="treant--combat--animate-trees-sp"><i>Animate Trees</i> (Sp):</strong> A treant can animate trees
      within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot
      itself. Thereafter it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant in all respects. Animated trees lose
      their ability to move if the treant that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is
      otherwise similar to <i>liveoak</i> (caster level 12th). Animated trees have the same vulnerability to fire that a
      treant has.

    <p>A troglodyte stands about 5 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.</p>
    <p>Troglodytes speak Draconic.</p>
    <h3 id="troglodyte--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Half of a group of troglodytes are armed only with claws and teeth; the rest carry one or two javelins and clubs.
      They normally conceal themselves, launch a volley of javelins, then close to attack. If the battle goes against
      them, they retreat and attempt to hide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stench (Ex): When a troglodyte is angry or frightened, it secretes an oily, musk-like chemical that nearly every
      form of animal life finds offensive. All living creatures (except troglodytes) within 30 feet of a troglodyte must
      succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened for 10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures that
      successfully save cannot be affected by the same troglodyte’s stench for 24 hours. A
      <i>delay poison</i> or <i>neutralize poison</i> spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures
      with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their
      saving throws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skills: The skin of a troglodyte changes color somewhat, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings like a
      chameleon and providing a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. *In rocky or underground settings, this bonus improves
      to +8.
    </p>

    <p>—Darkvision out to 90 feet.</p>
    <p>
      —Racial Hit Dice: A troglodyte begins with two levels of humanoid, which provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus
      of +1, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Racial Skills: A troglodyte’s humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 5 x (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1).
      Its class skills are Hide and Listen. Troglodytes have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks (+8 in rocky or
      underground surroundings).
    </p>

      —Racial Feats: A troglodyte’s humanoid levels give it one feat. A troglodyte receives Multiattack as a bonus feat.

      Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. Their gait is uneven, and when they run, their
      arms dangle and drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical adult troll stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Females are slightly larger than males. A troll’s
      rubbery hide is moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. The hair is usually greenish black or iron
      gray.

    <p>
      Trolls have no fear of death: They launch themselves into combat without hesitation, flailing wildly at the
      closest opponent. Even when confronted with fire, they try to get around the flames and attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="troll--combat--rend-ex">Rend (Ex):</strong> If a troll hits with both claw attacks, it latches onto
      the opponent’s body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 2d6+9 points of damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="troll--combat--regeneration-ex">Regeneration (Ex):</strong> Fire and acid deal normal damage to a
      troll. If a troll loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 3d6 minutes. The creature can reattach
      the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.

      These cousins of the troll have the aquatic subtype. They dwell in any body of water in any climate. They have a
      base land speed of 20 feet and a swim speed of 40 feet and are found only in aquatic environments. They regenerate
      only if mostly immersed in water.

    <h3 id="troll--troll-hunter">Troll Hunter</h3>
    <p>
      Some trolls, more cunning than most, are not satisfied with merely eating civilized beings but train to hunt them
      relentlessly. These troll hunters are fearsome rangers who focus on slaying and devouring humanoid prey.
    </p>
    <h4 id="troll--troll-hunter--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      A troll hunter makes full use of its scent ability to track its favored enemies and generally prefers to hunt in
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The troll hunter uses its limited repertoire of spells to protect itself from damaging forms of energy and to
      immobilize enemies.

    <p>
      Vampires appear just as they did in life, although their features are often hardened and feral, with the predatory
      look of wolves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like liches, they often embrace finery and decadence and may assume the guise of nobility. Despite their human
      appearance, vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and throw no reflections in mirrors.
    </p>
    <p>Vampires speak any languages they knew in life.</p>
    <h3 id="vampire--creating-a-vampire">Creating a Vampire</h3>
    <p>
      “Vampire” is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature (referred to
      hereafter as the base creature).
    </p>
    <p>A vampire uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire--creating-a-vampire--size-and-type">Size and Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to
      undead (augmented humanoid or monstrous humanoid). Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points.
      Size is unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire--creating-a-vampire--hit-dice">Hit Dice:</strong> Increase all current and future Hit Dice to
      d12s.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire--creating-a-vampire--speed">Speed:</strong> Same as the base creature. If the base creature
      has a swim speed, the vampire retains the ability to swim and is not vulnerable to immersion in running water (see
      below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire--creating-a-vampire--armor-class">Armor Class:</strong> The base creature’s natural armor
      bonus improves by +6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire--creating-a-vampire--attack">Attack:</strong> A vampire retains all the attacks of the base
      creature and also gains a slam attack if it didn’t already have one. If the base creature can use weapons, the
      vampire retains this ability. A creature with natural weapons retains those natural weapons. A vampire fighting
      without weapons uses either its slam attack or its primary natural weapon (if it has any). A vampire armed with a
      weapon uses its slam or a weapon, as it desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire--creating-a-vampire--full-attack">Full Attack:</strong> A vampire fighting without weapons
      uses either its slam attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any). If armed with a weapon, it usually
      uses the weapon as its primary attack along with a slam or other natural weapon as a natural secondary attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire--creating-a-vampire--damage">Damage:</strong> Vampires have slam attacks. If the base creature
      does not have this attack form, use the appropriate damage value from the table below according to the vampire’s
      size. Creatures that have other kinds of natural weapons retain their old damage values or use the appropriate
      value from the table below, whichever is better.

      If the vampire instead drains the victim’s Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4
      or less HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn is under the command

      may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this
      limit are created as free-willed vampires or vampire spawn. A vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave
      spawn of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of lesser vampires in this fashion. A vampire may

      assume the shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. This ability is similar to a
      <i>polymorph</i> spell cast by a 12th-level character, except that the vampire does not regain hit points for
      changing form and must choose from among the forms mentioned here. While in its alternate form, the vampire loses
      its natural slam attack and dominate ability, but it gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks
      of its new form. It can remain in that form until it assumes another or until the next sunrise. (If the base

    <h4 id="vampire--creating-a-vampire--vampire-weaknesses">Vampire Weaknesses</h4>
    <p>For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire--creating-a-vampire--vampire-weaknesses--repelling-a-vampire">Repelling a Vampire:</strong>
      Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they
      recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These things don’t harm the vampire—they merely keep it
      at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and
      cannot touch or make melee attacks against the creature holding the item for the rest of the encounter. Holding a
      vampire at bay takes a standard action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they can be carried over it while resting in their
      coffins or aboard a ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless invited in by someone with the authority to do
      so. They may freely enter public places, since these are by definition open to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire--creating-a-vampire--vampire-weaknesses--slaying-a-vampire">Slaying a Vampire:</strong>
      Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it (see the note on fast
      healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It
      can take only a single move action or attack action and is destroyed utterly in the next round if it cannot
      escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water robs it of one-third of its hit points each round until it
      is destroyed at the end of the third round of immersion. Driving a wooden stake through a vampire’s heart
      instantly slays the monster. However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the body is destroyed. A
      popular tactic is to cut off the creature’s head and fill its mouth with holy wafers (or their equivalent).
    </p>
    <h4 id="vampire--creating-a-vampire--vampire-characters">Vampire Characters</h4>
    <p>
      Vampires are always evil, which causes characters of certain classes to lose some class abilities. In addition,
      certain classes take additional penalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire--creating-a-vampire--vampire-characters--clerics">Clerics:</strong> Vampire clerics lose their
      ability to turn undead but gain the ability to rebuke undead. This ability does not affect the vampire’s
      controller or any other vampires that a master controls. A vampire cleric has access to two of the following
      domains: Chaos, Destruction, Evil, or Trickery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire--creating-a-vampire--vampire-characters--sorcerers-and-wizards"
        >Sorcerers and Wizards:</strong
      >
      Vampire sorcerers and wizards retain their class abilities, but if a character has a familiar other than a rat or
      bat, the link between them is broken, and the familiar shuns its former companion. The character can summon
      another familiar, but it must be a rat or bat.

      Vampire spawn are undead creatures that come into being when vampires slay mortals. Like their creators, spawn
      remain bound to their coffins and to the soil of their graves. Vampire spawn appear much as they did in life,
      although their features are often hardened, with a predatory look.
    </p>
    <p>Vampire spawn speak Common.</p>
    <h3 id="vampire-spawn--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Vampire spawn use their inhuman strength when engaging mortals, hammering their foes with powerful blows and
      dashing them against rocks or walls. They also use their gaseous form and flight abilities to strike where
      opponents are most vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire-spawn--combat--blood-drain-ex">Blood Drain (Ex):</strong> A vampire spawn can suck blood from
      a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing
      1d4 points of Constitution drain each round. On each such successful drain attack, the vampire spawn gains 5
      temporary hit pints.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire-spawn--combat--domination-su">Domination (Su):</strong> A vampire spawn can crush an
      opponent’s will just by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except that the vampire
      must take a standard action, and those merely looking at it are not affected. Anyone the vampire targets must
      succeed on a DC 14 Will save or fall instantly under the vampire’s influence as though by a
      <i>dominate person</i> spell from a 5thlevel caster. The ability has a range of 30 feet. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire-spawn--combat--energy-drain-su">Energy Drain (Su):</strong> Living creatures hit by a vampire
      spawn’s slam attack gain one negative level. The DC is 14 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The
      save DC is Charisma-based. For each such negative level bestowed, the vampire spawn gains 5 temporary hit points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire-spawn--combat--fast-healing-ex">Fast Healing (Ex):</strong> A vampire spawn heals 2 points of
      damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically
      assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed.
      (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Once at rest in its coffin, it is helpless. It regains 1 hit point
      after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 2 hit points per round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire-spawn--combat--gaseous-form-su">Gaseous Form (Su):</strong> As a standard action, a vampire
      spawn can assume <i>gaseous form</i> at will as the spell (caster level 6th), but it can remain gaseous
      indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire-spawn--combat--spider-climb-ex">Spider Climb (Ex):</strong> A vampire spawn can climb sheer
      surfaces as though with a <i>spider climb</i> spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vampire-spawn--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> Vampire spawn have a +4 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide,
      Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks.
    </p>
    <h3 id="vampire-spawn--vampire-spawn-weaknesses">Vampire Spawn Weaknesses</h3>
    <p>
      Vampire spawn are vulnerable to all attacks and effects that repel or slay vampires. For details, see the Vampire
      entry.

      A vargouille is slightly larger than a human head, about 18 inches high, with a wingspan of 4 feet. It weighs
      about 10 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>Vargouilles speak Infernal.</p>
    <h3 id="vargouille--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Vargouilles attack by biting with their jagged teeth. Their special attacks make them even more dangerous. A
      vargouille’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of
      overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vargouille--combat--shriek-su">Shriek (Su):</strong> Instead of biting, a vargouille can open its
      distended mouth and let out a terrible shriek. Those within 60 feet (except other vargouilles) who hear the shriek
      and can clearly see the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed with fear for 2d4 rounds
      or until the monster attacks them, goes out of range, or leaves their sight. A paralyzed creature is susceptible
      to the vargouille’s kiss (see below). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same
      vargouille’s shriek for 24 hours. The shriek is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Constitution-based
      and includes a +1 racial bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vargouille--combat--kiss-su">Kiss (Su):</strong> A vargouille can kiss a paralyzed target with a
      successful melee touch attack. An affected opponent must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or begin a terrible
      transformation that turns the creature into a vargouille within 24 hours (and often much sooner; roll 1d6
      separately for each phase of the transformation).
    </p>
    <p>
      First, over a period of 1d6 hours, all the victim’s hair falls out. Within another 1d6 hours thereafter, the ears
      grow into leathery wings, tentacles sprout on the chin and scalp, and the teeth become long, pointed fangs. During
      the next 1d6 hours, the victim takes Intelligence drain and Charisma drain equal to 1 point per hour (to a minimum
      of 3). The transformation is complete 1d6 hours later, when the head breaks free of the body (which promptly dies)
      and becomes a vargouille. This transformation is interrupted by sunlight, and even a
      <i>daylight</i> spell can delay death, but to reverse the transformation requires <i>remove disease</i>. The save
      DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="vargouille--combat--poison-ex">Poison (Ex):</strong> Injury, Fortitude DC 12 or be unable to heal the
      vargouille’s bite damage naturally or magically. A <i>neutralize poison</i> or <i>heal</i> spell removes the
      effect, while <i>delay poison</i> allows magical healing. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1
      racial bonus.

      Will-o’-wisps can be yellow, white, green, or blue. They are easily mistaken for lanterns, especially in the foggy
      marshes and swamps where they reside. A will-o’-wisp’s body is a globe of spongy material about 1 foot across and
      weighing about 3 pounds, and its glowing body sheds as much light as a torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will-o’-wisps speak Common and Auran. They have no vocal apparatus but can vibrate to create a voice with a
      ghostly sound.
    </p>
    <h3 id="will-o-wisp--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Will-o’-wisps usually avoid combat. They prefer to confuse and bewilder adventurers, luring them into morasses or
      other hazardous places. When they are forced to fight, they loose small electrical shocks, which act as melee
      touch attacks.

      <strong id="will-o-wisp--combat--natural-invisibility-ex">Natural Invisibility (Ex):</strong> A startled or

      appear armored or outfitted with weapons. This appearance does not affect the creature’s AC or combat abilities
      but only reflects the shape it had in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wraith is about as tall as a human, while a dread wraith is roughly the size of an ogre. Since both are
      incorporeal, they are weightless.
    </p>
    <p>Wraiths speak Common and Infernal.</p>
    <h3 id="wraith--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>Both the wraith and the dread wraith share the following abilities.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="wraith--combat--unnatural-aura-su">Unnatural Aura (Su):</strong> Animals, whether wild or
      domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a wraith at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly
      approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that
      range.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="wraith--combat--daylight-powerlessness-ex">Daylight Powerlessness (Ex):</strong> Wraiths are utterly
      powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a <i>daylight</i> spell) and flee from it.
    </p>
    <h3 id="wraith--wraith">Wraith</h3>
    <p>
      <strong id="wraith--wraith--constitution-drain-su">Constitution Drain (Su):</strong> Living creatures hit by a
      wraith’s incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain.
      The save DC is Charisma-based. On each such successful attack, the wraith gains 5 temporary hit points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="wraith--wraith--create-spawn-su">Create Spawn (Su):</strong> Any humanoid slain by a wraith becomes a
      wraith in 1d4 rounds. Its body remains intact and inanimate, but its spirit is torn free from its corpse and
      transformed. Spawn are under the command of the wraith that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They
      do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
    </p>
    <h3 id="wraith--dread-wraith">Dread Wraith</h3>
    <p>
      The oldest and most malevolent wraiths lurk in the depths of forgotten temples and other forsaken places. They can
      sense the approach of living creatures, and hunger for them. Despite its size, the dread wraith possesses
      unearthly quickness, and makes use of its Spring Attack feat and natural reach to strike with deadly effect and
      melt back into the shadows—or the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="wraith--dread-wraith--lifesense-su">Lifesense (Su):</strong> A dread wraith notices and locates living
      creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. It also senses the strength of their
      life force automatically, as if it had cast
      <i>deathwatch.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="wraith--dread-wraith--constitution-drain-su">Constitution Drain (Su):</strong> Living creatures hit by
      a dread wraith’s incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of
      Constitution drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. On each such successful attack, the dread wraith gains 5
      temporary hit points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="wraith--dread-wraith--create-spawn-su">Create Spawn (Su):</strong> Any humanoid slain by a dread
      wraith becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. Its body remains intact and inanimate, but its spirit is torn free from its
      corpse and transformed. Spawn are under the command of the wraith that created them and remain enslaved until its
      death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

      A distant cousin to the true dragons, the wyvern is a huge flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wyvern’s body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to gray; half that length is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet.
      A wyvern weighs about one ton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wyverns speak Draconic, but usually don’t bother with anything more elaborate than a loud hiss or a deep-throated
      growl much like that of a bull alligator.
    </p>
    <h3 id="wyvern--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Wyverns are rather stupid but always aggressive: They attack nearly anything that isn’t obviously more powerful
      than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, snatching the opponent with its talons and stinging it to death. A
      wyvern can slash with its talons only when making a flyby attack.

    <p>A xill stands 4 to 5 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds. Xills speak Infernal.</p>
    <h3 id="xill--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Xills are dangerous opponents, attacking with all four limbs. More civilized ones use weapons, usually fighting
      with two at a time so as to leave two claws free for grab attacks. Xills typically lie in wait on the Ethereal
      Plane for suitable prey to happen by, then ambush it using their planewalk ability. They make full use of their
      Tumble skill in combat: Usually, one or two distract physically powerful enemies by attacking, then assuming a
      defensive stance while their fellows maneuver to advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="xill--combat--implant-ex">Implant (Ex):</strong> As a standard action, a xill can lay eggs inside a
      paralyzed creature. The young emerge about 90 days later, literally devouring the host from inside. A
      <i>remove disease</i> spell rids a victim of the egg, as does a DC 25 Heal check. If the check fails, the healer
      can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="xill--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a xill must hit with
      one or more claw attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
      opportunity. It receives a +2 bonus on the grapple check for each claw that hits. If it wins the grapple check and
      maintains the hold in the next round, it automatically bites the foe at that time. The bite deals no damage but
      injects a paralyzing venom.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="xill--combat--paralysis-ex">Paralysis (Ex):</strong> Those bitten by a xill must succeed on a DC 14
      Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="xill--combat--planewalk-su">Planewalk (Su):</strong> These planar travelers like to slip between the
      folds of space to attack enemies as though from thin air. They can cross from the Ethereal Plane with a move
      action but take 2 rounds to cross back, during which time they are immobile. As a xill fades away, it becomes
      harder to hit: Opponents have a 20% miss chance in
    </p>
    <p>
      the first round and a 50% miss chance in the second. A xill can planewalk with a willing or helpless creature.

    <p>
      Xorns do not attack fleshly beings except to defend themselves or their property, since they cannot digest meat.
      Xorns are indifferent to creatures of the Material Plane—with the sole exception of anyone carrying a significant
      amount of precious metals or minerals, which xorns eat. They can smell food up to 20 feet away. A xorn can be
      quite aggressive when seeking food, especially on the Material Plane, where such sustenance is harder to find than
      it is on its native plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      A xorn’s favorite mode of attack is to wait just beneath a stone surface until a foe comes within reach, then
      emerge suddenly. Groups of xorns often send one of their number to the surface to negotiate for food while the
      remainder position themselves for a surprise attack.

      <strong id="xorn--combat--earth-glide-ex">Earth Glide (Ex):</strong> A xorn can glide through stone, dirt, or
      almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind
      no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A <i>move earth</i> spell cast on
      an area containing a burrowing xorn flings the xorn back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it
      succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
