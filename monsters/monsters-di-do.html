    <p>A digester stands about 5 feet tall and is 7 feet long from snout to tail. It weighs about 350 pounds,</p>
    <h3 id="digester--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A digester is a hunting and eating machine. When it is not hungry (which is rarely), it lies low and avoids most
      other creatures. When hunting, it looks about for a likely target, then charges forth and delivers a gout of acid.
      If the initial attack is insufficient to kill the prey, the digester attacks with its hind feet until it can spray
      acid again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="digester--combat--acid-spray-ex">Acid Spray (Ex):</strong> A digester can spray acid in a 20-foot
      cone, dealing 4d8 points of damage to everything in the area. Once a digester uses this ability, it can’t use it
      again until 1d4 rounds later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creature can also produce a concentrated stream of acid that deals 8d8 points of damage to a single target
      within 5 feet. In either case, a DC 17 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="digester--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> A digester’s coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus on Hide
      checks. It also has a +4 racial bonus on Jump checks.
    </p>
    <h2 id="dinosaur">Dinosaur</h2>
    <p>
      Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Bigger varieties have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have more
      colorful markings. Most dinosaurs have a pebbly skin texture.
    </p>
    <h3 id="dinosaur--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Dinosaurs take full advantage of their size and speed. The swift carnivores stalk prey, staying hidden in cover
      until they can get into charge range and rush to the attack. Herbivores frequently overrun and trample their
      opponents.

      A deinonychus is bright green along its back and flanks, with a much lighter shade of the same color on its
      underside. The body has darker spots or stripes. Its tail extends straight out behind itself, held aloft by an
      intricate structure of bony supports, thus allowing its weight to be carried entirely by the back legs. It weighs
      about 600 pounds.
    </p>
    <h4 id="dinosaur--deinonychus--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      A deinonychus uses a combination of speed, grasping forearms, large teeth, and hind legs with ripping talons. It
      hunts by running at prey, leaping, and ripping with its rear talons as it claws and bites. The talons count as one
      attack. A deinonychus has a relatively large brain for a dinosaur, and its pack hunts with cunning tactics.

      Though it resides primarily in the water, an elasmosaurus only breathes air. An elasmosaurus has a total length of
      some 30 feet, including a tail half as long as its entire body, and weighs about 5,000 pounds. Observers who see
      only its head or tail might easily mistake it for a massive snake.
    </p>
    <h4 id="dinosaur--elasmosaurus--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      An elasmosaurus is aggressive and attacks anything it notices. The creature is strong, fast, and highly
      maneuverable, able to turn quickly and lunge at prey. When hunting, it travels with its head out of the water,
      snapping down quickly to seize prey.

      Despite its enormous size and 6-ton weight, a tyrannosaurus is a swift runner. Its head is nearly 6 feet long, and

      Doppelgangers are strange beings that are able to take on the shapes of those they encounter. In its natural form,
      the creature looks more or less humanoid, but slender and frail, with gangly limbs and half-formed features. The
      flesh is pale and hairless. Its large, bulging eyes are yellow with slitted pupils. A doppelganger’s appearance is
      deceiving even when it’s in its true form. A doppelganger is hardy, with a natural agility not in keeping with its
      frail appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doppelgangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid
      society. Although not usually evil, they are interested only in themselves and regard all others as playthings to
      be manipulated and deceived.
    </p>
    <p>It is natural form a doppelganger is about 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.</p>
    <h3 id="doppelganger--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      When in its natural form, a doppelganger strikes with its powerful fists. In the shape of a warrior or some other
      armed person, it attacks with whatever weapon is appropriate. In such cases, it uses its detect thoughts ability
      to employ the same tactics and strategies as the person it is impersonating.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="doppelganger--combat--detect-thoughts-su">Detect Thoughts (Su):</strong> A doppelganger can
      continuously use detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 13 negates). It can suppress or resume

      remain in its humanoid form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but a
      doppelganger reverts to its natural form when killed. A <i>true seeing</i> spell or ability reveals its natural
      form.
