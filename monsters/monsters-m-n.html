      Magmins are small, human-shaped beings from the Elemental Plane of Fire that radiate intense heat and are wreathed
      in an aura of searing flames. A typical magmin is 4 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>Magmins speak Ignan.</p>
    <h3 id="magmin--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Although small, magmins are dangerous opponents. Their touch is effective against those who lack protection or
      immunity from heat and flames, but if faced with opponents who have immunity to fire, magmins rely on their slam
      attack. In any case, magmins are not valiant fighters. They usually flee if injured, although often only far
      enough to set up a fiery ambush for their enemies.
    </p>
    <p>A magmin’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="magmin--combat--combustion-ex">Combustion (Ex):</strong> Anyone a magmin touches must succeed on a DC
      12 Reflex save or take an extra 1d8 points of fire damage as clothes ignite or armor becomes searing hot. The
      damage continues for another 1d4+2 rounds after the magmin’s last successful attack. Magmins can also ignite
      flammable materials with a touch. The save DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="magmin--combat--fiery-aura-ex">Fiery Aura (Ex):</strong> Anyone within 20 feet of a magmin must
      succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of heat damage per round from the intense heat. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="magmin--combat--melt-weapons-ex">Melt Weapons (Ex):</strong> Any metal weapon that strikes a magmin
      must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or melt away into slag. The save DC is Constitution-based.

      A medusa is indistinguishable from a normal human at distances greater than 30 feet (or closer, if its face is
      concealed). The creature often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding its face behind a hood or veil.

    <p>A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as a human.</p>
    <p>Medusas speak Common.</p>
    <h3 id="medusa--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A medusa tries to disguise its true nature until the intended victim is within range of its petrifying gaze, using
      subterfuge and bluffing games to convince the target that there is no danger. It uses normal weapons to attack
      those who avert their eyes or survive its gaze, while its poisonous snakes strike at adjacent opponents.

    </p>
    <h3 id="mephit--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon, the nature and effects of which vary from

      A mimic can have almost any dimensions, but usually is not more than 10 feet long. A typical mimic has a volume of
      150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet) and weighs about 4,500 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>Mimics speak Common.</p>
    <h3 id="mimic--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A mimic often surprises an unsuspecting adventurer, lashing out with a heavy pseudopod. The creature does not
      necessarily fight to the death if it can succeed in extorting treasure or food from a party.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="mimic--combat--adhesive-ex">Adhesive (Ex):</strong> A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a
      powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic automatically
      grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the mimic is alive
      without removing the adhesive first.
    </p>
    <p>
      A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. A
      successful DC 16 Strength check is needed to pry it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic still can grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive
      at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="mimic--combat--crush-ex">Crush (Ex):</strong> A mimic deals 1d8+4 points of damage with a successful
      grapple check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="mimic--combat--mimic-shape-ex">Mimic Shape (Ex):</strong> A mimic can assume the general shape of any
      object that fills roughly 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet), such as a massive chest, a stout bed, or a
      wide door frame. The creature cannot substantially alter its size, though. A mimic’s body is hard and has a rough
      texture, no matter what appearance it might present. Anyone who examines the mimic can detect the ruse with a
      successful Spot check opposed by the mimic’s Disguise check. Of course, by this time it is generally far too late.

    <h3 id="minotaur--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>Minotaurs prefer melee combat, where their great strength serves them well.</p>

      battle by charging at an opponent, lowering its head to bring its mighty horns into play. In addition to the
      normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this allows the beast to make a single gore attack with a +9 attack bonus
      that deals 4d6+6 points of damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="minotaur--combat--natural-cunning-ex">Natural Cunning (Ex):</strong> Although minotaurs are not
      especially intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability. This gives them immunity to
      <i>maze</i> spells, prevents them from ever becoming lost, and enables them to track enemies. Further, they are
      never caught flat-footed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="minotaur--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> Minotaurs have a +4 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and

      checks, lifting and carrying limits double those of Medium characters.

    <p>—A minotaur’s base land speed is 30 feet.</p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>
      —Racial Hit Dice: A minotaur begins with six levels of monstrous humanoid, which provide 6d8 Hit Dice, a base
      attack bonus of +6, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +2, Ref +5, and Will +5.

    <p>
      —Racial Skills: A minotaur’s monstrous humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 9 x (2 + Int modifier,
      minimum 1). Its class skills are Intimidate, Jump, Listen, Search, and Spot. Minotaurs have a +4 racial bonus on
      Search, Spot, and Listen checks.

      Like zombies, mohrgs attack by slamming enemies with their fists. They often catch opponents flat-footed, for they

      <strong id="mohrg--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a mohrg must hit a

      minutes. The save DC is Charisma-based.

    <p>
      Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or is cured as
      described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mummy rot is a powerful curse, not a natural disease. A character attempting to cast any conjuration (healing)
      spell on a creature afflicted with mummy rot must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell has no
      effect on the afflicted character.
    </p>
    <p>
      To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must first be broken with
      <i>break enchantment</i> or <i>remove curse</i> (requiring a DC 20 caster level check for either spell), after
      which a caster level check is no longer necessary to cast healing spells on the victim, and the mummy rot can be
      magically cured as any normal disease.

      An afflicted creature who dies of mummy rot shrivels away into sand and dust that blow away into nothing at the

      Unusually powerful or evil individuals preserved as mummies sometimes rise as greater mummies after death. A mummy
      lord resembles its lesser fellows, but often wears or carries equipment it used in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mummy lords are often potent spellcasters. They are found as guardians of the tombs of high lords, priests, and
      mages. Most are sworn to defend for eternity the resting place of those whom they served in life, but in some
      cases a mummy lord’s unliving state is the result of a terrible curse or rite designed to punish treason,
      infidelity, or crimes of an even more abhorrent nature. A mummy lord of this sort is usually imprisoned in a tomb
      that is never meant to be opened again.

    <p>
      All nagas have long, snakelike bodies covered with glistening scales, and more or less human faces. They range in
      length from 10 to 20 feet and weigh from 200 to 500 pounds. The eyes of a naga are bright and intelligent, burning
      with an almost hypnotic inner light.
    </p>
    <h3 id="naga--combat">Combat</h3>

      Nagas favor spells over other forms of combat. Because they are almost always found in the lairs they guard and

      sleeper suffers from tormenting dreams and takes 1 point of Constitution drain upon awakening. Only another

      All night hags carry a periapt known as a <i>heartstone,</i> which instantly cures any disease contracted by the
      holder. In addition, a <i>heartstone</i> provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is
      included in the statistics block). A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use <i>etherealness</i> until
      it can manufacture another (which takes one month). Creatures other than the hag can benefit from the
      <i>heartstone</i>’s powers, but the periapt shatters after ten uses (any disease cured or saving throw affected
    </p>
    <p>
      counts as a use) and it does not bestow <i>etherealness</i> to a bearer that is not a night hag. If sold, an
      intact <i>heartstone</i> brings 1,800 gp.

    <p>A nightmare is about the size of a light war horse.</p>
    <h3 id="nightmare--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A nightmare can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also fight unless he or she succeeds on a Ride
      check.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nightmare’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of
      overcoming damage reduction.

      sets combustible materials alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="nightmare--combat--smoke-su">Smoke (Su):</strong> During the excitement of battle, a nightmare snorts
      and neighs with rage. This snorting fills a 15-foot cone with a hot, sulfurous smoke that chokes and blinds
      opponents. Anyone in the cone must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take a –2 penalty on all attack and damage
      rolls until 1d6 minutes after leaving the cone. The cone lasts 1 round, and the nightmare uses it once as a free
      action during its turn each round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the smoke it gives off, a nightmare has concealment against creatures 5 feet away and total concealment
      against creatures 10 feet or farther away. The smoke does not obscure the nightmare’s vision at all.

      The cauchemar is a horrible, especially malevolent version of a nightmare. The sight of one of these great horrors

    <h2 id="nightshade">Nightshade</h2>
    <p>Nightshades are powerful undead composed of equal parts darkness and absolute evil.</p>
    <p>
      Nightshades can read and understand all forms of communication; however, they communicate with others by
      telepathy.
    </p>
    <h3 id="nightshade--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Each of the three known varieties of nightshade is a terrible creature with unique powers and abilities. Their
      tactics vary according to their abilities, but they all make liberal use of <i>haste</i>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="nightshade--nightshade-abilities">Nightshade Abilities</h3>
    <p>All nightshades have the following special abilities.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="nightshade--nightshade-abilities--aversion-to-daylight-ex">Aversion to Daylight (Ex):</strong> If
      exposed to natural daylight (not merely a <i>daylight</i> spell), nightshades take a –4 penalty on all attack
      rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="nightshade--nightshade-abilities--desecrating-aura-su">Desecrating Aura (Su):</strong> All nightshades
      give off a 20-footradius emanation of utter desecration, imbuing their surroundings with negative energy. This
      ability works much like a <i>desecrate</i> spell, except that the nightshade’s evil is so great that it is treated
      as the shrine of an evil power. All undead within 20 feet of the nightshade (including the creature itself ) gain
      a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and +2 hit points per HD. (The nightshade Hit
      Dice, attack, and save entries given here include these profane bonuses.) Charisma checks made to turn undead
      within this area take a –6 penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nightshade’s desecrating aura cannot be dispelled except by a
      <i>dispel evil</i> spell or similar effect. If the effect is dispelled, the nightshade can resume it as a free
      action on its next turn. Its desecrating aura is suppressed if a nightshade enters a <i>consecrated</i> or
      <i>hallowed</i> area, but the nightshade’s presence also suppresses the <i>consecrated</i> or
      <i>hallowed</i> effect for as long as it remains in the area.

      gizzard and is subject to the creature’s energy drain. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light
      slashing or piercing weapon to deal 35 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 21). Once the creature exits, muscular
      action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A nightcrawler’s interior can hold 2
