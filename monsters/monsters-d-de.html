    <p>
      The darkmantle hangs from a ceiling by a muscular “foot” at the top of its body. It can look like a stalactite, by
      holding its tentacles stiffly under itself, or like a lump of rock, spreading its tentacles so the membrane
      between them covers its body. Its shell and skin usually resemble limestone, but a darkmantle can change its color
      to match almost any type of stony background.
    </p>
    <p>
      A darkmantle is about 4 feet long from the tips of its tentacles to the top of its head. It weighs about 30
      pounds.
    </p>
    <h3 id="darkmantle--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A darkmantle attacks by dropping onto its prey and wrapping its tentacles around the opponent’s head. Once
      attached, it squeezes and tries to suffocate the foe. A darkmantle that misses its initial attack often flies up
      and tries to drop on the opponent again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="darkmantle--combat--darkness-su">Darkness (Su):</strong> Once per day a darkmantle can cause darkness
      as the <i>darkness</i> spell (caster level 5th). It most often uses this ability just before attacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="darkmantle--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a darkmantle
      must hit a Large or smaller creature with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
      without provoking an attack of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>If it wins the grapple check, it attaches to the opponent’s head and can constrict.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="darkmantle--combat--constrict-ex">Constrict (Ex):</strong> A darkmantle deals 1d4+4 points of damage
      with a successful grapple check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="darkmantle--combat--blindsight-ex">Blindsight (Ex):</strong> A darkmantle can “see” by emitting
      high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allows it to ascertain objects and creatures within
      90 feet. A <i>silence</i> spell negates this ability and effectively blinds the darkmantle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="darkmantle--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> A darkmantle has a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
      checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated. The creature’s variable coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus
      on Hide checks.

    <p>A delver is about 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. It weighs about 6,000 pounds.</p>
    <p>Delvers speak Terran and Undercommon.</p>
    <h3 id="delver--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A delver prefers to fight from its tunnel, which it uses to protect its flanks while lashing out with its
      flippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A delver expecting trouble may honeycomb an area with tunnels, leaving most closed with layers of stone 1 or 2
      inches thick.
    </p>
    <p>The delver can quickly dissolve the stone cover and pop up to attack unexpectedly.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="delver--combat--corrosive-slime-ex">Corrosive Slime (Ex):</strong> A delver produces a mucuslike slime
      that contains a highly corrosive substance. The slime is particularly effective against stone. A delver’s mere
      touch deals 2d6 points of acid damage to organic creatures or objects. Against metallic creatures or objects, a
      delver’s slime deals 4d8 points of damage, and against stony creatures (including earth elementals) or objects it
      deals 8d10 points of damage. A slam attack by a delver leaves a patch of slime that deals 2d6 points of damage on
      contact and another 2d6 points of damage in each of the next 2 rounds. A large quantity (at least a quart) of
      water or weak acid, such as vinegar, washes off the slime. An opponent’s armor and clothing dissolve and become
      useless immediately unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. Weapons that strike a delver also dissolve
      immediately unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. A creature attacking a delver with natural weapons
      takes damage from its slime each time an attack hits unless the creature succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. These
      save DCs are Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="delver--combat--stone-shape-ex">Stone Shape (Ex):</strong> A delver can alter its slime to temporarily
      soften stone instead of dissolving it. Once every 10 minutes, a delver can soften and shape up to 25 cubic feet of
      stone, as a <i>stone shape</i> spell (caster level 15th).
    </p>
    <h2 id="demon">Demon</h2>
    <p>
      Demons are a race of creatures native to chaotic evil-aligned planes. They are ferocity personified and will
      attack any creature just for the sheer fun of it—even other demons.
    </p>
    <p>Demon Traits: Most demons possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>—Immunity to electricity and poison.</p>
    <p>—Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10.</p>
    <p>
      —<i>Summon</i> (Sp): Many demons share the ability to summon others of their kind (the success chance and type of
      demon summoned are noted in each monster description). Demons are often reluctant to use this power until in
      obvious peril or extreme circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>—Telepathy.</p>
    <p>Except where otherwise noted, demons speak Abyssal, Celestial, and Draconic.</p>

    <p>A babau is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 140 pounds.</p>
    <h4 id="demon--babau--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Babaus are sneaky and sly. They attack the most powerful foe first, hoping to eliminate the true threats quickly
      and then toy with the rest. When ambushing their opponents, they make excellent use of the combination of multiple
      attacks and sneak attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A babau’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for
      the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="demon--babau--combat--sneak-attack-ex">Sneak Attack (Ex):</strong> A babau can make a sneak attack
      like a rogue, dealing an extra 2d6 points of damage whenever a foe is denied his or her Dexterity bonus, or when
      the babau is flanking.

      hardness does not reduce this damage. A magic weapon may attempt a DC 18 Reflex save to avoid taking this damage.
      A creature who strikes the babau with an unarmed attack, unarmed strike, touch spell, or natural weapon takes this
      damage as well but can negate the damage with a DC 18 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

    <p>A balor stands about 12 feet tall. Its skin is usually dark red. It weighs about 4,500 pounds.</p>
    <h4 id="demon--balor--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Balors love to join battle armed with their swords and whips. If they face stiff resistance, they may teleport
      away to loose a few spell-like effects at the foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      A balor’s <i>+1 flaming whip</i> is a long, flexible weapon with many tails tipped with hooks, spikes, and balls.
      The weapon deals bludgeoning and slashing damage, in addition to fire damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A balor’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for
      the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

      <strong id="demon--balor--combat--death-throes-ex">Death Throes (Ex):</strong>When killed, a balor explodes in a
      blinding flash of light that deals 100 points of damage to anything within 100 feet (Reflex DC 30 half ). This
      explosion automatically destroys any weapons the balor is holding. The save DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="demon--balor--combat--entangle-ex">Entangle (Ex):</strong> A balor’s <i>+1 flaming whip</i> entangles
      foes much like an attack with a net. The whip has 20 hit points. The whip needs no folding. If it hits, the target
      and the balor immediately make opposed Strength checks; if the balor wins, it drags the target against its flaming
      body (see below). The target remains anchored against the balor’s body until it escapes the whip.

      Bebiliths are enormous, predatory, arachnid demons that hunt other demons. A bebilith has a body the size of a
      plow horse, with legs spanning more than 14 feet. It weighs more than two tons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bebiliths understand but do not speak Abyssal. Their telepathy allows them to communicate silently with one
      another.
    </p>
    <h3 id="demon--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A bebilith attacks any creature it sees. It usually picks one target and concentrates its attacks on that
      opponent, using its webs to isolate the target from its comrades. Should the bebilith become overwhelmed by
      tougher opponents, it often attempts to bite one or more of its victims and retreats, allowing its poison to do
      its work.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bebilith’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned
      for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="demon--combat--poison-ex">Poison (Ex):</strong> Injury, Fortitude DC 24, initial damage 1d6 Con,
      secondary damage 2d6 Con. Bebilith venom is highly perishable, losing its potency and becoming inert,
      foul-smelling goo almost as soon as it comes into contact with air. The save DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="demon--combat--rend-armor-ex">Rend Armor (Ex):</strong> If a bebilith hits with both claw attacks, it
      pulls apart any armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 4d6+18 points of damage to the opponent’s armor.
      Creatures not wearing armor are unaffected by this special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed.
      Damaged armor may be repaired with a successful Craft (armorsmithing) check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="demon--combat--web-ex">Web (Ex):</strong> A bebilith can throw a web up to four times per day. This is
      similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 30 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet. This attack
      is effective against targets of up to Gargantuan size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      An entangled creature can escape with a DC 24 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a DC 24 Strength check.
      The check DCs are Constitution-based. The web has 14 hit points and hardness 0. There is a 75% chance that the
      webbing will not burn if any sort of fire is applied to it (check each round).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="demon--combat--plane-shift-su">Plane Shift (Su):</strong> This ability affects only the bebilith. It
      is otherwise similar to the spell (caster level 12th).
    </p>

      <strong id="demon--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> A bebilith has mottled coloration that gives it a +8 racial
      bonus on Hide checks.

      Dretches are slow, stupid, and not very effective combatants. In one-on-one combat, they rely on their damage

      other dretches to improve the odds in battle. They flee at the first sign of adversity unless more powerful demons
      are present to intimidate them into fighting. Dretches’ fear of their greater kin is stronger then even their fear

      Like succubi, glabrezu tempt victims into ruin, but they lure their prey with power or wealth rather than passion.

      Glabrezu prefer subterfuge to combat. However, if their attempts to entice or deceive fail, these enormous demons

      foes with <i>chaos hammer</i> or <i>unholy blight.</i>

      A glabrezu’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned

      Once per month, a glabrezu can fulfill a <i>wish</i> for a mortal humanoid. The demon can use this ability to

      When fulfilling their duties in the underworld, nalfeshnees usually disdain combat as being beneath them. Given
      the opportunity, they succumb to blood lust and do battle. They disable opponents with their smite ability and
      slaughter them while they can’t fight back.

      A nalfeshnee’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned

      a nimbus of unholy light. When the demon triggers the ability, rainbow-colored beams play around its body. One
      round later they burst in a 60-foot radius. Any creature within this area must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be
      dazed for 1d10 rounds as visions of its worst fears hound it. The creature receives its full Dexterity and shield
      bonuses to AC if attacked but can take no actions. Other demons are immune to this effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.

      assume only one or two forms no larger than Medium. Common forms include bat, monstrous centipede, toad, and wolf.
      A quasit in alternate form loses its poison attack.

      A retriever specializes in recovering lost or desired objects, runaway slaves, and enemies and bringing them back

      <strong id="demon--retriever--combat--eye-rays-su">Eye Rays (Su):</strong> A retriever’s eyes can produce four
      different magical rays with a range of 100 feet. Each round, it can fire one ray as a free action. A particular
      ray is usable only once every 4 rounds. A retriever can fire an eye ray in the same round that it makes physical
      attacks. The save DC for all rays is 18. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

      The being giving the order must have seen (or must have an item belonging to) the creature to be found, or must

    <p>
      <strong id="demon--retriever--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a
      retriever must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking
      an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and grips the opponent fast in its
      mouth. This is the method by which it usually “retrieves” things.

    <p>A succubus is 6 feet tall in its natural form and weighs about 125 pounds.</p>
    <h4 id="demon--succubus--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Succubi are not warriors. They flee combat whenever they can. If forced to fight, they can attack with their
      claws, but they prefer to turn foes against one another. Succubi use their <i>polymorph</i> ability to assume
      humanoid guise, and can maintain this deception indefinitely. Their preferred tactic when dealing with heroes is
      to feign friendship and create an opportunity to be alone with one of them, whereupon the succubus applies her
      life-draining kiss. Succubi are not above taking on the role of a damsel in distress when encountered within a
      dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A succubus’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned
      for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

      <strong id="demon--succubus--combat--energy-drain-su">Energy Drain (Su):</strong> A succubus drains energy from a
      mortal it lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the victim. If the target is not willing
      to be kissed, the succubus must start a grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. The succubus’s kiss or
      embrace bestows one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of a <i>suggestion</i> spell, asking the victim
      to accept another kiss from the succubus. The victim must succeed on a DC 21 Will save to negate the effect of the
      <i>suggestion</i>. The DC is 21 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are
      Charisma-based.

    <p>A vrock is about 8 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds.</p>
    <h4 id="demon--vrock--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Vrocks are vicious fighters who like to fly down into the enemy and cause as much damage as possible. They prance
      about in battle, taking briefly to the air and bringing their clawed feet into play. Despite their advantage in
      mobility, the vrocks’ deep love of battle frequently leads them into melee combats against heavy odds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vrock’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for
      the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

    <p>
      <strong id="demon--vrock--combat--dance-of-ruin-su">Dance of Ruin (Su):</strong> To use this ability, a group of
      at least three vrocks must join hands in a circle, dancing wildly and chanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of 3 rounds of dancing, a wave of crackling energy flashes outward in a 100-foot radius. All creatures
      except for demons within the radius take 20d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 18 half ). Stunning, paralyzing, or
      slaying one of the vrocks stops the dance. The save DC is Charisma-based.

    <p>
      <strong id="demon--vrock--combat--spores-ex">Spores (Ex):</strong> A vrock can release masses of spores from its
      body once every 3 rounds as a free action. The spores automatically deal 1d8 points of damage to all creatures
      adjacent to the vrock. They then penetrate the skin and grow, dealing an additional 1d4 points of damage each
      round for 10 rounds. At the end of this time, the victim is covered with a tangle of viny growths. (The vines are
      harmless and wither away in 1d4 days.) A <i>delay poison</i> spell stops the spores’ growth for its duration.
      <i>Bless, neutralize poison,</i> or <i>remove disease</i> kills the spores, as does sprinkling the victim with a
      vial of holy water.

      Derro are afflicted by a form of racial madness, which most often manifests as delusions of grandeur coupled with
      an overpowering urge to inflict torment on other creatures. Derro are capable of holding their murderous impulses
      in check for short periods of time in order to cooperate with creatures of other races, but such arrangements
      rarely last more than a few weeks. Of course, no derro is capable of recognizing that he is out of his mind.

    <p>
      Derro are stealthy and bloodthirsty. They like to carefully arrange cruel traps and deadly ambushes, and strike

    <p>
      *The racial madness of the derro provides a +6 bonus to their Charisma scores and a –6 penalty to their Wisdom

      The dungeon-dwelling destrachan looks like some bizarre, nonintelligent beast, but it’s an incredibly evil and
      crafty sadist. A destrachan has a pair of complex, three-part ears that it can adjust to be more or less sensitive
      to various sounds. It is blind, yet hunts with a sense of hearing more precise than most creatures’ sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      From its tubular mouth a destrachan emits carefully focused harmonics, producing sonic energy so powerful it can
      shatter a stone wall. So skilled is a destrachan at controlling the sounds it emits that it can choose what type

    <p>A destrachan is about 10 feet long from its mouth to the tip of the tail and weighs about 4,000 pounds.</p>

    <h3 id="destrachan--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A destrachan uses its claws only as a last resort or to finish off foes weakened by its sonic attacks. It often
      enters battle with surprise if possible. It first focuses on destroying metal armor and weapons and then changes
      to harmonics that disrupt flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="destrachan--combat--destructive-harmonics-su">Destructive Harmonics (Su):</strong> A destrachan can
      blast sonic energy in a cone up to 80 feet long. It can also use this attack to affect any creatures or objects
      within a 30-foot radius. It can tune the harmonics of this destructive power to affect different types of targets.
      All save DCs are Charisma-based.

    <p>
      <em id="destrachan--combat--destructive-harmonics-su--nerves">Nerves:</em> A destrachan can focus its harmonics to
      knock out foes rather than slay them. This attack deals 6d6 points of nonlethal damage to all within the area
      (Reflex DC 15 half ).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="destrachan--combat--destructive-harmonics-su--material">Material:</em> When using this form of harmonics,
      a destrachan chooses wood, stone, metal, or glass. All objects made of that material within the area must succeed
      on a DC 15 Fortitude save or shatter. Objects (or portions of objects) that have up to 30 hit points are
      potentially affected by this attack.

      affected by loud noises and sonic spells (such as <i>ghost sound</i> or <i>silence</i>), destrachans are less
      vulnerable to sonic attacks (+4 circumstance bonus on all saves) because they can protect their ears. A destrachan
      whose sense of hearing is impaired is effectively blinded, and all targets are treated as having total
      concealment.

    <p>Devils are fiends from lawful evil-aligned planes.</p>
    <p>
      Many devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents
      piecemeal. Devils with spell-like abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as
      possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is
      only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.

      Kytons are humanlike devils, wrapped in chains instead of clothing. A chain devil is 6 feet tall and weighs about
      300 pounds, chains included.
    </p>
    <p>Chain devils speak Infernal and Common.</p>
    <h4 id="devil--chain-devil-kyton--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>A chain devil attacks by flailing away with the spiked chains that serve as its clothing, armor, and weapons.</p>

      A chain devil’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned
      for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="devil--chain-devil-kyton--combat--dancing-chains-su">Dancing Chains (Su):</strong> A chain devil’s
      most awesome attack is its ability to control up to four chains within 20 feet as a standard action, making the
      chains dance or move as it wishes. In addition, a chain devil can increase these chains’ length by up to 15 feet
      and cause them to sprout razor-edged barbs. These chains attack as effectively as the devil itself. If a chain is
      in another creature’s possession, the creature can attempt a DC 15 Will save to break the chain devil’s power over
      that chain. If the save is successful, the kyton cannot attempt to control that particular chain again for 24
      hours or until the chain leaves the creature’s possession. The save DC is Charisma-based.

      enemies. Those who fail their saves take a –2 penalty on attack rolls for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.

      <strong id="devil--chain-devil-kyton--combat--regeneration-ex">Regeneration (Ex):</strong> Chain devils take
      normal damage from silvered weapons, good-aligned weapons, and spells or effects with the good descriptor. A chain
      devil that loses a piece of its body regrows it in 2d6x10 minutes. Holding the severed member against the stump
      enables it to reattach instantly.
    </p>

    <p>A horned devil is 9 feet tall and weighs about 600 pounds.</p>
    <h4 id="devil--horned-devil-cornugon--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Horned devils are bold fighters. They rarely retreat, even against overwhelming odds. They love to fight with
      their spiked chains, usually singling out the most powerful foes to stun and eliminate quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A horned devil’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned
      for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

      affected again by the same horned devil’s aura for 24 hours. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save DC is

      horned devil deals with its tail attack causes a persistent wound. An injured creature loses 2 additional hit
      points each round. The wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. The continuing hit point loss can
      be stopped by a DC 24 Heal check, a <i>cure</i> spell, or a <i>heal</i> spell. However, a character attempting to
      cast a <i>cure</i> spell or a <i>heal</i> spell on a creature damaged by a horned devil’s tail must succeed on a
      DC 24 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character. A successful Heal check
      automatically stops the continuing hit point loss as well as restoring hit points. The check DC is

      Devourers lurk on the Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane, stalking both natives and travelers with equal sadistic
      glee.
    </p>
    <p>A devourer is about 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.</p>
    <p>Devourers speak Common.</p>
    <h3 id="devourer--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Even if it had no special abilities, a devourer would be a terrible opponent, for its bony claws can flay enemies
      alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="devourer--combat--energy-drain-su">Energy Drain (Su):</strong> Living creatures hit by a devourer’s
      claw attack or <i>spectral hand</i> ability gain one negative level. The DC is 19 for the Fortitude save to remove
      a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="devourer--combat--trap-essence-su">Trap Essence (Su):</strong> The devourer is named for its ability
      to consume an enemy’s life essence. To do so, it must forgo its normal melee attacks and make a trap essence
      attack. This requires a normal attack roll but deals no damage. The he save DC is Charisma-based. A slain
      creature’s essence is trapped within the devourer’s ribs, and the tiny figure takes on that victim’s features. The
      trapped essence cannot be raised or resurrected, but a <i>limited wish, miracle,</i> or <i>wish</i> spell frees
      it, as does destroying the devourer. A devourer can hold only one essence at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trapped essence provides a devourer with enough power to use five spell-like abilities for each Hit Die or
      level of the trapped creature. As this energy is expended, the twisted soul fades away until it evaporates
      completely. The trapped essence gains one negative level for every five times the devourer uses one of its
      spell-like abilities. When the essence’s number of negative levels equals the creature’s total Hit Dice or level,
      the essence is destroyed. If an essence is freed, the restored creature must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save for
      each negative level or lose that level permanently.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="devourer--combat--spell-like-abilities">Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> At the start of any encounter,
      the trapped essence within a devourer is assumed to have 3d4+3 levels (enough fuel for thirty to seventy-five
      uses). Once per round, a devourer can use one of the following abilities: <i>confusion</i> (DC 17),
      <i>control undead</i> (DC 20), <i>ghoul touch</i> (DC 15), <i>lesser planar ally, ray of enfeeblement</i> (DC 14),
      <i>spectral hand, suggestion</i> (DC 16), <i>true seeing</i>. Caster level 18th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="devourer--combat--spell-deflection-su">Spell Deflection (Su):</strong> The trapped essence provides a
      measure of magical protection. If any of the following spells are cast at the devourer and overcome its spell
      resistance, they affect the imprisoned essence instead:
      <i
        >banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear,
        geas/quest, holy word, hypnosis, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul,</i
      >
      or any form of charm or compulsion. In many cases, this deflection effectively neutralizes the spell. Some of
      these effects might eliminate the trapped essence, depriving the devourer of its spell-like abilities until it can
      consume another victim.
