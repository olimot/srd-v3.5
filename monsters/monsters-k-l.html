    <p>Kobolds are short, reptilian humanoids with cowardly and sadistic tendencies.</p>
    <p>
      A kobold’s scaly skin ranges from dark rusty brown to a rusty black color. It has glowing red eyes. Its tail is
      nonprehensile. Kobolds wear ragged clothing, favoring red and orange. A kobold is 2 to 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs
      35 to 45 pounds. Kobolds speak Draconic with a voice that sounds like that of a yapping dog.
    </p>
    <h3 id="kobold--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Kobolds like to attack with overwhelming odds—at least two to one—or trickery; should the odds fall below this
      threshold, they usually flee. However, they attack gnomes on sight if their numbers are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      They begin a fight by slinging bullets, closing only when they can see that their foes have been weakened.
      Whenever they can, kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas.
    </p>
    <p>

      Six of the beast’s tentacles are shorter arms about 30 feet long; the remaining two are nearly 60 feet long and
      covered with barbs. Its beaklike mouth is located where the tentacles meet the lower portion of its body.
    </p>
    <p>Krakens speak Common and Aquan.</p>
    <h3 id="kraken--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Krakens strike their opponents with their barbed tentacles, then grab and crush with their arms or drag victims
      into their huge jaws. An opponent can make sunder attempts against a kraken’s tentacles or arms as if they were
      weapons. A kraken’s tentacles have 20 hit points, and its arms have 10 hit points. If a kraken is currently
      grappling a target with one tentacle or arm, it usually uses another limb to make its attack of opportunity
      against the sunder attempt. Severing a kraken’s tentacle or arm deals damage to the kraken equal to half the
      limb’s full normal hit points. A kraken usually withdraws from combat if it loses both tentacles or three of its
      arms. A kraken regrows severed limbs in 1d10+10 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="kraken--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, the kraken must
      hit with an arm or tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an
      attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="kraken--combat--constrict-ex">Constrict (Ex):</strong> A kraken deals automatic arm or tentacle damage
      with a successful grapple check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="kraken--combat--jet-ex">Jet (Ex):</strong> A kraken can jet backward once per round as a full-round
      action, at a speed of 280 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while
      jetting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="kraken--combat--ink-cloud-ex">Ink Cloud (Ex):</strong> A kraken can emit a cloud of jet-black ink in
      an 80-foot spread once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the kraken
      normally uses to escape a fight that is going badly. Creatures within the cloud are considered to be in darkness.

      <strong id="kraken--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> A kraken has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform
      some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or
      endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

      The krenshar is a strange, catlike carnivore with extremely flexible skin on its head. A typical krenshar measures
      4 or 5 feet in length with a long, narrow head. It weighs about 175 pounds.
    </p>
    <h3 id="krenshar--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Krenshars use solitary scouts to drive prey into the waiting clutches of the pride. The scout appears from hiding,
      uses its scare ability, then chases the fleeing target to join the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="krenshar--combat--scare-ex-or-su">Scare (Ex or Su):</strong> As a standard action, a krenshar can pull
      the skin back from its head, revealing the musculature and bony structures of its skull. This alone is usually
      sufficient to scare away foes (treat as a Bluff check with a +3 bonus).
    </p>
    <p>
      Combining this scare ability with a loud screech produces an unsettling effect that works like a
      <i>scare</i> spell from a 3rd-level caster (Will DC 13 partial). A creature that successfully saves cannot be
      affected again by the same krenshar’s scare ability for 24 hours. The shriek does not affect other krenshars. This
      is a supernatural, sonic mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="krenshar--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> Krenshars have a +4 racial bonus on Jump and Move Silently

    <p>A typical lamia is about 8 feet long and weighs about 700 pounds.</p>
    <h3 id="lamia--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Though a lamia is powerful and dangerous in close combat, it has no stomach for a fair fight. It uses its illusion
      abilities to lure heroes into perilous situations, and then uses its Spring Attack feat to bound out of the
      shadows and drain Wisdom from its opponents. When it has sapped the will of its victim, it uses its enchantment
      abilities to beguile and ensnare the unfortunate soul. A lamia forced into physical combat attacks with a dagger
      in one of its human hands and a pair of lion-like claws.

      Leonals like their battles as straightforward as can be. They begin with a roar to put their foes off balance,
      then follow up with a frenzy of claw and bite attacks. They closely coordinate with others in their pride,
      watching one another’s flanks and setting up devastating attacks.
    </p>

      A leonal’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of
      overcoming damage reduction.

      <strong id="leonal--combat--roar-su">Roar (Su):</strong> A leonal can roar up to three times per day. Each roar
      releases a blast in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of a <i>holy word</i> spell and deals an extra 2d6
      points of sonic damage (Fortitude DC 20 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.

      <strong id="leonal--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a leonal must hit
      with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
      opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.

      created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving

      <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect and a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability,</i> both with a radius of 20

      eyes have long ago been lost to decay, but bright pinpoints of crimson light burn on in the empty sockets.
    </p>
    <p>Liches speak Common plus any other languages they knew in life.</p>
    <h3 id="lich--creating-a-lich">Creating a Lich</h3>
    <p>
      “Lich” is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid creature (referred to hereafter as the base
      creature), provided it can create the required phylactery; see The Lich’s Phylactery, below.
    </p>
    <p>A lich has all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--size-and-type">Size and Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead.
      Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--hit-dice">Hit Dice:</strong> Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--armor-class">Armor Class:</strong> A lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the
      base creature’s natural armor bonus, whichever is better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--attack">Attack:</strong> A lich has a touch attack that it can use once per
      round. If the base creature can use weapons, the lich retains this ability. A creature with natural weapons
      retains those natural weapons. A lich fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack or its primary natural
      weapon (if it has any). A lich armed with a weapon uses its touch or a weapon, as it desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--full-attack">Full Attack:</strong> A lich fighting without weapons uses either
      its touch attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any). If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the
      weapon as its primary attack along with a touch as a natural secondary attack, provided it has a way to make that
      attack (either a free hand or a natural weapon that it can use as a secondary attack).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--damage">Damage:</strong> A lich without natural weapons has a touch attack that
      uses negative energy to deal 1d8+5 points of damage to living creatures; a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 lich’s HD +
      lich’s Cha modifier) halves the damage. A lich with natural weapons can use its touch attack or its natural
      weaponry, as it prefers. If it chooses the latter, it deals 1d8+5 points of extra damage on one natural weapon
      attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--special-attacks">Special Attacks:</strong> A lich retains all the base
      creature’s special attacks and gains those described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 lich’s HD + lich’s Cha
      modifier unless otherwise noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="lich--creating-a-lich--special-attacks--fear-aura-su">Fear Aura (Su):</em> Liches are shrouded in a
      dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the lich must
      succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by a <i>fear</i> spell from a sorcerer of the lich’s level. A
      creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same lich’s aura for 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="lich--creating-a-lich--special-attacks--paralyzing-touch-su">Paralyzing Touch (Su):</em> Any living
      creature a lich hits with its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be permanently paralyzed.
      <i>Remove paralysis</i> or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the
      <i>bestow curse</i> spell description).
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Spot check or a DC 15 Heal
      check reveals that the victim is still alive..
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="lich--creating-a-lich--special-attacks--spells">Spells:</em> A lich can cast any spells it could cast
      while alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--special-qualities">Special Qualities:</strong> A lich retains all the base
      creature’s special qualities and gains those described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--turn-resistance-ex">Turn Resistance (Ex):</strong> A lich has +4 turn
      resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--damage-reduction-su">Damage Reduction (Su):</strong> A lich’s undead body is
      tough, giving the creature damage reduction 15/bludgeoning and magic. Its natural weapons are treated as magic
      weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--immunities-ex">Immunities (Ex):</strong> Liches have immunity to cold,
      electricity, polymorph (though they can use polymorph effects on themselves), and mind-affecting attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--abilities">Abilities:</strong> Increase from the base creature as follows: Int
      +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a lich has no Constitution score.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--skills">Skills:</strong> Liches have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move
      Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lich--creating-a-lich--organization">Organization:</strong> Solitary or troupe (1 lich, plus 2–4
      vampires and 5–8 vampire spawn).
    </p>
    <p>

    <h3 id="lich--lich-characters">Lich Characters</h3>
    <p>
      The process of becoming a lich is unspeakably evil and can be undertaken only by a willing character. A lich
      retains all class abilities it had in life.
    </p>
    <h3 id="lich--the-lichs-phylactery">The Lich’s Phylactery</h3>
    <p>
      An integral part of becoming a lich is creating a magic phylactery in which the character stores its life force.
      As a rule, the only way to get rid of a lich for sure is to destroy its phylactery. Unless its phylactery is
      located and destroyed, a lich reappears 1d10 days after its apparent death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each lich must make its own phylactery, which requires the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The character must be able to
      cast spells and have a caster level of 11th or higher. The phylactery costs 120,000 gp and 4,800 XP to create and
      has a caster level equal to that of its creator at the time of creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common form of phylactery is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment on which magical phrases
      have been transcribed. The box is Tiny and has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40.
    </p>
    <p>Other forms of phylacteries can exist, such as rings, amulets, or similar items.</p>

      A typical lillend’s coils are 20 feet long. The creature weighs about 3,800 pounds. A few lillends have male
      torsos.
    </p>
    <p>Lillends speak Celestial, Infernal, Abyssal, and Common.</p>
    <h3 id="lillend--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Lillends are generally peaceful unless they intend vengeance against someone they believe guilty of harming, or
      even threatening, a favored art form, artwork, or artist. Then they become implacable foes. They use their spells
      and spell-like abilities to confuse and weaken opponents before entering combat. A covey of lillends usually
      discusses strategy before a battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lillend’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for
      the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

    <p>
      <strong id="lillend--combat--constrict-ex">Constrict (Ex):</strong> A lillend deals 2d6+5 points of damage with a
      successful grapple check. Constricting uses the entire lower portion of its body, so it cannot take any move
      actions when constricting, though it can still attack with its sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lillend--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a lillend must
      hit with its tail slap attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack
      of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

      A lizardfolk is usually 6 to 7 feet tall with green, gray, or brown scales. Its tail is used for balance and is 3
      to 4 feet long. A lizardfolk can weigh from 200 to 250 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>Lizardfolk speak Draconic.</p>
    <h3 id="lizardfolk--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Lizardfolk fight as unorganized individuals. They prefer frontal assaults and massed rushes, sometimes trying to
      force foes into the water, where the lizardfolk have an advantage. If outnumbered or if their territory is being
      invaded, they set snares, plan ambushes, and make raids to hinder enemy supplies. Advanced tribes use more
      sophisticated tactics and have better traps and ambushes.

      Although humanoid in shape, locathahs are clearly more fish than human. The average locathah stands 5 feet tall
      and weighs 175 pounds. Females and males look very much alike, although the former can be recognized by the two
      ochre stripes marking their egg sacs.
    </p>
    <p>Locathahs speak Aquan.</p>
    <h3 id="locathah--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Any battle with locathahs usually begins with the creatures loosing volleys of bolts from their crossbows;
      underwater, their crossbows have a range increment of 20 feet. If they have managed to set up an ambush or other
      trap, they continue to employ crossbows for as long as possible. Otherwise, they close to bring their longspears
      into play. Although primarily used for fishing, these spears make formidable weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Locathahs lack teeth, claws, and other natural weapons, so they are not especially dangerous if unarmed. A
      weaponless locathah will generally turn and flee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="locathah--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> A locathah has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
      perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted
      or endangered.
    </p>
    <p>It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p>
    <h2 id="lycanthrope">Lycanthrope</h2>
    <p>
      Lycanthropes are humanoids or giants who can transform themselves into animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope
      looks like any other members of its kind, though natural lycanthropes and those who have been afflicted for a long
      time tend to have or acquire features reminiscent of their animal forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a
      powerful version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes (which often glow red in the dark) show a
      faint spark of unnatural intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lycanthropy can be spread like a disease. Sometimes a lycanthrope begins life as a normal humanoid or giant who
      subsequently contracts lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope. Such a creature is called an afflicted
      lycanthrope. Other lycanthropes are born as lycanthropes, and are known as natural lycanthropes.
    </p>
    <h3 id="lycanthrope--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A lycanthrope in its humanoid (or giant) form uses whatever tactics and weapons are favored by others of its kind,
      though it tends to be slightly more aggressive. A lycanthrope possesses the senses of its animal form, including
      scent and low-light vision, and it has a deep empathy for (and ability to communicate with) animals of its animal
      form. An afflicted lycanthrope damaged in combat may be overwhelmed by rage, causing it to change to its animal
      form involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lycanthrope in animal form fights like the animal it resembles, although its bite carries the disease of
      lycanthropy. It is preternaturally cunning and strong, and possesses damage reduction that is overcome only by
      silvered weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, a natural lycanthrope (or an afflicted lycanthrope that has become aware of its affliction) can assume a
      hybrid form that is a mix of its humanoid and animal forms. A hybrid has hands and can use weapons, but it can
      also attack with its teeth and claws. A hybrid can spread lycanthropy with its bite, and it has the same damage
      reduction that its animal form possesses.

      Werebears in humanoid form tend to be stout, well-muscled, and hairy. Their brown hair is thick, and males usually
      wear beards. They may have reddish, blond, ivory, or black hair, matching the color of the ursine form. They dress
      in simple cloth and leather garments that are easy to remove, repair, or replace
    </p>
    <h4 id="lycanthrope--werebear--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Werebears fight just as brown bears do in animal form. In humanoid or hybrid form, they favor large, heavy weapons
      such as greataxes or greatswords. The werebear’s greataxe is a Medium weapon, so it can wield the axe in one hand
      in hybrid form.

      Dire wereboars in giant form look much like normal hill giants, though slightly stockier, and with coarser,
      stiffer hair and stiff. The dire wereboar described here is based on a hill giant and natural lycanthrope with
      normal ability scores for a hill giant.

      Dire wereboars anger quickly. They usually begin a battle in giant form, then switch to hybrid form to take
      advantage of their immense strength in that shape. They like to use their Improved Bull Rush and Improved Sunder
      feats to shove opponents around and smash their weapons and shields.

    <p>
      “Lycanthrope” is a template that can be added to any humanoid or giant (referred to hereafter as the base
      creature). The lycanthrope template can be inherited (for natural lycanthropes) or acquired (for afflicted
      lycanthropes). Becoming a lycanthrope is very much like multiclassing as an animal and gaining the appropriate Hit
      Dice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lycanthrope--creating-a-lycanthrope--size-and-type">Size and Type:</strong> The base creature’s type
      does not change, but the creature gains the shapechanger subtype. The lycanthrope takes on the characteristics of
      some type of carnivorous or omnivorous creature of the animal type (referred to hereafter as the base animal).
    </p>
    <p>
      This animal can be any predator, scavenger, or omnivore whose size is within one size category of the base
      creature’s size (Small, Medium, or Large for a Medium base creature). Lycanthropes can also adopt a hybrid shape
      that combines features of the base creature and the base animal. A lycanthrope’s hybrid form is the same size as
      the base animal or the base creature, whichever is larger.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lycanthrope uses either the base creature’s or the base animal’s statistics and special abilities in addition to
      those described here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lycanthrope--creating-a-lycanthrope--hit-dice-and-hit-points">Hit Dice and Hit Points:</strong> Same
      as the base creature plus those of the base animal. To calculate total hit points, apply Constitution modifiers
      according to the score the lycanthrope has in each form.

    <p>
      <strong id="lycanthrope--creating-a-lycanthrope--speed">Speed:</strong> Same as the base creature or base animal,

      armor bonus increases by +2 in all forms. In hybrid form, the lycanthrope’s natural armor bonus is equal to the
      natural armor bonus of the base animal or the base creature, whichever is better.

    <p>
      <strong id="lycanthrope--creating-a-lycanthrope--base-attackgrapple">Base Attack/Grapple:</strong> Add the base
      attack bonus for the base animal to the base attack bonus for the base creature. The lycanthrope’s grapple bonus
      uses its attack bonus and modifiers for Strength and size depending on the lycanthrope’s form.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lycanthrope--creating-a-lycanthrope--attacks">Attacks:</strong> Same as the base creature or base
      animal, depending on which form the lycanthrope is using. A lycanthrope in hybrid form gains two claw attacks and
      a bite attack as natural weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      These weapons deal damage based on the hybrid form’s size. A hybrid may attack with a weapon and a bite, or may
      attack with its natural weapons. The bite attack of a hybrid is a secondary attack.

      Any skill given in the animal’s description is a class skill for the lycanthrope’s animal levels. In any form, a

      benefit unless the feat normally can be taken more once, in which case the duplicated feat works as noted in the

      It’s possible that a lycanthrope cannot meet the prerequisites for all its feats when in humanoid form. If this

    <h3 id="lycanthrope--lycanthropy-as-an-affliction">Lycanthropy as an Affliction</h3>
    <p>
      When a character contracts lycanthropy through a lycanthrope’s bite (see above), no symptoms appear until the
      first night of the next full moon. On that night, the afflicted character involuntarily assumes animal form and
      forgets his or her own identity, temporarily becoming an NPC. The character remains in animal form, assuming the
      appropriate alignment, until the next dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character’s actions during this first episode are dictated by the alignment of its animal form. The character
      remembers nothing about the entire episode (or subsequent episodes) unless he succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom check, in
      which case he becomes aware of his lycanthropic condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter, the character is subject to involuntary transformation under the full moon and whenever damaged in
      combat. He or she feels an overwhelming rage building up and must succeed on a Control Shape check (see below) to
      resist changing into animal form. Any player character not yet aware of his or her lycanthropic condition
      temporarily becomes an NPC during an involuntary change, and acts according to the alignment of his or her animal
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character with awareness of his condition retains his identity and does not lose control of his actions if he
      changes. However, each time he changes to his animal form, he must make a Will save (DC 15 + number of times he
      has been in animal form) or permanently assume the alignment of his animal form in all shapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a character becomes aware of his affliction, he can now voluntarily attempt to change to animal or hybrid
      form, using the appropriate Control Shape check DC. An attempt is a standard action and can be made each round.
      Any voluntary change to animal or hybrid form immediately and permanently changes the character’s alignment to
      that of the appropriate lycanthrope.
    </p>
    <h4 id="lycanthrope--lycanthropy-as-an-affliction--changing-form">Changing Form</h4>
    <p>
      Changing form is a standard action. If the change is involuntary, the character performs the change on his next
      turn following the triggering event. Changing to animal or hybrid form ruins the character’s armor and clothing
      (including any items worn) if the new form is larger than the character’s natural form; carried items are simply
      dropped. Characters can hastily doff clothing while changing, but not armor. Magic armor survives the change if it
      succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. An afflicted character who is not aware of his condition remains in animal
      form until the next dawn. An afflicted character who is aware of his or her condition (see above) can try to
      resume humanoid form following a change (voluntary or involuntary) with a Control Shape check, but if he fails his
      check, he remains in animal (or hybrid) form until the following dawn.

    <h4 id="lycanthrope--lycanthropy-as-an-affliction--curing-lycanthropy">Curing Lycanthropy</h4>
    <p>
      An afflicted character who eats a sprig of belladonna (also called wolfsbane) within 1 hour of a lycanthrope’s
      attack can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save to shake off the affliction. If a healer administers the herb, use the
      character’s save bonus or the healer’s Heal modifier, whichever is higher. The character gets only one chance, no
      matter how much belladonna is consumed. The belladonna must be reasonably fresh (picked within the last week).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, fresh or not, belladonna is toxic. The character must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1d6
      points of Strength damage. One minute later, the character must succeed on a second DC 13 save or take an
      additional 2d6 points of Strength damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i> spell cast by a cleric of 12th level or higher also cures the affliction,
      provided the character receives the spell within three days of the lycanthrope’s attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only other way to remove the affliction is to cast
      <i>remove curse</i> or <i>break enchantment</i> on the character during one of the three days of the full moon.
      After receiving the spell, the character must succeed on a DC 20 Will save to break the curse (the caster knows if
      the spell works). If the save fails, the process must be repeated.
    </p>
    <p>Characters undergoing this cure are often kept bound or confined in cages until the cure takes effect.</p>
    <p>Only afflicted lycanthropes can be cured of lycanthropy.</p>
    <h3 id="lycanthrope--lycanthropes-as-characters">Lycanthropes as Characters</h3>
    <p>
      Becoming a lycanthrope does not change a character’s favored class but usually changes alignment (see above). This
      alignment change may cause characters of certain classes to lose some of their class features.
    </p>
    <p>Lycanthrope characters possess the following racial traits.</p>
    <p>
      — +2 Wisdom. Physical abilities are increased by the animal form’s ability modifiers when a lycanthrope changes to
      its hybrid or animal forms.
    </p>
    <p>—Size same as the base creature or the base animal form.</p>
    <p>—Low-light vision in any form.</p>
    <p>—Scent in any form.</p>
    <p>
      —Racial Hit Dice: A lycanthrope adds the Hit Dice of its animal form to its base Hit Dice for race, level, and
      class. These additional Hit Dice modify the lycanthrope’s base attack bonus and base saving throw bonuses
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Racial Skills: A lycanthrope adds skill points for its animal Hit Dice much as if it had multiclassed into the
      animal type. It gains skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die of the animal form. Any
      skills that appear in the animal’s description are treated as class skills for the lycanthrope’s animal levels.
      The lycanthrope’s maximum skill ranks are equal to its animal form Hit Dice + its racial Hit Dice (if any) + its
      class levels + 3. Any racial skill adjustments of the lycanthrope’s base race and its animal form (but not
      conditional adjustments) are added to its skill modifiers in any form.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Racial Feats: Add the animal’s Hit Dice to the base character’s own Hit Dice to determine how many feats the
      character has. All lycanthropes gain Iron Will as a bonus feat.
    </p>
    <p>— +2 natural armor bonus in any form.</p>
    <p>
      —Special Qualities (see above): Alternate form, lycanthropic empathy, curse of lycanthropy (in animal or hybrid
      form only).
    </p>
    <p>—Afflicted lycanthrope: damage reduction 5/silver (in animal or hybrid form only).</p>
    <p>—Natural lycanthrope: damage reduction 10/silver (in animal or hybrid form only).</p>
    <p>—Automatic Languages: As base creature.</p>
    <p>—Favored Class: Same as the base creature.</p>
    <p>—Level adjustment: Same as the base creature +2 (afflicted) or +3 (natural).</p>
    <h3 id="lycanthrope--control-shape-wis">Control Shape (Wis)</h3>
    <p>
      Any character who has contracted lycanthropy and is aware of his condition can learn Control Shape as a class
      skill. (An afflicted lycanthrope not yet aware of his condition can attempt Control Shape checks untrained.) This
      skill determines whether an afflicted lycanthrope can control his shape. A natural lycanthrope does not need this
      skill, since it has full control over its shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lycanthrope--control-shape-wis--check-involuntary-change">Check (Involuntary Change):</strong> An
      afflicted character must make a check at moonrise each night of the full moon to resist involuntarily assuming
      animal form. An injured character must also check for an involuntary change after accumulating enough damage to
      reduce his hit points by one-quarter and again after each additional one-quarter lost.

      On a failed check, the character must remain in animal form until the next dawn, when he automatically returns to
      his base form. A character aware of his condition may make one attempt to return to humanoid form (see below), but
