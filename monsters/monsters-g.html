      Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, for they can perch indefinitely without moving and use this
      disguise to surprise their foes. They require no food, water, or air, but often eat their fallen foes out of
      fondness for inflicting pain.
    </p>
    <p>Gargoyles speak Common and Terran.</p>
    <h3 id="gargoyle--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>Gargoyles either remain still, then suddenly attack, or dive onto their prey.</p>
    <p>A gargoyle’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="gargoyle--combat--freeze-ex">Freeze (Ex):</strong> A gargoyle can hold itself so still it appears to

    <h2 id="genie">Genie</h2>
    <p>
      Genies are humanlike beings who dwell on the elemental planes. They are famous for their strength, guile, and
      skill with illusion magic.
    </p>
    <h3 id="genie--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Genies prefer to outmaneuver and outthink their foes. They are not too proud to flee if it means they’ll live to
      fight another day. If trapped, they bargain, offering treasure or favors in return for their lives and freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="genie--combat--plane-shift-sp"><i>Plane Shift</i> (Sp):</strong> A genie can enter any of the
      elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane. This ability transports the genie and up to eight other
      creatures, provided they all link hands with the genie. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name
      (caster level 13th).

    <p>The djinn (singular djinni) are genies from the Elemental Plane of Air.</p>
    <p>A djinni is about 10-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.</p>
    <p>Djinn speak Auran, Celestial, Common, and Ignan.</p>
    <h4 id="genie--djinni--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical powers and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni
      overmatched in combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind to harass those who follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="genie--djinni--combat--air-mastery-ex">Air Mastery (Ex):</strong> Airborne creatures take a –1 penalty
      on attack and damage rolls against a djinni.
    </p>

      >
      (self only); 1/day— <i>create food and water, create wine</i> (as <i>create water,</i> but wine instead),
      <i>major creation</i> (created vegetable matter is permanent), <i>persistent image</i> (DC 17),
      <i>wind walk.</i> Once per day, a djinni can assume <i>gaseous form</i> (as the spell) for up to 1 hour. Caster
      level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="genie--djinni--combat--whirlwind-su">Whirlwind (Su):</strong> A djinni can transform itself into a
      whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to 7 rounds. In this form, it can move through the
      air or along a surface at its fly speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top and up to 50 feet tall. The djinni
      controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A djinni’s movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the djinni enters the
      space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the
      whirlwind, or if the djinni moves into or through the creature’s space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the djinni might take damage when caught in the whirlwind and
      be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 20 Reflex save when it comes into contact with
      the whirlwind or take 3d6 points of damage. It must also succeed on a second DC 20 Reflex save or be picked up
      bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking 1d8 points of damage each round. A creature
      with a fly speed is allowed a DC 20 Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes
      damage but can leave if the save is successful. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +3 racial adjustment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the djinni carries them or to escape the
      whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC
      15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a –4 penalty to Dexterity and a –2
      penalty on attack rolls. The djinni can have only as many trapped inside a whirlwind at one time as will fit
      inside the whirlwind’s volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The djinni can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the whirlwind’s base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the
      djinni and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including
      darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total
      concealment.
    </p>
    <p>Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.</p>
    <p>A djinni in whirlwind form cannot make melee attacks and does not threaten the area around it.</p>
    <h4 id="genie--djinni--noble-djinn">Noble Djinn</h4>
    <p>
      Some djinn (1% of the total population) are noble. A noble djinni can grant three <i>wishes</i> to any being
      (nongenies only) who captures it. Noble djinn perform no other services and, upon granting the third
      <i>wish,</i> are free of their servitude. Noble djinn are as strong as efreet (see below), with 10 Hit Dice.

      The jann (singular janni) are the weakest of the genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must
      therefore spend most of their time on the Material Plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jann speak Common, one elemental language (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran) and one alignment language (Abyssal,
      Celestial, or Infernal).
    </p>
    <h4 id="genie--janni--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly to insult or injury. If they meet a foe they
      cannot defeat in a standup fight, they use flight and <i>invisibility</i> to regroup and maneuver to a more
      advantageous position.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="genie--janni--combat--change-size-sp"><i>Change Size</i> (Sp):</strong> Twice per day, a janni can
      magically change a creature’s size. This works just like an <i>enlarge person</i> or <i>reduce person</i> spell
      (the janni chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the janni. A DC 13 Fortitude save
      negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="genie--janni--combat--spell-like-abilities">Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> 3/day—<i>invisibility</i>
      (self only), <i>speak with animals.</i> Caster level 12th. Once per day a janni can
      <i>create food and water</i> (caster level 7th) and can use <i>ethereal jaunt</i> (caster level 12th) for 1 hour.
      The save DCs are Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="genie--janni--combat--elemental-endurance-ex">Elemental Endurance (Ex):</strong> Jann can survive on
      the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 48 hours. Failure to return to the Material Plane
      before that time expires causes a janni to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental
      plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.
    </p>
    <h4 id="genie--janni--jann-as-characters">Jann as Characters</h4>
    <p>Janni characters possess the following racial traits.</p>
    <p>— +6 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +4 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, +2 Charisma.</p>
    <p>—Medium size.</p>
    <p>—A janni’s base land speed is 30 feet. It also has a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect).</p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>
      —Racial Hit Dice: A janni begins with six levels of outsider, which provide 6d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of
      +6, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +5, Ref +5, and Will +5.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Racial Skills: A janni’s outsider levels give it skill points equal to 9 x (8 + Int modifier). Its class skills
      are Appraise, Concentration, Craft (any), Escape Artist, Listen, Move Silently, Ride, Sense Motive, and Spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Racial Feats: A janni’s outsider levels give it three feats. A janni receives Improved Initiative as a bonus
      feat.
    </p>
    <p>— +1 natural armor bonus.</p>
    <p>—Special Attacks (see above): <i>Change size,</i> spell-like abilities.</p>
    <p>
      —Special Qualities (see above): Elemental endurance,
      <i>plane shift,</i> resistance to fire 10, telepathy. 100 ft.

      A ghost greatly resembles its corporeal form in life, but in some cases the spiritual form is somewhat altered.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ghost--creating-a-ghost">Creating a Ghost</h3>
    <p>
      “Ghost” is an acquired template that can be added to any aberration, animal, dragon, giant, humanoid, magical
      beast, monstrous humanoid, or plant. The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) must have a
      Charisma score of at least 6.
    </p>
    <p>A ghost uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ghost--creating-a-ghost--size-and-type">Size and Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead.
      Do not recalculate the creature’s base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype.
      Size is unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ghost--creating-a-ghost--hit-dice">Hit Dice:</strong> All current and future Hit Dice become d12s.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ghost--creating-a-ghost--speed">Speed:</strong> Ghosts have a fly speed of 30 feet, unless the base
      creature has a higher fly speed, with perfect maneuverability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ghost--creating-a-ghost--armor-class">Armor Class:</strong> Natural armor is the same as the base
      creature’s but applies only to ethereal encounters. When the ghost manifests (see below), its natural armor bonus
      is +0, but it gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier or +1, whichever is higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ghost--creating-a-ghost--attack">Attack:</strong> A ghost retains all the attacks of the base
      creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect creatures that are not ethereal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ghost--creating-a-ghost--full-attack">Full Attack:</strong> A ghost retains all the attacks of the
      base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect creatures that are not ethereal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="ghost--creating-a-ghost--damage">Damage:</strong> Against ethereal creatures, a ghost uses the base
      creature’s damage values. Against nonethereal creatures, the ghost usually cannot deal physical damage at all but
      can use its special attacks, if any, when it manifests (see below).
    </p>

      <strong id="ghost--creating-a-ghost--special-attacks">Special Attacks:</strong> A ghost retains all the special
      attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect nonethereal creatures. The
      ghost also gains a manifestation ability plus one to three other special attacks as described below. The save DC
      against a special attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 ghost’s HD + ghost’s Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.

      adds its Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity
      modifier to attack rolls only.

      <em id="ghost--creating-a-ghost--special-attacks--draining-touch-su">Draining Touch (Su):</em> A ghost that hits a

      such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its
      Strength modifier to attack rolls only. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack
      rolls only.

    <p>
      <em id="ghost--creating-a-ghost--special-attacks--frightful-moan-su">Frightful Moan (Su):</em> A ghost can emit a
      frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or
      become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic necromantic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that

      <em id="ghost--creating-a-ghost--special-attacks--malevolence-su">Malevolence (Su):</em> Once per round, an
      ethereal ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a
      <i>magic jar</i> spell (caster level 10th or the ghost’s Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not
      require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be manifested and it must try move into the target’s
      space; moving into the target’s space to use the malevolence ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The
      target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 15 + ghost’s Cha modifier). A creature that
      successfully saves is immune to that same ghost’s malevolence for 24 hours, and the ghost cannot enter the
      target’s space. If the save fails, the ghost vanishes into the target’s body.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="ghost--creating-a-ghost--special-attacks--manifestation-su">Manifestation (Su):</em> Every ghost has this
      ability. A ghost dwells on the Ethereal Plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by
      anything in the material world. When a ghost manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible
      but incorporeal on the Material Plane. A manifested ghost can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic
      weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ghost can pass
      through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A manifested ghost always moves silently. A
      manifested ghost can strike with its touch attack or with a ghost touch weapon (see Ghostly Equipment, below). A
      manifested ghost remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where is it not incorporeal. A manifested ghost can be
      attacked by opponents on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The ghost’s incorporeality helps protect
      it from foes on the Material Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a spellcasting ghost is not manifested and is on the Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the
      Material Plane, but they work normally against ethereal targets. When a spellcasting ghost manifests, its spells
      continue to affect ethereal targets and can affect targets on the Material Plane normally unless the spells rely
      on touch. A manifested ghost’s touch spells don’t work on nonethereal targets.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ghost has two home planes, the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. It is not considered extraplanar when on
      either of these planes.

      <i>telekinesis</i> as a standard action (caster level 12th or equal to the ghost’s HD, whichever is higher). When
      a ghost uses this power, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using it again.

      Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. A ghost that would otherwise be destroyed
      returns to its old haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost’s HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only way
      to get rid of a ghost for sure is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it
      from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research.

    <h4 id="ghost--creating-a-ghost--ghostly-equipment">Ghostly Equipment</h4>
    <p>
      When a ghost forms, all its equipment and carried items usually become ethereal along with it. In addition, the
      ghost retains 2d4 items that it particularly valued in life (provided they are not in another creature’s
      possession). The equipment works normally on the Ethereal Plane but passes harmlessly through material objects or
      creatures. A weapon of +1 or better magical enhancement, however, can harm material creatures when the ghost
      manifests, but any such attack has a 50% chance to fail unless the weapon is a ghost touch weapon (just as magic
      weapons can fail to harm the ghost).
    </p>
    <p>
      The original material items remain behind, just as the ghost’s physical remains do. If another creature seizes the
      original, the ethereal copy fades away. This loss invariably angers the ghost, who stops at nothing to return the
      item to its original resting place.

      Cloud giants’ skin ranges in color from milky white to light sky blue. Their hair is silvery white or brass, and
      their eyes are iridescent blue. Adult males are about 18 feet tall and weigh about 5,000 pounds. Females are
      slightly shorter and lighter. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old.

      Cloud giants dress in the finest clothing available and wear jewelry. To many, appearance indicates station: The
      better the clothes and the finer the jewelry, the more important the wearer. They also appreciate music, and most

      A frost giant’s hair can be light blue or dirty yellow, and its eyes usually match its hair color. Frost giants
      dress in skins and pelts, along with any jewelry they own. Frost giant warriors add chain shirts and metal helmets
      decorated with horns or feathers.

      An adult male is about 15 feet tall and weighs about 2,800 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but

      Frost giants usually start combat at a distance, throwing rocks until they run out of ammunition or the opponent
      closes, then wading in with their enormous battleaxes.

      A favorite tactic is to lay an ambush by hiding buried in the snow at the top of an icy or snowy slope, where
      opponents will have difficulty reaching them.

      A frost giant leader is often a barbarian, cleric, fighter, or sorcerer, but some of the most evil and ruthless

    <p>
      The frost giant jarl described here has all the qualities and abilities of a typical frost giant, as well as other
      abilities (see the statistics block) from being a blackguard. Details on some of these abilities follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="giant--frost-giant-jarl--aura-of-despair-su">Aura of Despair (Su):</strong> This jarl radiates a
      malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a –2 penalty on all saving throws.

      <strong id="giant--frost-giant-jarl--aura-of-evil-ex">Aura of Evil (Ex):</strong> This jarl radiates a strong aura

    <p>
      <strong id="giant--frost-giant-jarl--command-undead-su">Command Undead (Su):</strong> This jarl can command and

      <strong id="giant--frost-giant-jarl--poison-use">Poison Use:</strong> Blackguards are skilled in the use of poison
      and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="giant--frost-giant-jarl--smite-good-su">Smite Good (Su):</strong> Twice per day, this jarl may attempt
      to smite good with one normal melee attack. He adds his +4 Charisma modifier to his attack roll and deals 8 points
      of extra damage (1 per blackguard level) if the attack hits. If he accidentally smites a creature that is not
      good, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day.

      Skin color among hill giants ranges from light tan to deep ruddy brown. Their hair is brown or black, with eyes
      the same color. Hill giants wear layers of crudely prepared hides with the fur left on. They seldom wash or repair

      edible, it begins a constant gibbering as a free action. All creatures (other than mouthers) within a 60-foot
      spread must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>confusion</i> spell for 1d2 rounds. This
      is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same
      gibbering mouther’s gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="gibbering-mouther--combat--spittle-ex">Spittle (Ex):</strong> As a free action every round, a
      gibbering mouther fires a stream of spittle at one opponent within 30 feet. The mouther makes a ranged touch
      attack; if it hits, it deals 1d4 points of acid damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or
      be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Eyeless creatures are immune to the blinding effect, but are still subject to the acid
      damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="gibbering-mouther--combat--improved-grab-ex">Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, a
      gibbering mouther must hit with a bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
      provoking an attack of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="gibbering-mouther--combat--blood-drain-ex">Blood Drain (Ex):</strong> On a successful grapple check
      after grabbing, that mouth attaches to the opponent. It automatically deals bite damage and drains blood, dealing
      1 point of Constitution damage each round. A mouth can be ripped off (dealing 1 point of damage) with a DC 12
      Strength check or severed by a successful sunder attempt (the mouth has 2 hit points).
    </p>
    <p>
      A severed mouth continues to bite and drain blood for 1d4 rounds after such an attack. A creature whose
      Constitution is reduced to 0 is killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="gibbering-mouther--combat--engulf-ex">Engulf (Ex):</strong> A gibbering mouther can try to engulf a
      Medium or smaller opponent grabbed by three or more mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opponent must succeed on a DC 14 Reflex save or fall and be engulfed. In the next round, the mouther makes
      twelve bite attacks instead of six (each with a +4 attack bonus). An engulfed creature cannot attack the mouther
      from within. The previously attached mouths are now free to attack others. The save DC is Strength-based and
      includes a +2 racial bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="gibbering-mouther--combat--ground-manipulation-su">Ground Manipulation (Su):</strong> At will, as a
      standard action, a gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth in all adjacent squares to become a morass akin to
      quicksand. Softening earth, sand, or the like takes 1 round, while stone takes 2 rounds. Anyone other than the
      mouther in that area must take a move-equivalent action to avoid becoming mired (treat as being pinned).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="gibbering-mouther--combat--amorphous-ex">Amorphous (Ex):</strong> A gibbering mouther is not subject
      to critical hits. It cannot be flanked.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="gibbering-mouther--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> Thanks to their multiple eyes, gibbering mouthers
      have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gibbering mouther has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It
      always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while
      swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

      Girallons are savage, magical cousins of the gorilla. When moving on the ground, a girallon walks on its legs and
      lower arms. An adult girallon is about 8 feet tall, broad-chested, and covered in thick, pure white fur. It weighs
      about 800 pounds.
    </p>
    <h3 id="girallon--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A solitary girallon usually conceals itself in the branches of a tree or under a pile of leaves and brush, with
      only its nose showing. When it spots or scents prey, it charges to the attack. A girallon picks up prey that is
      small enough to carry and withdraws, often vanishing into the trees before the victim’s companions can do anything
      to retaliate. Against larger foes, a girallon seeks to tear a single opponent to bits as quickly as it can.

      Gnolls are hyena-headed, evil humanoids that wander in loose tribes. Most gnolls have dirty yellow or
      reddish-brown fur. A gnoll is a nocturnal carnivore, preferring intelligent creatures for food because they scream
      more. A gnoll is about 7-1/2 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Gnolls speak Gnoll.
    </p>
    <h3 id="gnoll--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Gnolls like to attack when they have the advantage of numbers, using horde tactics and their physical strength to
      overwhelm and knock down their opponents. They show little discipline when fighting unless they have a strong
      leader; at such times, they can maintain ranks and fight as a unit. While they do not usually prepare traps, they
      do use ambushes and try to attack from a flanking position. Because of its shield, a gnoll’s modifier on Hide
      checks (untrained) is –2, which means gnolls always take special care to seek favorable conditions when laying
      ambushes (such as darkness, cover, or some other form of advantageous terrain).
    </p>
    <h3 id="gnoll--gnolls-as-characters">Gnolls as Characters</h3>
    <p>Gnoll characters possess the following racial traits.</p>
    <p>—Strength +4, Constitution +2, Intelligence –2, Charisma –2.</p>
    <p>—Size Medium.</p>
    <p>—A gnoll’s base land speed is 30 feet.</p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>
      —Racial Hit Dice: A gnoll begins with two levels of humanoid, which provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of
      +1, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Racial Skills: A gnoll’s humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 5 x (2 + Int modifier). Its class skills
      are Listen and Spot.
    </p>
    <p>—Racial Feats: A gnoll’s humanoid levels give it one feat.</p>
    <p>— +1 natural armor bonus.</p>

      Gnomes stand 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown,
      their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Gnome males prefer short, carefully trimmed beards.
      Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine
      jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years, though some can live almost 500
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gnomes speak their own language, Gnome. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome lands (as traders, tinkers, or
      adventurers) know Common, while warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin.

    <p>
      Most gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of 1st

    <p>The information above is for rock gnomes, the most common variety.</p>
    <p>There are two other major gnome subraces, which differ from rock gnomes as follows.</p>
    <h4 id="gnome--subraces--svirfneblin">Svirfneblin</h4>
    <p>Also called deep gnomes, svirfneblin are said to dwell in great cities deep underground.</p>
    <p>
      A svirfneblin has wiry, rock-colored skin usually medium brown to brownish gray. Only males are bald; females have
      stringy gray hair. The average svirfneblin lifespan is 250 years.
    </p>
    <p>Svirfneblin speak Gnome, Common, and Undercommon.</p>

      <strong id="gnome--subraces--svirfneblin--svirfneblin-traits-ex">Svirfneblin Traits (Ex):</strong> These traits
      are in addition to the rock gnome traits, except where noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      — –2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, –4 Charisma. These adjustments replace the rock gnome’s ability score
      adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Stonecunning: This ability grants deep gnomes a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework. A
      deep gnome who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as though actively
      searching, and can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A svirfneblin can also intuit
      depth, sensing the approximate distance underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.
    </p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 120 feet and low-light vision.</p>
    <p>—Spell resistance equal to 11 + class levels.</p>
    <p>
      — +2 racial bonus on all saving throws (figured into the statistics for the character presented here). This trait
      replaces the rock gnome’s racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion spells cast by svirfneblin. This adjustment
      stacks with those from similar effects, such as the Spell Focus feat.

    <p>— +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids.</p>
    <p>
      — +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against all creatures (figured into the statistics for the character presented

    </p>
    <p>
      —Automatic Languages: Undercommon, Gnome, Common. Bonus Languages: Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran.
      This trait replaces the rock gnome’s automatic and bonus languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—<i>blindness/deafness</i> (typical save DC 13), <i>blur, disguise self</i>. Caster
      level equals the svirfneblin’s class levels. The save DC is Charisma-based and include a +4 racial modifier. This
      trait replaces the rock gnome’s spell-like abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Nondetection (Su): A svirfneblin has a continuous nondetection ability as the spell (caster level equal to class
      levels).
    </p>
    <p>— +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) and Listen checks.</p>
    <p>— +2 racial bonus on Hide checks, which improves to +4 underground.</p>
    <p>—Favored Class: Rogue.</p>
    <p>—Level adjustment +3.</p>

    <h4 id="gnome--subraces--forest-gnome">Forest Gnome</h4>
    <p>
      They are the smallest of all the gnomes, averaging 2 to 2-1/2 feet in height, but look just like regular gnomes
      except with bark-colored or gray-green skin, and eyes that can be brown or green as well as blue. A very
      long-lived people, forest gnomes have an average life expectancy of 500 years.

      only, as a free action) as the spell cast by a druid of the forest gnome’s class levels.
    </p>
    <p>— +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds, goblinoids, orcs, and reptilian humanoids.</p>
    <p>
      —Automatic Languages: Gnome, Elven, Sylvan, and a simple language that enables them to communicate on a very basic
      level with forest animals (this replaces the rock gnome’s <i>speak with animals</i> ability). Bonus Languages:
      Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Giant, Goblin, Orc. This trait replaces the rock gnome’s automatic and bonus languages.

      A goblin stands 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Its eyes are usually dull and glazed, varying in
      color from red to yellow. A goblin’s skin color ranges from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red;
      usually all members of a single tribe are about the same color. Goblins wear clothing of dark leather, tending
      toward drab, soiled-looking colors. Goblins speak Goblin; those with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher also
      speak Common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most goblins encountered outside their homes are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of
      1st level.
    </p>
    <h3 id="goblin--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Being bullied by bigger, stronger creatures has taught goblins to exploit what few advantages they have: sheer
      numbers and malicious ingenuity. The concept of a fair fight is meaningless in their society. They favor ambushes,
      overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edge they can devise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goblins have a poor grasp of strategy and are cowardly by nature, tending to flee the field if a battle turns
      against them. With proper supervision, though, they can implement reasonably complex plans, and in such
      circumstances their numbers can be a deadly advantage.

      <strong id="goblin--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> Goblins have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently and Ride
      checks. Goblin cavalry (mounted on worgs) usually select the Mounted Combat feat in place of the Alertness feat,

    <h2 id="golem">Golem</h2>
    <p>
      Golems are magically created automatons of great power. Constructing one involves the employment of mighty magic
      and elemental forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animating force for a golem is a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. The process of creating the golem
      binds the unwilling spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem’s creator.
    </p>
    <h3 id="golem--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Golems are tenacious in combat and prodigiously strong as well. Being mindless, they do nothing without orders
      from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of any strategy or tactics. They are
      emotionless in combat and cannot be provoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A golem’s creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded,
      a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack.
      The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The golem’s creator
      can order the golem to obey the commands of another person (who might in turn place the golem under someone else’s
      control, and so on), but the golem’s creator can always resume control over his creation by commanding the golem
      to obey him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="golem--combat--immunity-to-magic-ex">Immunity to Magic (Ex):</strong> Golems have immunity to most
      magical and supernatural effects, except when otherwise noted.
    </p>
    <h3 id="golem--construction">Construction</h3>
    <p>
      The cost to create given for each golem includes the cost of the physical body and all the materials and spell
      components that are consumed or become a permanent part of the golem. Creating a golem is essentially similar to
      creating any sort of magic item. However, a golem’s body includes costly material components that may require some
      extra preparation. The golem’s creator can assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The builder must
      have the appropriate skill, which varies with the golem variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Completing the golem’s creation drains the appropriate XP from the creator and requires casting any spells on the
      final day.
    </p>
    <p>The creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come from outside sources, such as scrolls.</p>
    <p>
      The characteristics of a golem that come from its nature as a magic item (caster level, prerequisite feats and
      spells, market price, cost to create) are given in summary form at the end of each golem’s description.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="golem--construction--note">Note:</em> The market price of an advanced golem (a golem with more Hit Dice
      than the typical golem described in each entry) is increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die, and
      increased by an additional 50,000 gp if the golem’s size increases. The XP cost for creating an advanced golem is
      equal to 1/25 the advanced golem’s market price minus the cost of the special materials required.

      A flesh golem is a ghoulish collection of stolen humanoid body parts, stitched together into a single composite
      form. No natural animal willingly tracks a flesh golem. The golem wears whatever clothing its creator desires,
      usually just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no possessions and no weapons. It stands 8 feet tall and weighs
      almost 500 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flesh golem golem cannot speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of sorts. It walks and moves with a
      stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body.

      <strong id="golem--flesh-golem--combat--berserk-ex">Berserk (Ex):</strong> When a flesh golem enters combat, there
      is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. The
      uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than
      itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. The golem’s creator, if within
      60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem, which requires a DC 19
      Charisma check. It takes 1 minute of inactivity by the golem to reset the golem’s berserk chance to 0%.

      This golem has a humanoid body made from iron. An iron golem can be fashioned in any manner, just like a stone
      golem (see below), although it almost always displays armor of some sort. Its features are much smoother than
      those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a short sword in one hand. An iron golem is 12 feet tall and
      weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any
      distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it
      is on a thick, solid foundation.

      A gray render stands about 9 feet tall in spite of its hunched posture and is about 4 feet wide. It weighs about
      4,000 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gray renders are never found in groups. Each of these asexual creatures produces one offspring and carries it for
      a time in a pouch, but thereafter the young render must fend for itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A unique quality of the gray render is its tendency to bond with, protect, and provide for another creature (or
      group of creatures) native to its surroundings. Whether accepted or not, the render always attempts to remain
      fairly close, watching over its adopted charge(s) and daily bringing an offering of meat. It never willingly harms
      adopted creatures and retreats if they attack it.

      An adult grick is about 8 feet long from the tips of its tentacles to the end of its body and weighs some 200
      pounds. Its body coloration is uniformly dark, with a pale underbelly.
    </p>
    <h3 id="grick--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Gricks attack when hungry or threatened. They hunt by holing up near high-traffic areas, using their natural
      coloration to blend into convenient shadows. When prey (virtually anything that moves) ventures near, they lash
      out with their tentacles. A grick’s rubbery body seems to shed blows of any kind. Its jaws are relatively small
      and weak compared to its body mass, so rather than consume its kill immediately, a grick normally drags its victim
      back to its lair to be eaten at its leisure.
    </p>
    <p>A grick’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
    <p>
      Multiple gricks do not fight in concert. Each attacks the prey closest to it, and breaks off the fight as soon as
      it can drag dead or unconscious prey away.

      Griffons are powerful, majestic creatures with the characteristics of both lions and eagles. From nose to tail, an
      adult griffon can measure as much as 8 feet. Neither males nor females are endowed with a mane. A pair of broad,
      golden wings emerge from the creature’s back and span 25 feet or more. A griffon weighs about 500 pounds.
    </p>
    <p>A griffon cannot speak, but understands Common.</p>
    <h3 id="griffon--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>Griffons prefer to pounce on their prey, either diving to the attack or leaping from above.</p>

      <strong id="griffon--combat--pounce-ex">Pounce (Ex):</strong> If a griffon dives upon or charges a foe, it can

    <h3 id="griffon--training-a-griffon">Training a Griffon</h3>
    <p>
      Although intelligent, a griffon requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a griffon
      must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check).
      Training a friendly griffon requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a griffon requires
      an exotic saddle. A griffon can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she
      succeeds on a Ride check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Griffon eggs are worth 3,500 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 7,000 gp each. Professional
      trainers charge 1,500 gp to rear or train a griffon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrying Capacity: A light load for a griffon is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy
      load, 601–900 pounds.

    <h3 id="grimlock--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Grimlocks are blind, but their exceptional senses of smell and hearing allow them to notice foes nearby. As a
      result, they usually shun ranged weapons and rush to the attack, brandishing their stone battleaxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="grimlock--combat--blindsight-ex">Blindsight (Ex):</strong> Grimlocks can sense all foes within 40 feet
      as a sighted creature would. Beyond that range, they treat all targets as having total concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grimlocks are susceptible to sound- and scent-based attacks, however, and are affected normally by loud noises and
      sonic spells (such as
      <i>ghost sound</i> or <i>silence</i>) and overpowering odors (such as <i>stinking cloud</i> or incense-heavy air).
      Negating a grimlock’s sense of smell or hearing reduces this ability to normal Blind-Fight (as the feat). If both
      these senses are negated, a grimlock is effectively blinded.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="grimlock--combat--immunities">Immunities:</strong> Grimlocks are immune to gaze attacks, visual
      effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="grimlock--combat--skills">Skills:</strong> *A grimlock’s dull gray skin helps it hide in its native
      terrain, conferring a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks when in mountains or underground.
