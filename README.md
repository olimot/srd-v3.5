# Revised (v.3.5) System Reference Document

**a HTML version of Revised (v.3.5) System Reference Document.**

The Revised (v.3.5) System Reference Document project aims to provide an HTML version of the original Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 System Reference Document (SRD), making it more accessible and easier to navigate. The project involves converting RTF files from the archived download page into HTML, creating an index file to serve as a homepage, standardizing heading levels (H1, H2, etc.), correcting formatting errors, and generating a table of contents for each HTML page. This effort builds on the original SRD by Wizards of the Coast, leveraging archived resources and a Markdown version for improved usability and organization.
