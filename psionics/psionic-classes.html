    <h2 id="the-power-point-reserve">The Power Point Reserve</h2>
    <p>
      Psionic characters fuel their abilities through a pool, or reserve, of power points. Your power point reserve is
      equal to your base power points gained from your class, bonus power points from a high key ability score (see
      Abilities and Manifesters, below), and any additional bonus power points from sources such as your character race
      and feat selections.
    </p>
    <h3 id="multiclass-psionic-characters">Multiclass Psionic Characters</h3>
    <p>
      If you have levels in more than one psionic class, you combine your power points from each class to make up your
      reserve. You can use these power points to manifest powers from any psionic class you have.
    </p>
    <p>
      While you maintain a single reserve of power points from your class, race, and feat selections, you are still
      limited by the manifester level you have achieved with each power you know.
    </p>
    <h2 id="abilities-and-manifesters">Abilities and Manifesters</h2>
    <p>
      The ability that your powers depend on—your key ability score as a manifester—is related to what psionic class (or
      classes) you have levels in: Intelligence (psion), Wisdom (psychic warrior), and Charisma (wilder). The modifier
      for this ability is referred to as your key ability modifier. If your character’s key ability score is 9 or lower,
      you can’t manifest powers from that psionic class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as a high Intelligence score grants bonus spells to a wizard and a high Wisdom score grants bonus spells to a
      cleric, a character who manifests powers (psions, psychic warriors, and wilders) gains bonus power points
      according to his key ability score. Refer to Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How To Determine Bonus Power Points:</strong> Your key ability score grants you additional power points
      equal to your key ability modifier x your manifester level x1/2. Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points
      shows these calculations for class levels 1st through 20th and key ability scores from 10 to 41.

    <h3 id="psion--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are class features of the psion.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Psions are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light
      crossbow, quarterstaff, and shortspear. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor does not,
      however, interfere with the manifestation of powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Power Points/Day:</strong> A psion’s ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has
      available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The Psion. In addition, he receives bonus
      power points per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points).
      His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Discipline:</strong> Every psion must decide at 1st level which psionic discipline he will specialize in.
      Choosing a discipline provides a psion with access to the class skills associated with that discipline (see
      above), as well as the powers restricted to that discipline. However, choosing a discipline also means that the
      psion cannot learn powers that are restricted to other disciplines. He can’t even use such powers by employing
      psionic items.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powers Known:</strong> A psion begins play knowing three psion powers of your choice. Each time he
      achieves a new level, he unlocks the knowledge of new powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose the powers known from the psion power list, or from the list of powers of your chosen discipline. You
      cannot choose powers from disciplines other than your chosen discipline. (<i>Exception:</i> The feats Expanded
      Knowledge and Epic Expanded Knowledge do allow a psion to learn powers from the lists of other disciplines or even
      other classes.) A psion can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester
      level.
    </p>
    <p>The number of times a psion can manifest powers in a day is limited only by his daily power points.</p>
    <p>
      A psion simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that
      some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night’s sleep each day to regain all his spent
      power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Difficulty Class for saving throws against psion powers is 10 + the power’s level + the psion’s Intelligence
      modifier.
      <b>Maximum Power Level Known:</b> A psion begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As he attains
      higher levels, a psion may gain the ability to master more complex powers.
    </p>
    <p>To learn or manifest a power, a psion must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the power’s level.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Feats:</strong> A psion gains a bonus feat at 1st level, 5th level, 10th level, 15th level, and 20th
      level. This feat must be a psionic feat, a metapsionic feat, or a psionic item creation feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains every three levels. A psion is
      not limited to psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats when choosing these other feats.
    </p>
    <h3 id="psionic-disciplines">Psionic Disciplines</h3>
    <p>
      A discipline is one of six groupings of powers, each defined by a common theme. The six disciplines are
      clairsentience, metacreativity, psychokinesis, psychometabolism, psychoportation, and telepathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Clairsentience:</strong> A psion who chooses clairsentience is known as a seer. Seers can learn
      precognitive powers to aid their comrades in combat, as well as powers that permit them to gather information in
      many different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Metacreativity:</strong> A psion specializing in metacreativity is known as a shaper. This discipline
      includes powers that draw ectoplasm or matter from the Astral Plane, creating semisolid and solid items such as
      armor, weapons, or animated constructs to do battle at the shaper’s command.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psychokinesis:</strong> Psions who specialize in psychokinesis are known as kineticists. They are the
      masters of powers that manipulate and transform matter and energy. Kineticists can attack with devastating blasts
      of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psychometabolism:</strong> A psion who specializes in psychometabolism is known as an egoist. This
      discipline consists of powers that alter the psion’s psychobiology, or that of creatures near him. An egoist can
      both heal and transform himself into a fearsome fighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psychoportation:</strong> A psion who relies on psychoportation powers is known as a nomad. Nomads can
      wield powers that propel or displace objects in space or time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Telepathy:</strong> A psion who chooses the discipline of telepathy is known as a telepath. He is the
      master of powers that allow mental contact and control of other sentient creatures. A telepath can deceive or
      destroy the minds of his enemies with ease.

    <p>
      A psicrystal is a fragment of a psionic character’s personality, brought into physical form and a semblance of
      life (via the Psicrystal Affinity feat). A psicrystal appears as a crystalline construct about the size of a human
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it is an extension of its creator’s personality, a character’s psicrystal is in some ways a part of him.
      That’s why, for example, a psionic character can manifest a personal range power on his psicrystal even though
      normally he can manifest such a power only on himself.
    </p>
    <p>A psicrystal is treated as a construct for the purposes of all effects that depend on its type.</p>
    <p>
      A psicrystal grants special abilities to its owner, as shown on the Psicrystal Special Abilities table below. In
      addition, a psicrystal has a personality (being a fragment of the owner’s personality), which gives its owner a
      bonus on certain types of checks or saving throws, as given on the Psicrystal Personalities table below. These
      special abilities and bonuses apply only when the owner and the psicrystal are within 1 mile of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psicrystal abilities are based on the owner’s levels in psionic classes. Levels from other classes do not count
      toward the owner’s level for purposes of psicrystal abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      A psicrystal can speak one language of its owner’s choice (so long as it is a language the owner knows). A
      psicrystal can understand all other languages known by its owner, but cannot speak them. This is a supernatural
      ability.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Psicrystal Basics:</strong> Use the statistics for a psicrystal, but make the following changes.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Saving Throws:</em> A psicrystal uses its owner’s base saving throw bonuses and ability modifiers on saves,
      though it doesn’t enjoy any other bonuses its owner might have (from magic items or feats, for example).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Abilities:</em> When its self-propulsion ability is not activated, a psicrystal has no Strength score and no
      Dexterity score.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Skills:</em> A psicrystal has the same skill ranks as its owner, except that it has a minimum of 4 ranks each
      in Spot, Listen, Move Silently, and Search. (Even if its owner has no ranks in these skills, a psicrystal has 4
      ranks in each.) A psicrystal uses its own ability modifiers on skill checks.

      <strong>Psicrystal Ability Descriptions:</strong> All psicrystals have special abilities (or impart abilities to
      their owners) depending on the level of the owner, as shown on the table above. The abilities on the table are
      cumulative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Natural Armor Adj. (Ex):</em> This number noted here is an improvement to the psicrystal’s natural armor bonus
      (normally 0). It represents a psicrystal’s preternatural durability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Intelligence Adj. (Ex):</em> Add this value to the psicrystal’s Intelligence score. Psicrystals are as smart
      as people (though not necessarily as smart as smart people).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Alertness (Ex):</em> The presence of a psicrystal sharpens its master’s senses. While a psicrystal is within
      arm’s reach (adjacent to or in the same square as its owner), its owner gains the Alertness feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Improved Evasion (Ex):</em> If a psicrystal is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving
      throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving
      throw fails.
    </p>
    <p><em>Personality (Ex):</em> Every psicrystal has a personality. See Psicrystal Personality, below.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Self-Propulsion (Su):</em> As a standard action, its owner can will a psicrystal to form spidery, ectoplasmic
      legs that grant the psicrystal a land speed of 30 feet and a climb speed of 20 feet. The legs fade into
      nothingness after one day (or sooner, if the owner desires).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Share Powers (Su):</em> At the owner’s option, he can have any power (but not any psi-like ability) he
      manifests on himself also affect his psicrystal. The psicrystal must be within 5 feet of him at the time of the
      manifestation to receive the benefit. If the power has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the
      psicrystal if it moves farther than 5 feet away, and will not affect the psicrystal again, even if it returns to
      its owner before the duration expires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the owner can manifest a power with a target of “You” on his psicrystal (as a touch range power)
      instead of on himself. The owner and psicrystal cannot share powers if the powers normally do not affect creatures
      of the psicrystal’s type (construct).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Sighted (Ex):</em> Although it has no physical sensory organs, a psicrystal can telepathically sense its
      environment as well as a creature with normal vision and hearing. Darkness (even supernatural darkness) is
      irrelevant, as are areas of supernatural silence, though a psicrystal still can’t discern invisible or ethereal
      beings. A psicrystal’s sighted range is 40 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Telepathic Link (Su):</em> The owner has a telepathic link with his psicrystal out to a distance of up to 1
      mile. The owner cannot see through the psicrystal’s senses, but the two of them can communicate telepathically as
      if the psicrystal were the target of a <i>mindlink</i> power manifested by the owner. For instance, a psicrystal
      placed in a distant room could relay the activities occurring in that room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the telepathic link between a psicrystal and its owner, the owner has the same connection to an item or
      place that the psicrystal does. For instance, if his psicrystal has seen a room, the owner can teleport into that
      room as if he has seen it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Deliver Touch Powers (Su):</em> If the owner is 3rd level or higher, his psicrystal can deliver touch powers
      for him. If the owner and psicrystal are in contact at the time the owner manifests a touch power, he can
      designate his psicrystal as the “toucher.” The psicrystal can then deliver the touch power just as the owner
      could. As usual, if the owner manifests another power before the touch is delivered, the touch power dissipates.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Telepathic Speech (Ex):</em> If the owner is 5th level or higher, the psicrystal can communicate
      telepathically with any creature that has a language and is within 30 feet of the psicrystal, while the psicrystal
      is also within 1 mile of the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Flight (Su):</em> If the owner is 9th level or higher, he can, as a standard action, will his psicrystal to
      fly at a speed of 50 feet (poor). The psicrystal drifts gently to the ground after one day (or sooner, if the
      owner desires).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Power Resistance (Ex):</em> If the owner is 11th level or higher, the psicrystal gains power resistance equal
      to the owner’s level + 5. To affect the psicrystal with a power, another manifester must get a result on a
      manifester level check that equals or exceeds the psicrystal’s power resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Sight Link (Sp):</em> If the owner is 13th level or higher, the character can remote view the psicrystal (as
      if manifesting the <i>remote view</i> power) once per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Channel Power (Sp):</em> If the owner is 15th level or higher, he can manifest powers through the psicrystal
      to a distance of up to 1 mile. The psicrystal is treated as the power’s originator, and all ranges are calculated
      from its location.
    </p>
    <p>
      When channeling a power through his psicrystal, the owner manifests the power by paying its power point cost. He
      is still subject to attacks of opportunity and other hazards of manifesting a power, if applicable (for instance,
      he becomes visible when manifesting an offensive power if
      <i>invisible</i>, as does the psicrystal).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psicrystal Personality (Ex):</strong> Each psicrystal has a distinct personality, chosen by its owner at
      the time of its creation from among those given on the following table. At 1st level, its owner typically gets a
      feel for a psicrystal’s personality only through occasional impulses, but as the owner increases in level the
      psicrystal’s personality becomes more pronounced. At higher levels, it is not uncommon for a psicrystal to
      constantly ply its owner with observations and advice, often severely slanted toward the psicrystal’s particular
      worldview. The owner always sees a bit of himself in his psicrystal, even if magnified and therefore distorted.

    <h3 id="psychic-warrior--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are class features of the psychic warrior.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Psychic warriors are proficient with all simple and martial
      weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Power Points/Day:</strong> A psychic warrior’s ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points
      he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The Psychic Warrior. In addition, he
      receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power
      Points). His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items. A 1st-level psychic
      warrior gains no power points for his class level, but he gains bonus power points (if he is entitled to any), and
      can manifest the single power he knows with those power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powers Known:</strong> A psychic warrior begins play knowing one psychic warrior power of your choice.
      Each time he achieves a new level, he unlocks the knowledge of a new power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose the powers known from the psychic warrior power list. (<i>Exception:</i>
      The feats Expanded Knowledge and Epic Expanded Knowledge do allow a psychic warrior to learn powers from the lists
      of other classes.) A psychic warrior can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his
      manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>The total number of powers a psychic warrior can manifest in a day is limited only by his daily power points.</p>
    <p>
      A psychic warrior simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in
      the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night’s sleep each day to regain
      all his spent power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Difficulty Class for saving throws against psychic warrior powers is 10 + the power’s level + the psychic
      warrior’s Wisdom modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Maximum Power Level Known:</strong> A psychic warrior begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level
      powers. As he attains higher levels, he may gain the ability to master more complex powers.
    </p>
    <p>To learn or manifest a power, a psychic warrior must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the power’s level.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Feats:</strong> At 1st level, a psychic warrior gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the
      feat that any 1st level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The psychic warrior gains
      an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every three levels thereafter (5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th).
      These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats or psionic feats. The psychic warrior
      must still meet all prerequisites for the bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums as
      well as class requirements. A psychic warrior cannot choose feats that specifically require levels in the fighter
      class unless he is a multiclass character with the requisite levels in the fighter class.
    </p>
    <p>
      These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains every three levels. A psychic
      warrior is not limited to fighter bonus feats and psionic feats when choosing these other feats.

    <h3 id="soulknife--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are class features of the soulknife.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Soulknives are proficient with all simple weapons, with their own
      mind blades, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mind Blade (Su):</strong> As a move action, a soulknife can create a semisolid blade composed of psychic
      energy distilled from his own mind. The blade is identical in all ways (except visually) to a short sword of a
      size appropriate for its wielder. For instance, a Medium soulknife materializes a Medium mind blade that he can
      wield as a light weapon, and the blade deals 1d6 points of damage (crit 19–20/x2). Soulknives who are smaller or
      larger than Medium create mind blades identical to short swords appropriate for their size, with a corresponding
      change to the blade’s damage. The wielder of a mind blade gains the usual benefits to his attack roll and damage
      roll from a high Strength bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blade can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 hit points); however, a soulknife can simply create another on
      his next move action. The moment he relinquishes his grip on his blade, it dissipates (unless he intends to throw
      it; see below). A mind blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soulknife can use feats such as Power Attack or Combat Expertise in conjunction with the mind blade just as if
      it were a normal weapon. He can also choose mind blade for feats requiring a specific weapon choice, such as
      Weapon Specialization. Powers or spells that upgrade weapons can be used on a mind blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soulknife’s mind blade improves as the character gains higher levels. At 4th level and every four levels
      thereafter, the mind blade gains a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls (+2 at 8th
      level, +3 at 12th level, +4 at 16th level, and +5 at 20th level).
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in places where psionic effects do not normally function (such as within a <i>null psionics field</i>), a
      soulknife can attempt to sustain his mind blade by making a DC 20 Will save. On a successful save, the soulknife
      maintains his mind blade for a number of rounds equal to his class level before he needs to check again. On an
      unsuccessful attempt, the mind blade vanishes. As a move action on his turn, the soulknife can attempt a new Will
      save to rematerialize his mind blade while he remains within the psionics negating effect.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Weapon Focus (Mind Blade):</strong> A soulknife gains Weapon Focus (mind blade) as a bonus feat.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Wild Talent:</strong> A soulknife gains Wild Talent as a bonus feat. (This class feature provides the
      character with the psionic power he needs to materialize his mind blade, if he has no power points otherwise.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Throw Mind Blade (Ex):</strong> A soul knife of 2nd level or higher can throw his mind blade as a ranged
      weapon with a range increment of 30 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not the attack hits, a thrown mind blade then dissipates. A soulknife of 3rd level or higher can make a
      psychic strike (see below) with a thrown mind blade and can use the blade in conjunction with other special
      abilities (such as Knife to the Soul; see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psychic Strike (Su):</strong> As a move action, a soulknife of 3rd level or higher can imbue his mind
      blade with destructive psychic energy. This effect deals an extra 1d8 points of damage to the next living,
      nonmindless target he successfully hits with a melee attack (or ranged attack, if he is using the throw mind blade
      ability). Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to psychic strike damage. (Unlike the rogue’s
      sneak attack, the psychic strike is not precision damage and can affect creatures otherwise immune to extra damage
      from critical hits or more than 30 feet away, provided they are living, nonmindless creatures not immune to
      mind-affecting effects.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A mind blade deals this extra damage only once when this ability is called upon, but a soulknife can imbue his
      mind blade with psychic energy again by taking another move action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a soulknife has prepared his blade for a psychic strike, it holds the extra energy until it is used. Even if
      the soulknife drops the mind blade (or it otherwise dissipates, such as when it is thrown and misses), it is still
      imbued with psychic energy when the soulknife next materializes it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At every four levels beyond 3rd (7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th), the extra damage from a soulknife’s psychic strike
      increases as shown on the Table above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Free Draw (Su):</strong> At 5th level, a soulknife becomes able to materialize his mind blade as a free
      action instead of a move action. He can make only one attempt to materialize the mind blade per round, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shape Mind Blade (Su):</strong> At 5th level, a soulknife gains the ability to change the form of his mind
      blade. As a fullround action, he can change his mind blade to replicate a longsword (damage 1d8 for a Medium
      weapon wielded as a one-handed weapon) or a bastard sword (damage 1d10 for a Medium weapon, but he must wield it
      as a two-handed weapon unless he knows the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (bastard sword) feat). If a soulknife shapes
      his mind blade into the form of a bastard sword and wields it two-handed, he adds 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus
      to his damage rolls, just like when using any other two-handed weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, a soulknife can split his mind blade into two identical short swords, suitable for fighting with a
      weapon in each hand. (The normal penalties for fighting with two weapons apply.) However, both mind blades have an
      enhancement bonus 1 lower than the soulknife would otherwise create with a single mind blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mind Blade Enhancement (Su):</strong> At 6th level, a soulknife gains the ability to enhance his mind
      blade. He can add any one of the weapon special abilities on the table below that has an enhancement bonus value
      of +1.
    </p>
    <p>
      At every four levels beyond 6th (10th, 14th, and 18th), the value of the enhancement a soulknife can add to his
      weapon improves to +2, +3, and +4, respectively. A soulknife can choose any combination of weapon special
      abilities that does not exceed the total allowed by the soulknife’s level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weapon ability or abilities remain the same every time the soulknife materializes his mind blade (unless he
      decides to reassign its abilities; see below). The ability or abilities apply to any form the mind blade takes,
      including the use of the shape mind blade or bladewind class abilities.

      A soulknife can reassign the ability or abilities he has added to his mind blade. To do so, he must first spend 8
      hours in concentration. After that period, the mind blade materializes with the new ability or abilities selected
      by the soulknife.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Speed of Thought:</strong> A soulknife gains Speed of Thought as a bonus feat at 6th level.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bladewind (Su):</strong> At 9th level, a soulknife gains the ability to momentarily fragment his mind
      blade into numerous identical blades, each of which strikes at a nearby opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a full attack, when wielding his mind blade, a soulknife can give up his regular attacks and instead fragment
      his mind blade to make one melee attack at his full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. Each
      fragment functions identically to the soulknife’s regular mind blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using bladewind, a soulknife forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as
      the Cleave feat or the
      <i>haste</i> spell).
    </p>
    <p>The mind blade immediately reverts to its previous form after the bladewind attack.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Greater Weapon Focus (Mind Blade):</strong> A soulknife gains Greater Weapon Focus (mind blade) as a bonus
      feat at 9th level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Knife to the Soul (Su):</strong> Beginning at 13th level, when a soulknife executes a psychic strike, he
      can choose to substitute Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (his choice) for extra dice of damage. For each
      die of extra damage he gives up, he deals 1 point of damage to the ability score he chooses. A soulknife can
      combine extra dice of damage and ability damage in any combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soulknife decides which ability score his psychic strike damages and the division of ability damage and extra
      dice of damage when he imbues his mind blade with the psychic strike energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Multiple Throw (Ex):</strong> At 17th level and higher, a soulknife can throw a number of mind blades per
      round equal to the number of melee attacks he could make.

    <h3 id="wilder--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are class features of the wilder.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Wilders are proficient with all simple weapons, with light armor,
      and with shields (except tower shields).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Power Points/Day:</strong> A wilder’s ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points she has
      available. Her base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The Wilder. In addition, she receives bonus
      power points per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). Her
      race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powers Known:</strong> A wilder begins play knowing one wilder power of your choice. At every
      even-numbered class level after 1st, she unlocks the knowledge of new powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose the powers known from the wilder power list. (<i>Exception:</i> The feats Expanded Knowledge and Epic
      Expanded Knowledge do allow a wilder to learn powers from the lists of other classes.) A wilder can manifest any
      power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than her manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>The total number of powers a wilder can manifest in a day is limited only by her daily power points.</p>
    <p>
      A wilder simply knows her powers; they are ingrained in her mind. She does not need to prepare them (in the way
      that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though she must get a good night’s sleep each day to regain all her
      spent power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Difficulty Class for saving throws against wilder powers is 10 + the power’s level + the wilder’s Charisma
      modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Maximum Power Level Known:</strong> A wilder begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As
      she attains higher levels, she may gain the ability to master more complex powers.
    </p>
    <p>To learn or manifest a power, a wilder must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the power’s level.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Wild Surge (Su):</strong> A wilder can let her passion and emotion rise to the surface in a wild surge
      when she manifests a power. During a wild surge, a wilder gains phenomenal psionic strength, but may harm herself
      by the reckless use of her power (see Psychic Enervation, below).
    </p>
    <p>
      A wilder can choose to invoke a wild surge whenever she manifests a power. When she does so, she gains +1 to her
      manifester level with that manifestation of the power. The manifester level boost gives her the ability to augment
      her powers to a higher degree than she otherwise could; however, she pays no extra power point for this wild
      surge. Instead, the additional 1 power point that would normally be required to augment the power is effectively
      supplied by the wild surge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Level-dependent power effects are also improved, depending on the power a wilder manifests with her wild surge.
    </p>
    <p>
      This improvement in manifester level does not grant her any other benefits (psicrystal abilities do not advance,
      she does not gain higher-level class abilities, and so on).
    </p>
    <p>She cannot use the Overchannel psionic feat and invoke her wild surge at the same time.</p>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, a wilder can choose to boost her manifester level by two instead of one. At 7th level, she can boost
      her manifester level by up to three; at 11th level, by up to four; at 15th level, by up to five; and at 19th
      level, by up to six.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all cases, the wild surge effectively pays the extra power point cost that is normally required to augment the
      power; only the unaugmented power point cost is subtracted from the wilder’s power point reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psychic Enervation (Ex):</strong> Pushing oneself by invoking a wild surge is dangerous. Immediately
      following each wild surge, a wilder may be overcome by the strain of her effort. The chance of suffering psychic
      enervation is equal to 5% per manifester level added with the wild surge.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wilder who is overcome by psychic enervation is dazed until the end of her next turn and loses a number of power
      points equal to her wilder level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Elude Touch (Ex):</strong> Starting at 2nd level, a wilder’s intuition supersedes her intellect, alerting
      her to danger from touch attacks (including rays). She gains a bonus to Armor Class against all touch attacks
      equal to her Charisma bonus; however, her touch AC can never exceed her Armor Class against normal attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Surging Euphoria (Ex):</strong> Starting at 4th level, when a wilder uses her wild surge ability, she
      gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to the
      intensity of her wild surge.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a wilder is overcome by psychic enervation following her wild surge, she does not gain the morale bonus for
      this use of her wild surge ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 12th level, the morale bonus on a wilder’s attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws increases to +2. At
      20th level, the bonus increases to +3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Volatile Mind (Ex):</strong> A wilder’s temperamental mind is hard to encompass with the discipline of
      telepathy. When any telepathy power is manifested on a wilder of 5th level or higher, the manifester of the power
      must pay 1 power point more than he otherwise would have spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extra cost is not a natural part of that power’s cost. It does not augment the power; it is simply a wasted
      power point. The wilder’s volatile mind can force the manifester of the telepathy power to exceed the normal power
      point limit of 1 point per manifester level. If the extra cost raises the telepathy power’s cost to more points
      than the manifester has remaining in his reserve, the power simply fails, and the manifester exhausts the rest of
      his power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 9th level, the penalty assessed against telepathy powers manifested on a wilder is increased to 2 power points.
      At 13th level, the penalty increases to 3 power points, and at 17th level it increases to 4 power points.
    </p>
    <p>As a standard action, a wilder can choose to lower this effect for 1 round.</p>

    <h3 id="cerebremancer--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are class features of the cerebremancer prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Cerebremancers gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells per Day/Powers Known:</strong> When a new cerebremancer level is attained, the character gains new
      spells per day as if he had also attained a level in any one arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before he
      added the prestige class. He gains additional power points per day and access to new powers as if he had also
      gained a level in any one manifesting class he belonged to previously. He does not, however, gain any other
      benefit a character of either class would have gained (bonus metamagic, metapsionic, or item creation feats,
      psicrystal special abilities, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of cerebremancer to the
      level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class and manifesting class the character has, then determines spells
      per day, caster level, power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class or more than one manifesting class before he became a
      cerebremancer, he must decide to which class he adds each level of cerebremancer for purpose of determining spells
      per day, caster level, power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.

    <h3 id="elocater--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are class features of the elocater prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Elocaters are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and
      with light armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powers Known:</strong> At every level indicated on the table, the character gains additional power points
      per day and access to new powers as if she had also gained a level in whatever manifesting class she belonged to
      before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would
      have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities, and so on). This
      essentially means that she adds the level of elocater to the level of whatever manifesting class the character
      has, then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character had more than one manifesting class before she became an elocater, she must decide to which class
      she adds the new level of elocater for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and
      manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Scorn Earth (Su):</strong> At 1st level, an elocater’s feet lift from the ground. From now on, she can
      float a foot above the ground. Instead of walking she glides along, unconcerned with the hard earth or difficult
      terrain. While she remains within 1 foot of a flat surface of any solid or liquid, she can take normal actions and
      make normal attacks, and can move at her normal speed (she can even “run” at four times her normal speed).
      However, at distances higher than 1 foot above any surface, her speed diminishes to 10 feet per round.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she remains within 1 foot of a surface, she can make melee and ranged attacks normally, but if she moves any
      higher, she incurs the penalties on melee and ranged attack rolls as if she were the subject of the
      <i>psionic levitate</i> power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sidestep Charge (Ex):</strong> At 1st level, an elocater gains Sidestep Charge as a bonus feat, even if
      she does not meet the prerequisites. If the character already has this feat, she gains no benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Opportunistic Strike (Ex):</strong> Beginning at 2nd level, an elocater’s hyperawareness of spatial
      relations gives her an instinctive view of the battlefield, which allows her to make a cunning attack against
      distracted opponents. The elocater gains a +2 insight bonus on her attack roll and her damage roll (if the attack
      hits) for the first attack she makes against an opponent that has been dealt damage in melee by another character
      since the elocater’s last action. At 5th level the insight bonus increases to +4, and at 8th level the insight
      bonus increases to +6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dimension Step (Su):</strong> An elocater of 3rd level or higher can slip psionically between spaces as if
      using the <i>psionic dimension door</i> power, once per day. The elocater cannot bring any other creatures with
      her. Her manifester level for this effect is equal to her elocater level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Flanker (Ex):</strong> An elocater of 4th level or higher can flank enemies from seemingly impossible
      angles. She can designate any adjacent square as the square from which flanking against an ally is determined
      (including the square where she stands, as normal). She can designate the square at the beginning of her turn or
      at any time during her turn. The designated square remains her effective square for flanking until she is no
      longer adjacent to it or until she chooses a different square (at the start of one of her turns). The character
      can even choose a square that is impassable or occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Transporter (Ex):</strong> At 6th level, an elocater learns both <i>psionic teleport</i> and
      <i>psionic plane shift</i>. These powers are in addition to any powers the elocater normally learns by advancing a
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elocater treats these powers as if they were 3rd-level powers on her class list. This means, among other
      things, that manifesting these powers costs 5 power points. (If the character does not have a high enough
      manifester level to manifest 3rd-level powers the character cannot manifest these powers until she has attained
      the required manifester level.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Capricious Step (Ex):</strong> At 7th level, an elocater can take an extra 5-foot step in any round when
      she doesn’t perform any other movement (except for the first 5-foot step). Like the first, the second 5-foot step
      does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The character can take the extra 5-foot step immediately after taking the
      first, or wait until the end of her other actions for the round. In all other ways, the rules for taking a 5-foot
      step apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dimension Spring Attack (Su):</strong> An elocater of 9th level or higher can use her dimension step
      ability in conjunction with her Spring Attack feat once per day. This ability can be used only against opponents
      within 60 feet to which the elocater has line of sight. She can dimension step up to the target, use Spring
      Attack, and then use dimension step to return to her starting point. (When she uses this ability, the total
      distance she can travel before and after the attack is not limited by her speed.) The use of this ability counts
      as her use of the dimension step ability on that day (and this ability is not available during a day when she has
      already used dimension step).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Accelerated Action (Su):</strong> When she attains 10th level, an elocater can accelerate herself and
      thereby take more actions than normal. An elocater can accelerate herself for a total of 5 rounds per day. She can
      choose to parcel out her accelerated actions in 1-round increments. (This effect is not cumulative with similar
      effects that provide additional actions, such as <i>schism</i> or a <i>haste</i> spell—and in fact an elocater
      can’t take an accelerated action if affected by these or similar effects.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If she makes a full attack while accelerated, an elocater can make one extra attack with any weapon she is
      holding. The attack is made using her full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. If
      the elocater uses her accelerated action to move, she gains an enhancement bonus to her speed of +30 feet. The
      elocater can use her accelerated action to manifest a power, as long as she has not already manifested a power in
      the current round and the one she wants to manifest has a manifesting time of 1 standard action or shorter. While
      accelerated, she gains a +2 dodge bonus on attack rolls and Reflex saves and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class. Any
      condition that makes her lose her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes her lose these dodge bonuses.

    <h3 id="psionic-fist--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are class features of the Psionic Fist prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Psionic Fists gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Monk Abilities:</strong> A Psionic Fist’s class levels stack with his monk levels for the purpose of
      determining his unarmed damage and bonuses to Armor Class and unarmored speed. His class levels do not apply to
      other monk abilities such as flurry of blows, slow fall, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Power Points/Day:</strong> A Psionic Fist can manifest powers. His ability to manifest powers is limited
      by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The Psionic
      Fist. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table: Ability
      Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and
      items. If a Psionic Fist has power points from a different class, those points are pooled together and usable to
      manifest powers from either class. Bonus power points from having a high ability score can be gained only for the
      character’s highest psionic class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powers Known:</strong> A Psionic Fist chooses his powers from the psychic warrior power list. At 1st
      level, a Psionic Fist knows one psychic warrior power of your choice. Each time he attains a new level, he learns
      one new power. A Psionic Fist can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his
      manifester level. The total number of powers a Psionic Fist can manifest per day is limited only by his daily
      power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Psionic Fist simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the
      way that some spellcasters pre pare their spells), though he must get a good night’s sleep each day to regain all
      his spent power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Difficulty Class for saving throws against Psionic Fist powers is 10 + the power’s level + the Psionic Fist’s
      Wisdom modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Maximum Power Level Known:</strong> A Psionic Fist gains the ability to learn one 1st-level power when he
      takes his first level in the prestige class. As he attains each new odd-numbered level, a Psionic Fist gains the
      ability to master more complex powers.
    </p>
    <p>To learn or manifest a power, a Psionic Fist must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the power’s level.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Psionic Feat:</strong> At 5th and 10th level, a Psionic Fist can take any psionic feat as a bonus
      feat. He must still meet the prerequisites for the feat.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Multiclass Note:</strong> A monk who becomes a Psionic Fist may continue advancing as a monk.</p>

    <h3 id="slayer--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are class features of the slayer prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Slayers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with
      all types of armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powers Known:</strong> Beginning at 2nd level, a slayer gains additional power points per day and access
      to new powers as if she had also gained a level in whatever manifesting class she belonged to before she added the
      prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus
      feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities, and so on). This essentially means that
      she adds the level of slayer to the level of whatever manifesting class the character has, then determines power
      points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character had more than one manifesting class before she became a slayer, she must decide to which class she
      adds the new level of slayer for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the character did not belong to a manifesting class before taking this prestige class, she does not gain
      manifesting levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Favored Enemy (Ex):</strong> When she enters the class, a slayer formally declares a type of psionic
      creature as the enemy she detests above all others. Due to her extensive study of her foes and training in the
      proper techniques for combating them, she gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival
      checks when using these skills against her favored enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against creatures of this kind. At 4th level the bonuses
      increase to +4, at 7th level to +6, and at 10th level to +8.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Enemy Sense (Su):</strong> A slayer can sense the presence of her favored enemy within 60 feet of herself,
      even if they are hidden by darkness or walls, but she cannot discern their exact location.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Brain Nausea (Su):</strong> At 2nd level, a slayer gains a constant defensive ability somewhat similar to
      the <i>aversion</i> power. Any creature that attempts to eat the slayer’s brain must succeed on a Will save (DC 15
      + slayer’s class level) or become disinclined to do so for 24 hours thereafter. A creature that fails this save
      may take any action it desires except extracting the slayer’s brain (but does not realize it is being so
      affected). This ability is active even if the slayer is unconscious, stunned, or otherwise helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Lucid Buffer (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a slayer becomes especially skilled at resisting mental attacks.
      She gains a +4 competence bonus on saving throws against all compulsions and mind-affecting effects. This ability
      is active even if the slayer is unconscious, stunned, or otherwise helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cerebral Blind (Su):</strong> After reaching 6th level, a slayer is protected from all devices, powers,
      and spells that reveal location. This ability protects against information gathering by clairsentience powers or
      effects that reveal location.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ability even foils
      <i>bend reality, limited wish, miracle, reality revision,</i> and <i>wish</i> when they are used to gain
      information about the slayer’s location (however, <i>metafaculty</i> can pierce this protective barrier). In the
      case of <i>remote viewing</i> or <i>scrying</i> that scans an area a slayer is in, the effect works, but the
      slayer simply isn’t detected. <i>Remote viewing</i> or <i>scrying</i> attempts that are targeted specifically at a
      slayer do not work. This ability is active as long as the slayer is psionically focused.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Breach Power Resistance (Su):</strong> A slayer of 8th level or higher can enhance her weapon with psionic
      might. Each successful melee attack (or ranged attack if the target is within 30 feet) she makes with her weapon
      against a creature with power resistance temporarily reduces its power resistance by 1. Unless the creature is
      slain, its lost power resistance returns all at once 12 hours later. This ability is active as long as the slayer
      is psionically focused.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cerebral Immunity (Su):</strong> On reaching 9th level, a slayer gains protection from all devices,
      powers, and spells that influence the mind. This ability shields her against almost all mind-affecting powers and
      effects (though the slayer can selectively allow powers or spells to affect her). The ability even foils
      <i>bend reality</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle, reality revision</i>, and <i>wish</i> when they are used to
      mentally influence a slayer. This ability is active as long as the slayer is psionically focused.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Blast Feedback (Su):</strong> At 10th level, if a slayer makes her saving throw when attacked with
      <i>mind blast,</i> the <i>mind blast</i> rebounds upon the attacker. Only the original attacker is targeted in the
      rebound effect. If the original attacker fails a Will saving throw (DC equal to that of the original attack), the
      attacker is affected normally by the <i>mind blast.</i>

    <h3 id="metamind--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are class features of the metamind prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Metaminds gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powers Known:</strong> At every even-numbered level, a metamind gains additional power points per day and
      access to new powers as if he had also gained a level in whatever manifesting class he belonged to before he added
      the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained
      (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of
      metamind to the level of whatever manifesting class the character has, then determines power points per day,
      powers known, and manifester level accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character had more than one manifesting class before he became a metamind, he must decide to which class he
      adds the new level of metamind for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Free Manifesting (Ps):</strong> At 1st level, a metamind can manifest any 1st-level power he knows for
      free (without spending power points) three times per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At higher levels, a metamind gains the ability to freely manifest additional higher-level powers: three 2nd-level
      powers per day at 3rd level; one 3rd-level power per day at 5th level; one 4th-level power per day at 7th level;
      and one 5th-level power per day at 9th level.
    </p>
    <p>
      This benefit applies only to the power point cost of an unaugmented power. Points spent to augment a power and an
      experience point cost (if any) must be paid as normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cognizance Psicrystal (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a metamind masters the trick of storing excess power
      points in a psicrystal. The psicrystal is now treated as a <i>cognizance crystal</i> capable of storing 5 power
      points, in addition to its psicrystal abilities. At every even-numbered level, a metamind becomes able to store an
      additional 2 power points in his psicrystal, to a maximum of 11 points at 8th level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Font of Power (Ps):</strong> A 10th-level metamind can act as a living
      <i>cognizance crystal,</i> producing seemingly endless power points once per day, for up to 1 minute. His eyes
      shine like tiny stars, and faint illumination seems to beam out of his mouth and the end of each of his fingers.
      While so empowered, he can manifest any of his powers without drawing from his power point reserve. He finds the
      power points he needs welling up within his own body.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a metamind using this ability enters a metaconcert, his power point reserve is accessed normally for the
      purpose of his contributing to the pool.

    <h3 id="psion-uncarnate--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are class features of the psion uncarnate prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Psion uncarnates gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powers Known:</strong> At every level indicated on Table: The Psion Uncarnate, a psion uncarnate gains
      additional power points per day and access to new powers as if he had also gained a level in whatever manifesting
      class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character
      of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities,
      and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of psion uncarnate to the level of whatever manifesting
      class the character has, then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character had more than one manifesting class before he became a psion uncarnate, he must decide to which
      class he adds the new level of psion uncarnate for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known,
      and manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Incorporeal Touch (Su):</strong> Beginning at 1st level, a psion uncarnate can make up to three melee
      touch attacks per day that each deal 1d6 points of damage if they hit. The character’s Strength modifier is not
      applied to this attack, but it is effective against incorporeal creatures (and against corporeal creatures while
      the psion uncarnate is incorporeal) The character’s hand and arm seem to become slightly translucent when he makes
      these attacks. A miss still counts as a use of the ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      While uncarnate (see below), a psion uncarnate can make melee touch attacks at will that do not count against his
      uses of this ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      For every four levels higher than 1st the psion uncarnate attains, the damage on these attacks increases by 1d6
      points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uncarnate Armor (Su):</strong> A psion uncarnate wearing armor (or using <i>inertial armor</i> or a
      similar effect) gets his armor bonus to AC even when he becomes incorporeal (see Shed Body, below). However,
      unlike other incorporeal creatures, a psion uncarnate does not gain a deflection bonus to Armor Class from his
      Charisma modifier. This ability works even if the armor being worn becomes incorporeal (such as through the use of
      the assume equipment ability described below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shed Body (Su):</strong> Starting at 2nd level, a psion uncarnate can become incorporeal (or “uncarnate”)
      once per day as a standard action. The character can remain uncarnate for up to 1 minute. During this time, the
      character’s body fades into an immaterial form that retains the character’s basic likeness. While uncarnate, the
      character gains the incorporeal subtype (see below). He gains a fly speed equal to his land speed (perfect
      maneuverability). His material armor remains in place and continues to provide its armor bonus to AC (see
      Uncarnate Armor, above). His material weapons also remain corporeal. Losing his physical form allows the character
      to more easily access his mental abilities, and he gains a +1 bonus on all save DCs for powers he manifests while
      uncarnate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He can use equipment normally, deriving benefits from items that enhance his capabilities; however, all his
      equipment remains material even when the character is uncarnate (but see the assume equipment ability, described
      below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, a psion uncarnate appears almost like a ghost wearing items of the material world. This doesn’t make his
      equipment more susceptible to attack (the normal rules for attended objects apply), but it does make it impossible
      for the character to enter or pass through solid objects while wearing solid equipment. If he drops his material
      equipment, he can pass through solid objects at will as described below.
    </p>
    <p>At 6th level and higher, a psion uncarnate can shed his body twice per day for up to 1 minute each time.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Incorporeal Subtype:</em> An incorporeal psion uncarnate has no physical body. He can be harmed only by other
      incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities,
      or supernatural abilities. He is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons,
      he has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy,
      force effects, or attacks made with <i>ghost touch</i> weapons).
    </p>
    <p>
      An incorporeal psion uncarnate has no natural armor bonus—and, unlike other incorporeal creatures, does not gain a
      deflection bonus from his Charisma modifier. An incorporeal psion uncarnate can enter or pass through solid
      objects (subject to the restrictions described in the shed body and assume equipment abilities), but must remain
      adjacent to the object’s exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than his
      own. He can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to his current location, but
      enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal psion uncarnate that is inside an object. To
      see farther from the object he is in and attack normally, the incorporeal psion uncarnate must emerge. An
      incorporeal psion uncarnate inside an object has total cover, but when he attacks a creature outside the object he
      only has cover, so a creature outside with a readied action could strike at him as he attacks. An incorporeal
      psion uncarnate cannot pass through a force effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      An incorporeal psion uncarnate’s attacks pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although
      deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against him. He can pass through and operate in water as easily
      as he does in air. An incorporeal psion uncarnate cannot fall or take falling damage. He cannot make trip or
      grapple attacks, nor can he be tripped or grappled. In fact, he cannot take any physical action that would move or
      manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor is he subject to such actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight. An incorporeal
      creature moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn’t wish to be. It has no Strength score,
      so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attack rolls and its ranged attack rolls. Nonvisual senses,
      such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal
      creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when they
      cannot see.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assume Equipment (Su):</strong> Beginning at 3rd level, a psion</p>
    <p>
      uncarnate can designate a number of pieces of his worn equipment (including armor and weapons) equal to his psion
      uncarnate level to become incorporeal when he uses his shed body ability. This has no effect on the equipment’s
      function, but now when the psion uncarnate is incorporeal, he can enter or pass through solid objects while
      wearing nothing other than the designated equipment. Once designated, the equipment automatically changes to
      incorporeal when the character sheds his body, and it returns to corporeality when the character does. The
      character can change his designations as he desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Assume Likeness (Su):</strong> At 4th level and higher, while incorporeal, a psion uncarnate can assume
      the likeness of any Small, Medium, or Large creature as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity. The character’s abilities do not change, but he appears to be the creature that he assumes the
      likeness of, allowing him the ability to effectively disguise himself and bluff those who might wonder at his true
      nature. Each physical interaction with a creature requires a successful Bluff check (opposed by the creature’s
      Sense Motive check) to convince the creature of the psion uncarnate’s new appearance. The psion uncarnate must not
      do anything to give away his true (incorporeal) nature in order for the bluff to be successful; for instance, if
      he accepts an item from another creature only to have it fall through his immaterial hands, the Bluff check
      automatically fails. However, a Bluff check would be allowed if the psion uncarnate uses his telekinetic force
      ability (see below) to hold the received item.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using his assume likeness ability, a psion uncarnate has an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise
      checks. If he can read an opponent’s mind, he gets a further +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Telekinetic Force (Su):</strong> Beginning at 7th level, while incorporeal, a psion uncarnate can use a
      telekinetic force effect as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The save DC is equal
      to 14 + the psion uncarnate’s key ability modifier (either Int, Wis, or Cha). The character’s manifester level is
      the manifester level of the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even while corporeal, a psion uncarnate can use this ability, but only three times per day (uses while he is
      uncarnate do not count against this use limit).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uncarnate Bridge (Su):</strong> At 8th level, as a creature of almost pure mind, a psion uncarnate becomes
      more closely attuned to the minds of other creatures. He gains the ability to transport himself via the minds of
      living creatures. Once per day as a standard action while incorporeal, he can seamlessly enter any living creature
      with an Intelligence score and pass to another living creature with an Intelligence score that is within line of
      sight of the first creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The psion uncarnate must be in a space adjacent to the entry creature before transporting, and he appears in a
      space adjacent to the destination creature after transporting. The entry and destination creatures need not be
      familiar to the character. A psion uncarnate cannot use himself as the entry or destination creature. Neither
      creature need be a willing participant.
    </p>
    <p>
      When exiting the destination creature, the psion uncarnate chooses an adjacent square in which to appear. Entering
      and leaving a creature is painless, unless the psion uncarnate wishes otherwise (see below). In most cases,
      though, the destination creature finds being the endpoint of a mental bridge surprising and quite unsettling.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he desires, a psion uncarnate can destructively exit the destination creature. If the creature fails a Will
      save (DC 15 + psion uncarnate’s key ability modifier), the exiting psion uncarnate tunes his mental form to
      destructively interfere with the target’s mind. He bursts forth explosively from the creature’s body, dealing it
      10d6 points of damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uncarnate (Ex):</strong> At 10th level, a psion uncarnate becomes a being of pure psionic consciousness.
      This ability is similar to shed body, except the character is permanently incorporeal (and gains that subtype). If
      the character desires, he can become corporeal once per day for up to 1 minute, but he spends the rest of his time
      as an entity of mind untethered by the physical world.

    <h3 id="pyrokineticist--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are class features of the pyrokineticist prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Pyrokineticists gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Fire Lash</i> (Ps):</strong> A pyrokineticist gains the ability to fashion a 15-foot-long whip of fire
      from unstable ectoplasm as a move-equivalent action. She takes no damage from a fire lash she creates, and if she
      releases her hold, it immediately dissipates. The lash deals 1d8 points of fire damage to a target within 15 feet
      on a successful ranged touch attack. A pyro can take Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization (if she otherwise
      meets the prerequisites) in conjunction with the fire lash, as well as any feats that apply to the use of a
      standard whip. The whip remains in existence as long as the pyrokineticist holds it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fire Adaptation (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a pyrokineticist becomes resistant to fire, gaining a +4
      bonus on all saving throws against fire and heat spells and effects. In addition, she gains resistance to fire 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Hand Afire</i> (Ps):</strong> A pyrokineticist of 2nd level or higher can activate this ability as a
      move-equivalent action. Flames engulf one of the pyrokineticist’s hands (but do her no harm). Her unarmed attacks
      with that hand are treated as armed. Such attacks deal an extra 2d6 points of fire damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Bolt of Fire</i> (Ps):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, as a standard action, a pyrokineticist can
      launch a bolt of psionically manifested fire at any target in line of sight within 60 feet. This effect is treated
      as a ranged touch attack and deals 1d6 points of fire damage for each class level the pyro has.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Weapon Afire</i> (Ps):</strong> At 4th level and higher, a pyrokineticist can activate this ability as
      a move-equivalent action. Flames that harm neither her nor the weapon engulf one weapon she holds (which can be a
      projectile such as a stone, bullet, arrow, or bolt). The weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of fire damage on a
      successful hit. The weapon retains this effect for as long as the pyrokineticist wields it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Nimbus</i> (Ps):</strong> Beginning at 5th level, a pyrokineticist can activate this ability as a
      move-equivalent action. Flames that harm neither the pyrokineticist nor her equipment engulf her entire body.
      While she is aflame, the character’s Charisma score increases by 4, she can make a melee touch attack for 2d6
      points of fire damage, and she gains damage reduction 5/magic. If she is struck in melee, the attacker takes 2d6
      points of fire damage. This ability lasts for up to 1 minute per pyrokineticist level and is usable once per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Firewalk (Su):</strong> Beginning at 6th level, as a free action a pyrokineticist can expend her psionic
      focus (see the Concentration skill description) to literally walk on air. She moves at her normal speed in all
      directions, including vertically, but cannot move more than double her speed in a round. A firewalking pyro leaves
      footprints of flame in the air that disperse in 2 rounds, but her tread does not deal damage. She must pay 1 power
      point per round spent traveling in this fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fear No Fire (Ex):</strong> At 7th level, a pyrokineticist becomes highly resistant to fire, gaining a +8
      bonus on all saving throws against fire and heat spells and effects and also gaining resistance to fire 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Greater Weapon Afire</i> (Ps):</strong> At 8th level, when a pyrokineticist activates her hand afire
      ability or her weapon afire ability, her unarmed attack or weapon deals an extra 4d6 points of fire damage instead
      of 2d6. Touch attacks made while she uses the nimbus ability likewise deal 4d6 points of damage instead of 2d6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Heat Death</i> (Ps):</strong> A pyrokineticist who reaches 9th level can expend her psionic focus and
      take a full attack action to raise the internal temperature of one living creature within 30 feet to lethal
      levels. The target must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw (DC 14 + pyro’s Cha modifier) or die horrifically as
      its blood (or other internal fluid) boils. Even on a successful save, the target takes 4d8 points of fire damage
      from the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Conflagration</i> (Ps):</strong> At 10th level, a pyrokineticist gains the ability to create a massive
      burst of raging flames around herself, burning everything in the area. Once per day, as a standard action, she can
      use this ability to deal 15d6 points of fire damage in a 30-foot-radius burst emanating from herself. Any creature
      or object caught in the burst can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 15 + pyro’s Cha modifier) for half damage. Anyone
      failing the Reflex save against the <i>conflagration</i> must also make a Fortitude saving throw (same DC) or die
      due to extreme shock from the intense heat.

    <h3 id="thrallherd--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are class features of the thrallherd prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Thrallherds gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powers Known:</strong> At every level from 2nd through 9th, a thrallherd gains additional power points per
      day and access to new powers as if she had also gained a level in whatever manifesting class she belonged to
      before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would
      have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities, and so on). This
      essentially means that she adds the level of thrallherd to the level of whatever manifesting class the character
      has, then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character had more than one manifesting class before she became a thrallherd, she must decide to which class
      she adds the new level of thrallherd for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and
      manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Thrallherd (Ex):</strong> A thrallherd who has just entered the class sends out a subtle psychic call for
      servants, and that call is answered. Essentially, the character gains something akin to the Leadership feat, but
      with some important differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who answer a thrallherd’s call are not referred to as cohorts and followers, but rather as thralls and
      believers, respectively. They do not appear because they admire the character and want to serve her, but because a
      hidden psychic resonance connects the thrallherd and her servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with the Leadership feat, a thrallherd has a Leadership score that determines the highest-level thrall and
      believers she can attract. A thrallherd’s Leadership score is equal to her character level + her Cha modifier +
      her thrallherd level. (Note that her thrallherd level is counted twice.) This score is not affected by any of the
      modifiers mentioned in the Leadership feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with the Leadership feat, the called thrall’s level is limited, even if the character’s Leadership score would
      indicate a higher-level thrall. Unlike with the Leadership feat, the level limit of a thrall is equal to the
      character’s total level minus 1 (not level minus 2, as is true for cohorts).
    </p>
    <p>
      A thrallherd cannot take the Leadership feat; if the character already has it, the feat is lost and replaced by
      this ability; those who were previously cohorts and followers go their separate ways, and those who are more
      mentally pliable show up later to take up roles as thralls and believers. A thrallherd’s first thrall and
      believers arrive within 24 hours of her entry into this class; likewise, lost thralls and believers are replaced
      within 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the following table instead of the one with the Leadership feat to determine the level of a thrallherd’s
      thrall and the number of believers of various levels a thrallherd can attract.

      <strong>Psionic Charm (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a thrallherd adds <i>psionic charm</i> to her powers known (if
      she doesn’t already know it). Once per day, she can manifest <i>psionic charm</i> at a reduced power point cost.
      The cost of <i>psionic charm</i> is reduced by the thrallherd’s level, to a minimum of 1 power point. The effect
      of this power is still restricted by the thrallherd’s manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psionic Dominate (Ex):</strong> At 5th level, a thrallherd adds <i>psionic dominate</i> to her powers
      known (if she doesn’t already know it) Once per day, she can manifest <i>psionic dominate</i> at a reduced power
      point cost. The cost of <i>psionic dominate</i> is reduced by the thrallherd’s level, to a minimum of 1 power
      point. The effect of this power is still restricted by the thrallherd’s manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Greater Dominate (Ex):</strong> At 7th level and higher, a thrallherd does not have to pay 2 additional
      power points when she augments <i>psionic dominate</i> to affect animals, fey, giants, magical beasts, and
      monstrous humanoids. This reduced point cost does not increase the save DC of the power as if she had spent the
      additional power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Superior Dominate (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a thrallherd does not have to pay 4 additional power points
      when she augments <i>psionic dominate</i> to affect aberrations, dragons, elementals, and outsiders (in addition
      to the creature types mentioned in the greater dominate ability). This reduced point cost does not increase the
      save DC of the power as if she had spent the additional power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Twofold Master (Ex):</strong> At 10th level, a thrallherd can add a second thrall to her herd. This second
      thrall’s maximum level is equal to the thrallherd’s level minus 2, even if her Leadership score would indicate a
      higher-level thrall.

    <h3 id="war-mind--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are class features of the war mind prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> War minds gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Power Points/Day:</strong> A war mind can manifest powers. His ability to manifest powers is limited by
      the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The War Mind. In
      addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Wisdom score. His race may also provide bonus
      power points per day, as may certain feats and items. If a war mind has power points from a different class, those
      points are pooled together and usable to manifest powers from either class. Bonus power points from having a high
      ability score can be gained only for the character’s highest psionic class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powers Known:</strong> A war mind chooses his powers from the psychic warrior power list. At 1st level, a
      war mind knows one psychic warrior power of your choice. At every even-numbered level higher than 1st, he learns
      one new power. A war mind can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester
      level. The total number of powers a war mind can manifest per day is limited only by his daily power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      A war mind simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way
      that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night’s sleep each day to regain all his
      spent power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Difficulty Class for saving throws against war mind powers is 10 + the power’s level + the war mind’s Wisdom
      modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Maximum Power Level Known:</strong> A war mind gains the ability to learn one 1st-level power when he
      takes his first level in the prestige class. As he attains each even-numbered level beyond 2nd, a war mind gains
      the ability to master more complex powers.
    </p>
    <p>To learn or manifest a power, a war mind must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the power’s level.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Chain of Personal Superiority (Ex):</strong> At 1st level, a war mind learns the first principle of
      warfare for the individual combatant: the ability to both deal punishment and take it. Calling upon inner reserves
      of knowledge and dedication, a war mind can provide himself with a +2 insight bonus to Strength and Constitution
      for up to 1 minute. A war mind can use this power three times per day. Activating this power is a free action. At
      7th level, the insight bonus to Strength and Constitution improves to +4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Chain of Defensive Posture (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a war mind learns the second principle of warfare
      for the individual combatant: the ability to avoid the enemy’s counterattacks if that enemy is not immediately
      overwhelmed. Calling upon inner reserves of knowledge and dedication, a war mind can provide himself with a +2
      insight bonus to Armor Class for up to 1 minute. A war mind can use this power three times per day. Activating
      this power is a free action. At 8th level, the insight bonus to Armor Class improves to +4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Enduring Body (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a war mind learns the third principle of warfare for the
      individual combatant: to unleash in oneself the spirit of the enduring body. The spirit of the ideal body
      transforms a war mind, granting him damage reduction 1/–. At 6th level, his damage reduction improves to 2/–. At
      9th level, his damage reduction improves to 3/–.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sweeping Strike (Ex):</strong> At 5th level, a war mind gains the ability to make great, sweeping swings
      with a melee weapon. On each melee attack a war mind makes, he can choose squares he threatens that are adjacent
      to each other, and his attacks apply to creatures in those two squares equally. A war mind can use this ability on
      any attack, even an attack of opportunity or a cleave attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      A war mind cannot use this ability if he has moved more than 10 feet since the end of his last turn. If a war mind
      drops one or both of his foes with a sweeping strike, he can attempt a cleave normally; however, he makes only one
      cleave attempt per sweeping strike, even if he drops more than one foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Chain of Overwhelming Force (Su):</strong> At 10th level, a war mind learns the fourth principle of
      warfare for the individual combatant: to discover the underlying violence of the world and deliver it in a
      perfectly executed attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war mind taps into this underlying energy and apply it to a single attack, dealing an extra 10d6 points of
      damage. A war mind can use this power once per day. Activating this power is a free action. If the attack misses,
      the power is wasted.
