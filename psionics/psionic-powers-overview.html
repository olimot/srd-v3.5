    <h1>PSIONIC POWERS OVERVIEW</h1>
    <p>
      Psionic powers spring from sentient minds. Even an undead creature or a being that has no physical form can create
      a reserve of inner strength necessary to manifest powers, as long as it has an Intelligence score of at least 1.
      Vermin possessed of a hive mind ability are an exception to this rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      A psionic power is a one-time psionic effect. Psionic characters and creatures need not prepare their powers for
      use ahead of time. They either have sufficient power points to manifest a power or they do not.
    </p>
    <p>
      A power is manifested when a psionic character pays its power point cost. Some psionic creatures automatically
      manifest powers, called psi-like abilities, without paying a power point cost. Other creatures pay power points to
      manifest their powers, just as characters do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each power has a specific effect. A power known to a psionic character can be used whenever he or she has power
      points to pay for it.

    <h2 id="manifesting-powers">Manifesting Powers</h2>
    <p>
      Psionic characters and creatures manifest powers. Whether they cost power points when manifest by a psionic
      character, or are manifested as psi-like abilities, powers’ effects remain the same. The process of manifesting a
      power is akin to casting a spell, but with significant differences.
    </p>
    <h2 id="choosing-a-power">Choosing a Power</h2>
    <p>
      First you must choose which power to manifest. You can select any power you know, provided you are capable of
      manifesting powers of that level or higher. To manifest a power, you must pay power points, which count against
      your daily total. You can manifest the same power multiple times if you have points left to pay for it.
    </p>
    <h2 id="concentration">Concentration</h2>
    <p>
      To manifest a power, you must concentrate. If something threatens to interrupt your concentration while you’re
      manifesting a power, you must succeed on a Concentration check or lose the power points without manifesting the
      power. The more distracting the interruption and the higher the level of the power that you are trying to
      manifest, the higher the DC. (Higher-level powers require more mental effort.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Injury:</strong> Getting hurt or being affected by hostile psionics while trying to manifest a power can
      break your concentration and ruin a power. If you take damage while trying to manifest a power, you must make a
      Concentration check (DC 10 + points of damage taken + the level of the power you’re manifesting). The interrupting
      event strikes during manifestation if it occurs between when you start and when you complete manifesting a power
      (for a power with a manifesting time of 1 round or longer) or if it comes in response to your manifesting the
      power (such as an attack of opportunity provoked by the manifesting of the power or a contingent attack from a
      readied action).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are taking continuous damage half the damage is considered to take place while you are manifesting a power.
      You must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 the damage that the continuous source last dealt + the level of
      the power you’re manifesting).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the last damage dealt was the last damage that the effect could deal then the damage is over, and it does not
      distract you.
    </p>
    <p>Repeated damage does not count as continuous damage.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Power:</strong> If you are affected by a power while attempting to manifest a power of your own, you must
      make a Concentration check or lose the power you are manifesting. If the power affecting you deals damage, the
      Concentration DC is 10 + points of damage + the level of the power you’re manifesting. If the power interferes
      with you or distracts you in some other way, the Concentration DC is the power’s save DC + the level of the power
      you’re manifesting. For a power with no saving throw, it’s the DC that the power’s saving throw would have if a
      save were allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Grappling or Pinned:</strong> To manifest a power while grappling or pinned, you must make a Concentration
      check (DC 20 + the level of the power you’re manifesting) or lose the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Vigorous Motion:</strong> If you are riding on a moving mount, taking a bouncy ride in a wagon, on a small
      boat in rough water, belowdecks in a storm-tossed ship, or simply being jostled in a similar fashion, you must
      make a Concentration check (DC 10 + the level of the power you’re manifesting) or lose the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Violent Motion:</strong> If you are on a galloping horse, taking a very rough ride in a wagon, on a small
      boat in rapids or in a storm, on deck in a storm-tossed ship, or being tossed roughly about in a similar fashion,
      you must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the power you’re manifesting) or lose the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Violent Weather:</strong> If you are in a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet, the DC is 5 + the
      level of the power you’re manifesting. If you are in wind-driven hail, dust, or debris, the DC is 10 + the level
      of the power you’re manifesting. In either case, you lose the power if you fail the Concentration check. If the
      weather is caused by a power, use the rules in the Power subsection above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Manifesting Powers on the Defensive:</strong> If you want to manifest a power without provoking attacks of
      opportunity, you need to dodge and weave. You must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the power
      you’re manifesting) to succeed. You lose the power points without successful manifestation if you fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Entangled:</strong> If you want to manifest a power while entangled in a net or while affected by a power
      with similar effects you must make a DC 15 Concentration check to manifest the power. You lose the power if you
      fail.
    </p>
    <h2 id="manifester-level">Manifester Level</h2>
    <p>
      The variables of a power’s effect often depend on its manifester level, which is equal to your psionic class
      level. A power that can be augmented for additional effect is also limited by your manifester level (you can’t
      spend more power points on a power than your manifester level). See Augment under Descriptive Text, below.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can manifest a power at a lower manifester level than normal, but the manifester level must be high enough for
      you to manifest the power in question, and all level-dependent features must be based on the same manifester
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event that a class feature or other special ability provides an adjustment to your manifester level, this
      adjustment applies not only to all effects based on manifester level (such as range, duration, and augmentation
      potential) but also to your manifester level check to overcome your target’s power resistance and to the
      manifester level used in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC of the check).
    </p>
    <h2 id="power-failure">Power Failure</h2>
    <p>
      If you try to manifest a power in conditions where the characteristics of the power (range, area, and so on)
      cannot be made to conform, the manifestation fails and the power points are wasted.
    </p>
    <p>Powers also fail if your concentration is broken (see Concentration, above).</p>
    <h2 id="the-powers-result">The Power’s Result</h2>
    <p>
      Once you know which creatures (or objects or areas) are affected, and whether those creatures have made successful
      saving throws (if any were allowed), you can apply whatever results a power entails.
    </p>
    <h2 id="special-power-effects">Special Power Effects</h2>
    <p>Certain special features apply to all powers.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Attacks:</strong> Some powers refer to attacking. All offensive combat actions, even those that don’t
      damage opponents, such as disarm and bull rush, are considered attacks. All powers that opponents can resist with
      saving throws, that deal damage, or that otherwise harm or hamper subjects are considered attacks.
      <i>Astral construct</i> and similar powers are not considered attacks because the powers themselves don’t harm
      anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Types:</strong> Many powers give creatures bonuses to ability scores, Armor Class, attacks, and
      other attributes. Each bonus has a type that indicates how the power grants the bonus. The important aspect of
      bonus types is that two bonuses of the same type don’t generally stack. With the exception of dodge bonuses, most
      circumstance bonuses, and racial bonuses, only the better bonus works (see Combining Psionic and Magical Effects,
      below). The same principle applies to penalties—a character taking two or more penalties of the same type applies
      only the worst one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bringing Back the Dead:</strong> Of all the psionic powers, only <i>reality revision</i> has the ability
      to restore slain characters to life. When a living creature dies, its soul departs the body, leaves the Material
      Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature’s deity resides. If the
      creature did not worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. Bringing someone
      back from the dead means retrieving his or her soul and returning it to his or her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Level Loss:</em> The passage from life to death and back again is a wrenching journey for a being’s soul.
      Consequently, any creature brought back to life usually loses one level of experience. The character’s new
      experience point total is midway between the minimum needed for his or her new (reduced) level and the minimum
      needed for the next one. If the character was 1st level at the time of death, he or she loses 2 points of
      Constitution instead of losing a level. This level loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any mortal
      means, even the spells <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i>. A revived character can regain a lost level by earning XP
      through further adventuring. A revived character who was 1st level at the time of death can regain lost points of
      Constitution by improving his or her Constitution score when he or she attains a level that allows an ability
      score increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Preventing Revivif cation:</em> Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be
      returned from the dead. Keeping the body prevents others from using a single manifestation of
      <i>reality revision</i> to restore the slain character to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Revivif cation Against One’s Will:</em> A soul cannot be returned to life if it does not wish to be. A soul
      knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and may refuse to
      return on that basis.
    </p>
    <h2 id="combining-psionic-and-magical-effects">Combining Psionic and Magical Effects</h2>
    <p>
      The default rule for the interaction of psionics and magic is simple: Powers interact with spells and spells
      interact with powers in the same way a spell or normal spell-like ability interacts with another spell or
      spell-like ability. This is known as psionics–magic transparency.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psionics–Magic Transparency:</strong> Though not explicitly called out in the spell descriptions or magic
      item descriptions, spells, spell-like abilities, and magic items that could potentially affect psionics do affect
      psionics.
    </p>
    <p>When the rule about psionics–magic transparency is in effect, it has the following ramifications.</p>
    <p>
      Spell resistance is effective against powers, using the same mechanics. Likewise, power resistance is effective
      against spells, using the same mechanics as spell resistance. If a creature has one kind of resistance, it is
      assumed to have the other. (The effects have similar ends despite having been brought about by different means.)
    </p>
    <p>
      All spells that dispel magic have equal effect against powers of the same level using the same mechanics, and vice
      versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell <i>detect magic</i> detects powers, their number, and their strength and location within 3 rounds
      (though a Psicraft check is necessary to identify the discipline of the psionic aura).
    </p>
    <p>Dead magic areas are also dead psionics areas.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Multiple Effects:</strong> Powers or psionic effects usually work as described no matter how many other
      powers, psionic effects, spells, or magical effects happen to be operating in the same area or on the same
      recipient. Except in special cases, a power does not affect the way another power or spell operates. Whenever a
      power has a specific effect on other powers or spells, the power description explains the effect (and vice versa
      for spells that affect powers). Several other general rules apply when powers, spells, magical effects, or psionic
      effects operate in the same place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Stacking Effects:</strong> Powers that provide bonuses or penalties on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving
      throws, and other attributes usually do not stack with themselves. More generally, two bonuses of the same type
      don’t stack even if they come from different powers, or one from a power and one from a spell. You use whichever
      bonus gives you the better result.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Different Bonus Types</i>: The bonuses or penalties from two different powers, or a power and a spell, stack if
      the effects are of different types. A bonus that isn’t named (just a “+2 bonus” rather than a “+2 insight bonus”)
      stacks with any bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Same Effect More than Once in Different Strengths</i>: In cases when two or more similar or identical effects
      are operating in the same area or on the same target, but at different strengths, only the best one applies. If
      one power or spell is dispelled or its duration runs out, the other power or spell remains in effect (assuming its
      duration has not yet expired).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Same Effect with Differing Results</i>: The same power or spell can sometimes produce varying effects if
      applied to the same recipient more than once. The last effect in a series trumps the others. None of the previous
      spells or powers are actually removed or dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell or
      power in the series lasts.
    </p>
    <p><em>One Effect Makes Another Irrelevant:</em> Sometimes, a power can render another power irrelevant.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Multiple Mental Control Effects</i>: Sometimes psionic or magical effects that establish mental control render
      one another irrelevant. Mental controls that don’t remove the recipient’s ability to act usually do not interfere
      with one another, though one may modify another. If a creature is under the control of two or more creatures, it
      tends to obey each to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If the
      controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers must make opposed
      Charisma checks to determine which one the creature obeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powers and Spells with Opposite Effects:</strong> Powers and spells with opposite effects apply normally,
      with all bonuses, penalties, or changes accruing in the order that they apply. Some powers and spells negate or
      counter each other. This is a special effect that is noted in a power’s or spell’s description.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Instantaneous Effects:</strong> Two or more magical or psionic effects with instantaneous durations work
      cumulatively when they affect the same object, place, or creature.
    </p>
    <h2 id="powers-and-power-points">Powers and Power Points</h2>
    <p>
      Psionic characters manifest powers, which involve the direct manipulation of personal mental energy. These
      manipulations require natural talent and personal meditation. A psionic character’s level limits the number of
      power points available to manifest powers. A psionic character’s relevant high score might allow him to gain extra
      power points. He can manifest the same power more than once, but each manifestation subtracts power points from
      his daily limit. Manifesting a power is an arduous mental task. To do so, a psionic character must have a key
      ability score of at least 10 + the power’s level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Daily Power Point Acquisition:</strong> To regain used daily power points, a psionic character must have a
      clear mind. To clear his mind, he must first sleep for 8 hours. The character does not have to slumber for every
      minute of the time, but he must refrain from movement, combat, manifesting powers, skill use, conversation, or any
      other demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If his rest is interrupted, each interruption adds
      1 hour to the total amount of time he has to rest to clear his mind, and he must have at least 1 hour of rest
      immediately prior to regaining lost power points. If the character does not need to sleep for some reason, he
      still must have 8 hours of restful calm before regaining power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Recent Manifesting Limit/Rest Interruptions:</strong> If a psionic character has manifested powers
      recently, the drain on his resources reduces his capacity to regain power points. When he regains power points for
      the coming day, all power points he has used within the last 8 hours count against his daily limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Peaceful Environment:</strong> To regain power points, a psionic character must have enough peace, quiet,
      and comfort to allow for proper concentration. The psionic character’s surroundings need not be luxurious, but
      they must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. Exposure to
      inclement weather prevents the necessary concentration, as does any injury or failed saving throw the character
      might incur while concentrating on regaining power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Regaining Power Points:</strong> Once the character has rested in a suitable environment, it takes only an
      act of concentration spanning 1 full round to regain all power points of the psionic character’s daily limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Death and Power Points:</strong> If a character dies, all daily power points stored in his mind are wiped
      away. A potent effect (such as <i>reality revision</i>) can recover the lost power points when it recovers the
      character.
    </p>
    <h3 id="adding-powers">Adding Powers</h3>
    <p>
      Psionic characters can learn new powers when they attain a new level. A psion can learn any power from the
      psion/wilder list and powers from his chosen discipline’s list. A wilder can learn any power from the psion/wilder
      list. A psychic warrior can learn any power from the psychic warrior list.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powers Gained at a New Level:</strong> Psions and other psionic characters perform a certain amount of
      personal meditation between adventures in an attempt to unlock latent mental abilities. Each time a psionic
      character attains a new level, he or she learns additional powers according to his class description. Psions,
      psychic warriors, and wilders learn new powers of their choice in this fashion. These powers represent abilities
      unlocked from latency. The powers must be of levels the characters can manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Independent Research:</strong> A psion also can research a power independently, duplicating an existing
      power or creating an entirely new one. If characters are allowed to develop new powers, use these guidelines to
      handle the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any kind of manifester can create a new power. The research involved requires access to a retreat conducive to
      uninterrupted meditation. Research involves an expenditure of 200 XP per week and takes one week per level of the
      power. At the end of that time, the character makes a Psicraft check (DC 10 + spell level). If that check
      succeeds, the character learns the new power if her research produced a viable power. If the check fails, the
      character must go through the research process again if she wants to keep trying.
    </p>
    <h4 id="manifest-an-unknown-power-from-anothers-powers-known">
      Manifest an Unknown Power From Another’s Powers Known
    </h4>
    <p>
      A psionic character can attempt to manifest a power from a source other than his own knowledge (usually a power
      stone or another willing psionic character). To do so, the character must first make contact (a process similar to
      addressing a power stone, requiring a Psicraft check against a DC of 15+ the level of the power to be manifested).
      A psionic character can make contact with only a willing psionic character or creature (unconscious creatures are
      considered willing, but not psionic characters under the effects of other immobilizing conditions). Characters who
      can’t use power stones for any reason are also banned from attempting to manifest powers from the knowledge of
      other psionic characters. Mental contact requires 1 full round of physical contact, which can provoke attacks of
      opportunity. Once contact is achieved, the character becomes aware of all the powers stored in the power stone or
      all the powers the other character knows up to the highest level of power the contactor knows himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, the psionic character must choose one of the powers and make a second Psicraft check (DC 15 + the power’s
      level) to see if he understands it. If the power is not on his class list, he automatically fails this check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon successfully making contact with another willing psionic character or creature and learning what he can of
      one power in particular, the character can immediately attempt to manifest that power even if he doesn’t know it
      (and assuming he has power points left for the day). He can attempt to manifest the power normally on his next
      turn, and he succeeds if he makes one additional Psicraft check (DC 15 + the power’s level). He retains the
      ability to manifest the selected power for only 1 round. If he doesn’t manifest the power, fails the Psicraft
      check, or manifests a different power, he loses his chance to manifest that power for the day.
    </p>
    <h3 id="using-stored-power-points">Using Stored Power Points</h3>
    <p>
      A variety of psionic items exist to store power points for later use, in particular a storage device called a
      <i>cognizance crystal</i>. Regardless of what sort of item stores the power points, all psionic characters must
      follow strict rules when tapping stored power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>A Single Source:</strong> When using power points from a storage item to manifest a power, a psionic
      character may not pay the power’s cost with power points from more than one source. He must either use an item,
      his own power point reserve, or some other discrete power point source to pay the manifestation cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Recharging:</strong> Most power point storage devices allow psionic characters to “recharge” the item with
      their own power points. Doing this depletes the character’s power point reserve on a 1-for-1 basis as if he had
      manifested a power; however, those power points remain indefinitely stored. The opposite is not true—psionic
      characters may not use power points stored in a storage item to replenish their own power point reserves.
    </p>
    <h2 id="special-abilities">Special Abilities</h2>
    <p>
      Psionic creatures can create psionic effects without having levels in a psionic class (although they can take a
      psionic class to further enhance their abilities); such creatures have the psionic subtype.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters using dorjes, <i>cognizance crystals,</i> and other psionic items can also create psionic effects. In
      addition to existing spell-like and supernatural abilities, creatures can also have psi-like abilities. (Psionic
      creatures may also have extraordinary and natural abilities.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psi-Like Abilities (Ps):</strong> The manifestation of powers by a psionic character is considered a
      psi-like ability, as is the manifestation of powers by creatures without a psionic class (creatures with the
      psionic subtype, also simply called psionic creatures). Usually, a psionic creature’s psi-like ability works just
      like the power of that name. A few psi-like abilities are unique; these are explained in the text where they are
      described.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psi-like abilities have no verbal, somatic, or material components, nor do they require a focus or have an XP cost
      (even if the equivalent power has an XP cost). The user activates them mentally. Armor never affects a psi-like
      ability’s use. A psi-like ability has a manifesting time of 1 standard action unless noted otherwise in the
      ability description. In all other ways, a psi-like ability functions just like a power. However, a psionic
      creature does not have to pay a psi-like ability’s power point cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psi-like abilities are subject to power resistance and to being dispelled by <i>dispel psionics</i>. They do not
      function in areas where psionics is suppressed or negated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Supernatural Abilities:</strong> Some creatures have psionic abilities that are considered supernatural.
      Psionic feats are also supernatural abilities. These abilities cannot be disrupted in combat, as powers can be,
      and do not provoke attacks of opportunity (except as noted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not
      subject to power resistance and cannot be negated or dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where
      psionics is suppressed.
    </p>
    <h2 id="psionic-maladies">Psionic Maladies</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Burn:</strong> This is a special form of ability damage that cannot be magically or psionically
      healed. It is caused by the use of certain psionic feats and powers. It returns only through natural healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Disease, Cascade Flu:</strong> Spread by brain moles and other vermin; injury; DC 13; incubation one day;
      damage psionic cascade.
    </p>
    <p>
      A psionic cascade is a loss of control over psionic abilities. Using power points becomes dangerous for a
      character infected by cascade flu, once the incubation period has run its course. Every time an afflicted
      character manifests a power, she must make a DC 16 Concentration check. On a failed check, a psionic cascade is
      triggered. The power operates normally, but during the following round, without the character’s volition, two
      additional powers she knows manifest randomly, and their power cost is deducted from the character’s reserve.
      During the next round, three additional powers manifest, and so on, until all the psionic character’s power points
      are drained. Powers with a range of personal or touch always affect the diseased character. For other powers that
      affect targets, roll d%: On a 01–50 result, the power affects the diseased character, and 51–00 indicates that the
      power targets other creatures in the vicinity. Psionic creatures (those that manifest their powers without paying
      points) cascade until all the powers they know have manifested at least twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with any disease, a psionic character who is injured or attacked by a creature carrying a disease or parasite,
      or who otherwise has contact with contaminated material, must make an immediate Fortitude save. On a success, the
      disease fails to gain a foothold. On a failure, the character takes damage (or incurs the specified effect) after
      the incubation period. Once per day afterward, the afflicted character must make a successful Fortitude save to
      avoid repeating the damage. Two successful saving throws in a row indicate she has fought off the disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Disease, Cerebral Parasites:</strong> Spread by contact with infected psionic creatures; contact; DC 15;
      incubation 1d4 days; damage 1d8 power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cerebral parasites are tiny organisms, undetectable to normal sight. An afflicted character may not even know he
      carries the parasites—until he discovers he has fewer power points for the day than expected. Psionic creatures
      with cerebral parasites are limited to using each of their known powers only once per day (instead of freely
      manifesting them). See the note about diseases under Cascade Flu, above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Negative Levels:</strong> Psionic characters can gain negative levels just like members of other character
      classes. A psionic character loses access to one power per negative level from the highest level of power he can
      manifest; he also loses a number of power points equal to the cost of that power. If two or more powers fit these
      criteria, the manifester decides which one becomes inaccessible. The lost power becomes available again as soon
      the negative level is removed, providing the manifester is capable of using it at that time. Lost power points
      also return.
    </p>
    <h2 id="power-descriptions">Power Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
      The description of each power is presented in a standard format. Each category of information is explained and
      defined below.
    </p>
    <h3 id="name">Name</h3>
    <p>
      The first line of every power description gives the name by which the power is generally known. A power might be
      known by other names in some locales, and specific manifesters might have names of their own for their powers.
    </p>
    <h3 id="discipline">Discipline (Subdiscipline)</h3>
    <p>
      Beneath the power name is a line giving the discipline (and the subdiscipline in parentheses, if appropriate) that
      the power belongs to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every power is associated with one of six disciplines. A discipline is a group of related powers that work in
      similar ways. Each of the disciplines is discussed below.
    </p>
    <h3 id="clairsentience">Clairsentience</h3>
    <p>
      Clairsentience powers enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to glimpse the immediate future and predict the
      far future, to find hidden objects, and to know what is normally unknowable.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purpose of psionics–magic transparency, clairsentience powers are equivalent to powers of the divination
      school (thus, creatures immune to divination spells are also immune to clairsentience powers).
    </p>
    <p>
      Many clairsentience powers have cone-shaped areas. These move with you and extend in the direction you look. The
      cone defines the area that you can sweep each round. If you study the same area for multiple rounds, you can often
      gain additional information, as noted in the descriptive text for the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Scrying:</strong> A power of the scrying subdiscipline creates an invisible sensor that sends you
      information. Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This
      includes any powers or effects that target you, but not powers or effects that emanate from you. However, the
      sensor is treated as a separate, independent sensory organ of yours, and thus functions normally even if you have
      been blinded, deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 12 or
      higher can notice the sensor by making a DC 20 Intelligence check. The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an
      active power. Lead sheeting or psionic protection blocks scrying powers, and you sense that the power is so
      blocked.
    </p>
    <h3 id="metacreativity">Metacreativity</h3>
    <p>
      Metacreativity powers create objects, creatures, or some form of matter. Creatures you create usually, but not
      always, obey your commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      A metacreativity power draws raw ectoplasm from the Astral Plane to create an object or creature in the place the
      psionic character designates (subject to the limits noted above). Objects created in this fashion are as solid and
      durable as normal objects, despite their originally diaphanous substance. Psionic creatures created with
      metacreativity powers are considered constructs, not outsiders.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature or object brought into being cannot appear inside another creature or object, nor can it appear
      floating in an empty space. It must arrive in an open location on a surface capable of supporting it. The creature
      or object must appear within the power’s range, but it does not have to remain within the range.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purpose of psionics–magic transparency, metacreativity powers are equivalent to powers of the conjuration
      school (thus, creatures immune to conjuration spells are also immune to metacreativity powers).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Creation:</strong> A power of the creation subdiscipline creates an object or creature in the place the
      manifester designates (subject to the limits noted above). If the power has a duration other than instantaneous,
      psionic energy holds the creation together, and when the power ends, the created creature or object vanishes
      without a trace, except for a thin film of glistening ectoplasm that quickly evaporates. If the power has an
      instantaneous duration, the created object or creature is merely assembled through psionics. It lasts indefinitely
      and does not depend on psionics for its existence.
    </p>
    <h3 id="psychokinesis">Psychokinesis</h3>
    <p>
      Psychokinesis powers manipulate energy or tap the power of the mind to produce a desired end. Many of these powers
      produce spectacular effects above and beyond the power’s standard display (see Display, below), such as moving,
      melting, transforming, or blasting a target. Psychokinesis powers can deal large amounts of damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purpose of psionics–magic transparency, psychokinesis powers are equivalent to powers of the evocation
      school (thus, creatures immune to evocation spells are also immune to psychokinesis powers).
    </p>
    <h3 id="psychometabolism">Psychometabolism</h3>
    <p>Psychometabolism powers change the physical properties of some creature, thing, or condition.</p>
    <p>
      For the purpose of psionics– magic transparency, psychometabolism powers are equivalent to powers of the
      transmutation school (thus, creatures immune to transmutation spells are also immune to psychometabolism powers).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Healing:</strong> Psychometabolism powers of the healing subdiscipline can remove damage from creatures.
      However, psionic healing usually falls short of divine magical healing, in direct comparisons.
    </p>
    <h3 id="psychoportation">Psychoportation</h3>
    <p>Psychoportation powers move the manifester, an object, or another creature through space and time.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of psionics–magic transparency, psychoportation powers do not have an equivalent school.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Teleportation:</strong> A power of the teleportation subdiscipline transports one or more creatures or
      objects a great distance. The most potent of these powers can cross planar boundaries. Usually the transportation
      is one-way (unless otherwise noted) and not dispellable. Teleportation is instantaneous travel through the Astral
      Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation.
    </p>
    <h3 id="telepathy">Telepathy</h3>
    <p>Telepathy powers can spy on and affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior.</p>
    <p>Most telepathy powers are mind-affecting.</p>
    <p>
      For the purpose of psionics–magic transparency, telepathy powers are equivalent to powers of the enchantment
      school (thus, creatures resistant to enchantment spells are equally resistant to telepathy powers).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Charm:</strong> A power of the charm subdiscipline changes the way the subject views you, typically making
      it see you as a good friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Compulsion:</strong> A power of the compulsion subdiscipline forces the subject to act in some manner or
      changes the way her mind works. Some compulsion powers determine the subject’s actions or the effects on the
      subject, some allow you to determine the subject’s actions when you manifest them, and others give you ongoing
      control over the subject.
    </p>
    <h3 id="descriptor">[Descriptor]</h3>
    <p>
      Appearing on the same line as the discipline and subdiscipline (when applicable) is a descriptor that further
      categorizes the power in some way. Some powers have more than one descriptor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The descriptors that apply to powers are acid, cold, death, electricity, evil, fire, force, good,
      language-dependent, light, mind-affecting, and sonic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the power interacts with other
      powers, with spells, with special abilities, with unusual creatures, with alignment, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>A language-dependent power uses intelligible language as a medium.</p>
    <p>A mind-affecting power works only against creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or higher.</p>
    <h3 id="level">Level</h3>
    <p>
      The next line of the power description gives a power’s level, a number between 1 and 9 that defines the power’s
      relative strength. This number is preceded by the name of the class whose members can manifest the power. If a
      power is part of a discipline’s list instead of the psion’s general power list, this will be indicated by the name
      of the discipline’s specialist. The specialists a power can be associated with include Egoist (psychometabolism),
      Kineticist (psychokinesis), Nomad (psychoportation), Seer (clairsentience), Shaper (metacreativity), and Telepath
      (telepathy).
    </p>
    <h3 id="display">Display</h3>
    <p>
      When a power is manifested, a display may accompany the primary effect. This secondary effect may be auditory,
      material, mental, olfactory, or visual. No power’s display is significant enough to create consequences for the
      psionic creatures, allies, or opponents during combat. The secondary effect for a power occurs only if the power’s
      description indicates it. If multiple powers with similar displays are in effect simultaneously, the displays do
      not necessary become more intense. Instead, the overall display remains much the same, though with minute spikes
      in intensity. A Psicraft check (DC 10 + 1 per additional power in use) reveals the exact number of simultaneous
      powers in play.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Dispense with Displays:</em> Despite the fact that almost every power has a display, a psionic character can
      always choose to manifest the power without the flashy accompaniment. To manifest a power without any display (no
      matter how many displays it might have), a manifester must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the
      power). This check is part of the action of manifesting the power. If the check is unsuccessful, the power
      manifests normally with its display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if a manifester manifests a power without a display, he is still subject to attacks of opportunity in
      appropriate circumstances. (Of course, another Concentration check can be made as normal to either manifest
      defensively or maintain the power if attacked.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Auditory:</strong> A bass-pitched hum issues from the manifester’s vicinity or in the vicinity of the
      power’s subject (manifester’s choice), eerily akin to many deep-pitched voices. The sound grows in a second from
      hardly noticeable to as loud as a shout strident enough to be heard within 100 feet. At the manifester’s option,
      the instantaneous sound can be so soft that it can be heard only within 15 feet with a successful DC 10 Listen
      check. Some powers describe unique auditory displays.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Material:</strong> The subject or the area is briefly slicked with a translucent, shimmering substance.
      The glistening substance evaporates after 1 round regardless of the power’s duration. Sophisticated psions
      recognize the material as ectoplasmic seepage from the Astral Plane; this substance is completely inert.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mental:</strong> A subtle chime rings once in the minds of creatures within 15 feet of either the
      manifester or the subject (at the manifester’s option). At the manifester’s option, the chime can ring
      continuously for the power’s duration. Some powers describe unique mental displays.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Olfactory:</strong> An odd but familiar odor brings to mind a brief mental flash of a long-buried memory.
      The scent is difficult to pin down, and no two individuals ever describe it the same way. The odor originates from
      the manifester and spreads to a distance of 20 feet, then fades in less than a second (or lasts for the duration,
      at the manifester’s option).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Visual:</strong> The manifester’s eyes burn like points of silver fire while the power remains in effect.
      A rainbow-flash of light sweeps away from the manifester to a distance of 5 feet and then dissipates, unless a
      unique visual display is described. This is the case when the Display entry includes “see text,” which means that
      a visual effect is described somewhere in the text of the power.
    </p>
    <h3 id="manifesting-time">Manifesting Time</h3>
    <p>
      Most powers have a manifesing time of 1 standard action. Others take 1 round or more, while a few require only a
      free action.
    </p>
    <p>
      A power that takes 1 round to manifest requires a full-round action. It comes into effect just before the
      beginning of your turn in the round after you began manifesting the power. You then act normally after the power
      is completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A power that takes 1 minute to manifest comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute later (and for each of
      those 10 rounds, you are manifesting a power as a full-round action, as noted above for 1-round manifesting
      times). These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the power points are lost and the power fails.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use a power that takes 1 round or longer to manifest, you must continue the concentration from the
      current round to just before your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose concentration before the
      manifesting time is complete, the power points are lost and the power fails.
    </p>
    <p>
      You make all pertinent decisions about a power (range, target, area, effect, version, and so forth) when the power
      comes into effect.
    </p>
    <h3 id="new-action-types">New Action Types</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Swift Action:</strong> A swift action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger
      expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. You can perform one swift action per turn without affecting
      your ability to perform other actions. In that regard, a swift action is like a free action. However, you can
      perform only a single swift action per turn, regardless of what other actions you take. You can take a swift
      action any time you would normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift actions usually involve psionics or the
      activation of psionic items; many characters (especially those who don’t use psionics) never have an opportunity
      to take a swift action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manifesting a quickened power is a swift action. In addition, manifesting any power with a casting time of 1 swift
      action is a swift action.
    </p>
    <p>Manifesting a power with a manifesting time of 1 swift action does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Much like a swift action, an immediate action consumes a very small amount of
      time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. However, unlike a swift action,
      an immediate action can be performed at any time—even if it’s not your turn. Using an immediate action on your
      turn is the same as using a swift action, and counts as your swift action for that turn. You cannot use another
      immediate action or a swift action until after your next turn if you have used an immediate action when it is not
      currently your turn (effectively, using an immediate action before your turn is equivalent to using your swift
      action for the coming turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you are currently flat-footed.
    </p>
    <h3 id="range">Range</h3>
    <p>
      A power’s range indicates how far from you it can reach, as defined in the Range entry of the power description. A
      power’s range is the maximum distance from you that the power’s effect can occur, as well as the maximum distance
      at which you can designate the power’s point of origin. If any portion of the area would extend beyond the range,
      that area is wasted. Standard ranges include the following.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Personal:</strong> The power affects only you.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Touch:</strong> You must touch a creature or object to affect it. A touch power that deals damage can
      score a critical hit just as a weapon can. A touch power threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and
      deals double damage on a successful critical hit. Some touch powersallow you to touch multiple targets. You can
      touch as many willing targets as you can reach, but all targets of the spell must be touched in the same round
      that you manifest the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Close:</strong> The power reaches as far as 25 feet away from you. The maximum range increases 5 feet for
      every two manifester levels you have.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Medium:</strong> The power reaches as far as 100 feet + 10 feet per manifester level.</p>
    <p><strong>Long:</strong> The power reaches as far as 400 feet + 40 feet per manifester level.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Range Expressed in Feet:</strong> Some powers have no standard range category, just a range expressed in
      feet.
    </p>
    <h3 id="aiming-a-power">Aiming a Power</h3>
    <p>
      You must make some choice about whom the power is to affect or where the power’s effect is to originate, depending
      on the type of power. The next entry in a power description defines the power’s target (or targets), its effect,
      or its area, as appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Target or Targets:</strong> Some powershave a target or targets. You manifest these powers on creatures or
      objects, as defined by the power itself. You must be able to see or touch the target, and you must specifically
      choose that target. However, you do not have to select your target until you finish manifesting the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you manifest a targeted power on the wrong type of target the power has no effect. If the target of a power is
      yourself (the power description has a line that reads “Target: You”), you do not receive a saving throw and power
      resistance does not apply. The Saving Throw and Power Resistance lines are omitted from such powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some powers can be manifested only on willing targets. Declaring yourself as a willing target is something that
      can be done at any time (even if you’re flat-footed or it isn’t your turn). Unconscious creatures are
      automatically considered willing, but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who is
      bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically willing. The Saving Throw and
      Power Resistance lines are usually omitted from such powers, since only willing subjects can be targeted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Some powers, such as most metacreativity powers, create things rather than affect things
      that are already present. Unless otherwise noted in the power description, you must designate the location where
      these things are to appear, either by seeing it or defining it. Range determines how far away an effect can
      appear, but if the effect is mobile, it can move regardless of the power’s range once created.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Ray:</em> Some effects are rays. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you make a ranged
      touch attack rather than a normal ranged attack. As with a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an
      invisible creature and hope you hit something. You don’t have to see the creature you’re trying to hit, as you do
      with a targeted power. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of sight or provide cover
      for the creature you’re aiming at.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a ray power has a duration, it’s the duration of the effect that the ray causes, not the length of time the ray
      itself persists.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a ray power deals damage, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a weapon. A ray power threatens a
      critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Spread:</em> Some effectsspread out from a point of origin (which may be a grid intersection, or may be the
      manifester) to a distance described in the power. The effect can extend around corners and into areas that you
      can’t see. Figure distance by actual distance traveled, taking into account turns the effect may take. When
      determining distance for spread effects, count around walls, not through them. As with movement, do not trace
      diagonals across corners. You must designate the point of origin for such an effect (unless the effect is centered
      on you), but you need not have line of effect (see below) to all portions of the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>(S) Shapeable:</em> If an Effect line ends with “(S)” you can shape the power. A shaped effect can have no
      dimension smaller than 10 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Area:</strong> Some powers affect an area. Sometimes a power description specifies a specially defined
      area, but usually an area falls into one of the categories defined below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point where the power originates, but otherwise you usually
      don’t control which creatures or objects the power affects. The point of origin of a power that affects an area is
      always a grid intersection. When determining whether a given creature is within the area of a power, count out the
      distance from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when determining the range
      for a ranged attack. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square to the center
      of the next, you count from intersection to intersection.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can count diagonally across a square, but every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of distance. If the far
      edge of a square is within the power’s area, anything within that square is within the power’s area. If the
      power’s area touches only the near edge of a square, however, anything within that square is unaffected by the
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Burst, Emanation, or Spread:</em> Most powers that affect an area function as a burst, an emanation, or a
      spread. In each case, you select the power’s point of origin and measure its effect from that point. A burst power
      affects whatever it catches in its area, even including creatures that you can’t see. It can’t affect creatures
      with total cover from its point of origin (in other words, its effects don’t extend around corners). The default
      shape for a burst effect is a sphere, but some burst powers are specifically described as cone-shaped.
    </p>
    <p>A burst’s area defines how far from the point of origin the power’s effect extends.</p>
    <p>
      An emanation power functions like a burst power, except that the effect continues to radiate from the point of
      origin for the duration of the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spread power spreads out like a burst but can turn corners. You select the point of origin, and the power
      spreads out a given distance in all directions. Figure the area the power effect fills by taking into account any
      turns the effect takes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Cone, Line, or Sphere:</em> Most powers that affect an area have a particular shape, such as a cone, line, or
      sphere. A cone-shaped power shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts
      from any corner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either bursts or emanations (see above),
      and thus won’t go around corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      A line-shaped power shoots away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of
      your square and extends to the limit of its range or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect. A
      line-shaped power affects all creatures in squares that the line passes through or touches.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sphere-shaped power expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres may be bursts,
      emanations, or spreads.
    </p>
    <p><em>Other:</em> A power can have a unique area, as defined in its description.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Line of Effect:</strong> A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a power can
      affect. A solid barrier cancels a line of effect, but it is not blocked by fog, darkness, and other factors that
      limit normal sight. You must have a clear line of effect to any target that you manifest a power on or to any
      space in which you wish to create an effect. You must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of any
      power you manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A burst, cone, or emanation power affects only an area, creatures, or objects to which it has line of effect from
      its origin (a spherical burst’s center point, a cone-shaped burst’s starting point, or an emanation’s point of
      origin). An otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does not block a power’s line
      of effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length of wall containing the hole is no longer considered a
      barrier for the purpose of determining a power’s line of effect.
    </p>
    <h3 id="duration">Duration</h3>
    <p>A power’s Duration line tells you how long the psionic energy of the power lasts.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Timed Durations:</strong> Many durations are measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or some other increment.
      When the time is up, the psionic energy sustaining the effect fades, and the power ends. If a power’s duration is
      variable it is rolled secretly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Instantaneous:</strong> The psionic energy comes and goes the instant the power is manifested, though the
      consequences might be long-lasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Permanent:</strong> The energy remains as long as the effect does. This means the power is vulnerable to
      <i>dispel psionics</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Concentration:</strong> The power lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain a
      power is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Anything that could break your
      concentration when manifesting a power can also break your concentration while you’re maintaining one, causing the
      power to end. You can’t manifest a power while concentrating on another one. Some powers may last for a short time
      after you cease concentrating. In such a case, the power keeps going for the given length of time after you stop
      concentrating, but no longer. Otherwise, you must concentrate to maintain the power, but you can’t maintain it for
      more than a stated duration in any event. If a target moves out of range, the power reacts as if your
      concentration had been broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Subjects, Effects, and Areas:</strong> If the power affects creatures directly the result travels with the
      subjects for the power’s duration. If the power creates an effect, the effect lasts for the duration. The effect
      might move or remain still. Such an effect can be destroyed prior to when its duration ends. If the power affects
      an area then the power stays with that area for its duration. Creatures become subject to the power when they
      enter the area and are no longer subject to it when they leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Touch Powers and Holding the Charge:</strong> In most cases, if you don’t discharge a touch power on the
      round you manifest it, you can hold the charge (postpone the discharge of the power) indefinitely. You can make
      touch attacks round after round. If you touch anything with your hand while holding a charge, the power
      discharges. If you manifest another power, the touch power dissipates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some touch powersallow you to touch multiple targets as part of the power. You can’t hold the charge of such a
      power; you must touch all the targets of the power in the same round that you finish manifesting the power. You
      can touch one friend (or yourself) as a standard action or as many as six friends as a full round action.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Discharge:</strong> Occasionally a power lasts for a set duration or until triggered or discharged.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>(D) Dismissible:</strong> If the Duration line ends with “(D),” you can dismiss the power at will. You
      must be within range of the power’s effect and must mentally will the dismissal, which causes the same display as
      when you first manifested the power. Dismissing a power is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity. A power that depends on concentration is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does not
      take an action or cause a display, since all you have to do to end the power is to stop concentrating on your
      turn.
    </p>
    <h3 id="saving-throw">Saving Throw</h3>
    <p>
      Usually a harmful power allows a target to make a saving throw to avoid some or all of the effect. The Saving
      Throw line in a power description defines which type of saving throw the power allows and describes how saving
      throws against the power work.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Negates:</strong> The power has no effect on a subject that makes a successful saving throw.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Partial:</strong> The power causes an effect on its subject, such as death. A successful saving throw
      means that some lesser effect occurs (such as being dealt damage rather than being killed).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Half:</strong> The power deals damage, and a successful saving throw halves the damage taken (round down).
    </p>
    <p><strong>None:</strong> No saving throw is allowed.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>(object):</strong> The power can be manifested on objects, which receive saving throws only if they are
      psionic or if they are attended (held, worn, grasped, or the like) by a creature resisting the power, in which
      case the object uses the creature’s saving throw bonus unless its own bonus is greater. (This notation does not
      mean that a power can be manifested only on objects. Some powers of this sort can be manifested on creatures or
      objects.) A psionic item’s saving throw bonuses are each equal to 2 + one-half the item’s manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(harmless):</strong> The power is usually beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a
      saving throw if it desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Saving Throw Difficulty Class:</strong> A saving throw against your power has a DC 10 + the level of the
      power + your key ability modifier (Intelligence for a psion, Wisdom for a psychic warrior, or Charisma for a
      wilder). A power’s level can vary depending on your class. Always use the power level applicable to your class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Succeeding on a Saving Throw:</strong> A creature that successfully saves against a power that has no
      obvious physical effects feels a hostile force or a tingle, but cannot deduce the exact nature of the attack.
      Likewise, if a creature’s saving throw succeeds against a targeted power you sense that the power has failed. You
      do not sense when creatures succeed on saves against effect and area powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Failing a Saving Throw against Mind-Affecting Powers:</strong> If you fail your save, you are unaware that
      you have been affected by a power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Automatic Failures and Successes:</strong> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always a
      failure, and the power may deal damage to exposed items (see Items Surviving after a Saving Throw, below). A
      natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Voluntarily Giving up a Saving Throw:</strong> A creature can voluntarily forego a saving throw and
      willingly accept a power’s result. Even a character with a special resistance to psionics can suppress this
      quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Items Surviving after a Saving Throw:</strong> Unless the descriptive text for the power specifies
      otherwise, all items carried or worn by a creature are assumed to survive a psionic attack. If a creature rolls a
      natural 1 on its saving throw against the effect, however, an exposed item is harmed (if the attack can harm
      objects). Refer to Table: Items Affected by Psionic Attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Determine which four objects carried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected and roll randomly
      among them. The randomly determined item must make a saving throw against the attack form or take whatever damage
      the attack deals.

    <h3 id="power-resistance">Power Resistance</h3>
    <p>
      Power resistance is a special defensive ability. If your power is being resisted by a creature with power
      resistance, you must make a manifester level check (d20 + manifester level) at least equal to the creature’s power
      resistance for the power to affect that creature. The defender’s power resistance functions like an Armor Class
      against psionic attacks. Spell resistance is equivalent to power resistance unless the Psionics Is Different
      option is in use. Include any adjustments to your manifester level on this manifester level check.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Power Resistance line and the descriptive text of a power description tell you whether power resistance
      protects creatures from the power. In many cases, power resistance applies only when a resistant creature is
      targeted by the power, not when a resistant creature encounters a power that is already in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terms “object” and “harmless” mean the same thing for power resistance as they do for saving throws. A
      creature with power resistance must voluntarily lower the resistance (a standard action) to be affected by a power
      noted as harm less. In such a case, you do not need to make the manifester level check described above.
    </p>
    <h3 id="power-points">Power Points</h3>
    <p>All powers have a Power Points line, indicating the power’s cost.</p>
    <p>
      The psionic character class tables show how many power points a character has access to each day, depending on
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      A power’s cost is determined by its level, as shown below. Every power’s cost is noted in its description for ease
      of reference.

    <p>
      <strong>Power Point Limit:</strong> Some powers allow you to spend more than their base cost to achieve an
      improved effect, or augment the power. The maximum number of points you can spend on a power (for any reason) is
      equal to your manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>XP Cost (XP):</strong> On the same line that the power point cost of a power is indicated, the power’s
      experience point cost, if any, is noted. Particularly powerful effects entail an experience point cost to you. No
      spell or power can restore XP lost in this manner. You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a level, so you
      cannot manifest a power with an XP cost unless you have enough XP to spare. However, you can, on gaining enough XP
      to attain a new level, use those XP for manifesting a power rather than keeping them and advancing a level. The XP
      are expended when you manifest the power, whether or not the manifestation succeeds.
    </p>
    <h3 id="descriptive-text">Descriptive Text</h3>
    <p>
      This portion of a power description details what the power does and how it works. If one of the previous lines in
      the description included “see text,” this is where the explanation is found. If the power you’re reading about is
      based on another power you might have to refer to a different power for the “see text” information. If a power is
      the equivalent of a spell an entry of “see spell text” directs you to the appropriate spell description.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> Many powers have variable effects based on the number of power points you spend when you
      manifest them. The more points spent, the more powerful the manifestation. How this extra expenditure affects a
      power is specific to the power. Some augmentations allow you to increase the number of damage dice, while others
      extend a power’s duration or modify a power in unique ways. Each power that can be augmented includes an entry
      giving how many power points it costs to augment and the effects of doing so. However, you can spend only a total
      number of points on a power equal to your manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augmenting a power takes place as part of another action (manifesting a power). Unless otherwise noted in the
      Augment section of an individual power description, you can augment a power only at the time you manifest it.
