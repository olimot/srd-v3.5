    <h1>PSIONIC ITEMS</h1>

    <h2 id="using-items">Using Items</h2>
    <p>
      To use a psionic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation is accomplished simply by picking up an
      item or putting it on. Some items, once they are carried or worn, function constantly. In most cases, using an
      item requires a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. By contrast, power completion items
      (see below) are treated just like powers in combat and do provoke attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Activating a psionic item is a standard action unless the item description indicates otherwise. The manifesting
      time of a power is the time required to activate the same power in an item, whether it’s a power stone, a dorje,
      or a psionic tattoo, unless the item description specifically states otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>The four ways to activate psionic items are described below.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="using-items--power-completion">Power Completion:</strong> This is the activation method for power
      stones. A power stone holds a power that is mostly finished. All that’s left to do is perform the short, simple,
      finishing parts of the manifestation (the final mental coda, as it were). To use a power completion item safely, a
      character must be of high enough level in the appropriate class to manifest the power already. If he can’t already
      manifest the power, there’s a chance he’ll make a mistake (see Brainburn in the power stone description).
      Activating a power completion item is a standard action and provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as manifesting
      a power does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Powers stored in power completion items are usually not augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is
      assumed to be the minimum necessary to manifest the stored power. However, an item’s description may specify
      otherwise (some power stones have manifester levels higher than the minimum required to manifest the stored power,
      and are then assumed to be augmented as well).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="using-items--power-trigger">Power Trigger:</strong> This is the activation method for dorjes and
      psicrowns. It requires the special knowledge of power manifestation that a character of the appropriate class
      would know, and the formation of the appropriate command thought. If a power is on a character’s power list, the
      character knows how to use a power trigger item that stores that power. The user must still determine what power
      is stored in the item before she can activate it. Activating a power trigger item is a standard action that does
      not provoke attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Powers stored in power trigger items are not augmented. Such powers are assumed to be stored in the item at the
      minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. However, certain items may specify a higher manifester
      level than necessary. If such an item holds a power that deals hit point damage, the power is assumed to be
      augmented to the maximum allowed by the power and the manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="using-items--command-thought">Command Thought:</strong> If no activation method is suggested either in
      the psionic item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command thought is needed to activate it.
      Command thought activation means that a character mentally projects a thought, and the item activates. No other
      special knowledge is needed. Activating a command thought psionic item is a standard action that does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the command thought to activate an item is mentally imprinted within it and is whispered into the mind
      of a creature who picks it up. Other items are silent, but a Knowledge (psionics) or Knowledge (history) check
      might be useful in helping to identify command thoughts. A successful DC 30 check is needed to come up with the
      command thought in this case. The power <i>psionic identify</i> reveals command thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Powers stored in command thought items are usually not augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is
      assumed to be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="using-items--use-activated">Use-Activated:</strong> This type of psionic item simply has to be used to
      activate. Use activation is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Some items made for wearing must still be activated.
      Although this activation sometimes requires a command thought (see above), usually it means mentally willing the
      activation to happen (a free action). The description of an item states whether a command thought is needed in
      such a case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated psionic item is either a standard action or not an action at
      all and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an action that provokes
      attacks of opportunity in itself. If the use of the item takes time before a psionic effect occurs, then use
      activation is a standard action. If the item’s activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time, use
      activation is not an action at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use activation doesn’t mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at
      least guess) what the item can do and then use the item to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes
      automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Powers stored in use-activated items are usually not augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is
      assumed to be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.
    </p>
    <h2 id="saving-throws-against-psionic-item-powers">Saving Throws Against Psionic Item Powers</h2>
    <p>
      Psionic items produce psionic powers. The DC of a saving throw against a power from a psionic item is always 10 +
      the level of the power or effect + the ability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to manifest that level
      of power.
    </p>
    <p>Another way to figure the same number is to multiply the power’s level by 1-1/2 and add 10 to the result.</p>
    <p>
      Psicrowns are an exception to the rule. Treat the saving throw as if the wielder manifested the power, including
      caster level and all modifiers to save DC.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some psionic items take advantage of the fact that powers can be augmented to increase their saving throw DCs.
      These items are special and have their cost to create and market price calculated using the manifester’s level
      instead of the power’s level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various effects, particularly when the effect has no exact power
      equivalent (making its level otherwise difficult to quickly determine).
    </p>
    <h2 id="damaging-psionic-items">Damaging Psionic Items</h2>
    <p>
      A psionic item doesn’t need to make a saving throw unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the
      effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his saving throw. Psionic items should always get a save against
      powers or spells that might deal damage to them—even against attacks from which a mundane item would normally get
      no chance to save. All types of psionic item saves—Fortitude, Reflex, and Will—are calculated the same way: The
      item’s saving throw bonus equals 2 + 1/2 its manifester level (round down). The only exceptions to this rule are
      intelligent psionic items, which make Will saves based on their own Wisdom scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      A psionic item, unless otherwise noted, takes damage as a normal item of the same type. A damaged psionic item
      continues to function, but if it is destroyed, all its psionic power is lost.
    </p>
    <h3 id="damaging-psionic-items--repairing-items">Repairing Items</h3>
    <p>
      Some psionic items (especially psionic weapons and shields) may take damage over the course of an adventure. It
      costs no more to repair a psionic item with the Craft skill than it does to repair its nonpsionic counterpart. The
      <i>make whole</i> spell can repair a damaged—but not completely broken— psionic item.
    </p>
    <h2 id="intelligent-items">Intelligent Items</h2>
    <p>
      Some psionic items, particularly weapons, have an intelligence all their own. Only permanent psionic items (as
      opposed to those that are single-use items, those that have charges, or those that store power points) can be
      intelligent. (This means that psionic tattoos, power stones, and dorjes, among other items, are never
      intelligent.) In general, less than 1% of psionic items have intelligence.
    </p>
    <h2 id="cursed-items">Cursed Items</h2>
    <p>
      Some psionic items are cursed—incorrectly made, or corrupted by outside forces. Cursed items might be particularly
      dangerous to the user, or they might be normal items with a minor f law, an inconvenient requirement, or an
      unpredictable nature. Randomly generated items are cursed 5% of the time.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charges-and-multiple-uses">Charges and Multiple Uses</h2>
    <p>
      Some items are limited in power by the number of charges they hold or the number of power points they contain.
      Normally, charged items (such as dorjes) have 50 charges at most. If such an item is found as a random part of a
      treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of charges left (round down, minimum 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, items that contain power points (such as psicrowns) have a number of points equal to 50 x the
      manifester level of the creator. If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2
      to determine the number by which the manifester level is multiplied (round down, minimum 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Market prices given on the tables are always for fully charged or fully powered items. (When an item is created,
      it is fully charged or fully powered.) For an item that’s worthless when its charges or power points run out
      (which is the case for almost all charged or powered items), the value of the partially used item is proportional
      to the number of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to its charges, only part of the item’s
      value is based on the number of charges left.
    </p>
    <p>Some items are single-use and expendable. Such items can often be found in sets or groups.</p>

    <h2 id="psionic-item-descriptions">Psionic Item Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
      In the following sections, each type of psionic item, such as armor or psionic tattoos, has a general description,
      followed by descriptions of specific items.
    </p>
    <p>
      General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other information. The Armor Class,
      hardness, hit points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some types of psionic items. The Armor Class
      assumes that the item is unattended and includes a –5 penalty for the item’s effective Dexterity of 0. If a
      creature holds the item, use the creature’s Dexterity modifier as an adjustment to Armor Class in place of the –5
      penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some individual items, notably those that simply store psionic powers, don’t get full-blown descriptions. Simply
      reference the power’s description. Assume that the power is manifested at the minimum level required to manifest
      it, unless otherwise noted. Increasing the manifester level so increases the cost of the item; see Table:
      Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Value,substituting “spell” for “power” and “caster level” for “manifester level”
      as appropriate. The main reason to make the manifester level higher, or course, would be to increase the potency
      of the power. Raising the manifester level is common for powers such as
      <i>astral construct</i>, the duration of which increases with the level of the manifester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Items with full descriptions have their abilities detailed, and each of the following aspects of these items is
      summarized at the end of the description.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--aura">Aura:</strong> Most of the time, a <i>detect psionics</i> power will
      reveal the discipline associated with a psionic item and the strength of the aura an item emits. This information
      (when applicable) is given at the beginning of the item’s notational entry in the form of a phrase. See the
      <i>detect psionics</i> power description for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--manifester-level">Manifester Level:</strong> The next entry in the summary
      indicates the level of the creator (or the manifester level of the powers placed within the item, if this level is
      lower than the actual level of the creator). The manifester level provides the item’s saving throw bonus, as well
      as range and other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable).
    </p>
    <p>
      It also determines the level that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a
      <i>dispel psionics</i> power or a similar situation. This information is given in the form “ML x,” where “ML” is
      an abbreviation for manifester
    </p>
    <p>level and “x” is an ordinal number representing the manifester level itself.</p>
    <p>
      For psionic tattoos, power stones, and dorjes, the creator can set the manifester level of an item at any number
      high enough to manifest the stored power and not higher than her own manifester level. For other psionic items,
      the item itself determines the manifester level. In this case, the creator’s manifester level must be as high as
      the item’s manifester level (and prerequisites may effectively put a higher minimum on the creator’s level).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--prerequisites">Prerequisites:</strong> Certain requirements must be met in
      order for a character to create a psionic item. These include feats, powers, and miscellaneous requirements such
      as level, alignment, and race or kind. The prerequisites for creation of an item are given in the summary
      immediately following the item’s manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      A power prerequisite can be provided by a character who knows the power, or through the use of a power completion
      or power trigger psionic item or a psi-like ability that produces the desired power effect. For each day that
      passes during the creation process, the creator must expend one power completion item (such as a power stone) or 1
      charge from a power trigger item (such as a dorje), if either of those objects is used to supply a prerequisite.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant
      providing one or more of the prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary, such as if one
      character knows some of the powers necessary to create an item and another character knows the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered the
      creator for the purpose of determinations where the creator’s level must be known. (It’s sensible, although not
      mandatory, for the highest-level character involved to be considered the creator.) The character designated as the
      creator pays the experience points required to make the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, a list of prerequisites includes one feat and one or more powers (or some other requirement in addition
      to the feat). When two powers at the end of a list are separated by “or,” one of those powers is required in
      addition to every other power mentioned prior to the last two.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--market-price">Market Price:</strong> This gold piece value, given in the
      summary following the word “Price,” represents the price someone should expect to pay to buy the item. Market
      prices are also included on the random generation tables for easy reference. The market price of an item that can
      be constructed with a psionic item creation feat is usually equal to the base price + the price for any components
      (special materials or experience point expenditure).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--cost-to-create">Cost to Create:</strong> The cost in gold pieces and
      experience points to create the item is given in the summary following the word “Cost.” This information appears
      only for items with components (material or experience points) that make their market prices higher than their
      base prices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the cost of the components.
      Items without components do not have a “Cost” entry. For them, the market price and base price are the same. The
      cost in gold pieces is 1/2 the market price, and the cost in experience points is 1/25 the market price.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--weight">Weight:</strong> The notational entry for many items ends with a
      value for the item’s weight. When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for the
      purpose of determining how much of a load a character can carry).

    <h3 id="psionic-item-descriptions--armor-and-shields">Armor and Shields</h3>
    <p>
      In general, psionic armor and shields follow the rules for the equivalent magic items, as far as enhancement
      bonuses, stacking, and other base abilities are concerned. An enhancement bonus is treated the same way regardless
      of whether magic or psionics created it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psionic armor and shields differ from standard and magical equivalents in that psionic armor and shields
      incorporate one or more crystals into their construction. Particularly powerful armor and shields may be entirely
      composed of brightly hued or transparent crystals.

      radiate light for a number of rounds equal to the points of damage absorbed. This light is sufficient to
      illuminate a 60-foot-radius area.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the armor absorbs more damage while it is radiating light, the newer radiant effect overlaps (does not stack
      with) the effect that was already in place.

      The wielder of a ranged shield can throw it in combat, with a range increment of 30 feet. While in the air, the
      shield is treated in all ways as a ranged weapon and cannot be blocked or grabbed except by those with appropriate
      feats. No matter the size of the wielder, a buckler or light shield deals 1d6 points of damage and a heavy one 1d8
      points. (A tower shield cannot be created with this special ability.) The wielder’s Strength modifier and the
      shield’s enhancement bonus add to the base damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ranged shield flies through the air back to the creature that threw it. It returns to the wielder just before
      the creature’s next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn).
    </p>
    <p>
      Catching a ranged shield when it comes back is a free action. If the wielder can’t catch it, or if the wielder has
      moved since throwing it, the shield drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.

      This kind of armor grants a wider than normal field of vision, so that opponents flanking the wearer gain only a
      +1 bonus on their attack rolls instead of +2 (rogues still get their full sneak attack damage because the wearer
      is still flanked). The wearer gains a +1 enhancement bonus on Spot checks but takes a –2 penalty on saves against

      As a standard action once per day, the wielder can drop this kind of shield at his feet and command a

      This effect forms a wall whose area is up to twelve 10-foot squares or a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up
      to 12 feet. The wall dissipates after 7 minutes, or sooner if the wielder of the shield reclaims it (thus
      dismissing the effect).

    <p>
      Although they generally follow the rules for magic weapons, psionic weapons differ from mundane and magic weapons
      in their design. Most possess some crystal components, and some are composed entirely of crystal. Many also sport
      intricate traceries along the blade or haft, which flicker now and then as if channeling flows of psychic energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psionic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses on both attack and damage
      rolls when used in combat. This enhancement bonus is effective for the purpose of overcoming creatures with damage
      resistance that is penetrated by magic. All psionic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork
      bonus on attack rolls does not stack with their enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be
      used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonus applies to either type of attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to enhancement bonuses, psionic weapons can also have the special abilities detailed here. A weapon
      with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules for manifester level for weapons (called caster level), additional damage dice, ranged weapons and
      ammunition, ammunition and breakage, hardness and hit points, critical hits, and weapons for unusually sized
      creatures for psionic weapons are the same as for magic weapons. Psionic weapons do not have the chance to
      generate light (though some may be mentally audible; see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--weapons--mentally-audible">Mentally Audible:</strong> Fully 30% of psionic
      weapons telepathically mutter, croon, recite battle poems, scream, or produce other mental “noises” when first
      drawn, at first blood, or when they slay a significant enemy. Such a weapon cannot be concealed from creatures
      within 15 feet when it is drawn, nor can its mental “soundtrack” be curbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--weapons--activation">Activation:</strong> Usually a character benefits from
      a psionic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon—by attacking with it. If a weapon has
      a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to project a command thought (a
      standard action).

      All feeder weapons have a special ability that functions only upon scoring a successful critical hit. A bodyfeeder
      weapon grants its wielder temporary hit points equal to the total damage dealt by a successful critical hit. These
      temporary hit points last for 10 minutes. Thus, if the wielder of a bodyfeeder weapon successfully scores a
      critical hit while the wielder still enjoys temporary hit points from a previous critical hit, the wielder gains
      only the better of the two values: either his current number of temporary hit points, or the new influx of
      temporary hit points, whichever is higher.

      Coup de grace weapons are exceptionally dangerous. On a successful critical hit, the foe must succeed on a DC 27
      Will save or be paralyzed for 1 round. While this ability does work on creatures that are immune to extra damage
      from critical hits, it does not work on creatures without an Intelligence score. Bows, crossbows, and slings

      All feeder weapons have a special ability that functions only upon scoring a successful critical hit. A mindfeeder
      weapon grants its wielder temporary power points equal to the total damage dealt by a successful critical hit.
      These temporary power points last for 10 minutes. The wielder gains power points even if the target has none
      (effectively, its hit point damage is converted to power points). Constructs and undead are not subject to
      mindfeeder weapons. As with temporary hit points, temporary power points do not stack with each other; they
      overlap. Thus, if a mindfeeder weapon successfully scores a critical hit while the wielder still enjoys temporary
      power points from a previous critical hit, the wielder gains only the better of the two values: either her current
      number of temporary power points, or the new influx of temporary power points, whichever is higher.

      A power storing weapon allows a manifester to store a single targeted power of up to 5 power points in the weapon.
      (The power must have a manifesting time of 1 standard action.) Any time the weapon strikes a creature and the
      creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately manifest the power on that creature as a swift action if
      the wielder desires. (This ability is an exception to the rule that manifesting a power from an item takes at
      least as long as manifesting that power normally.) Once the power is manifested, the weapon is empty, and a
      manifester can imbed any other targeted power of up to 5 power points into it. The weapon telepathically whispers
      to the wearer the name of the power currently stored within it. A randomly generated power storing weapon has a
      50% chance to have a power stored in it already.

      never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way while the weapon is wielded. Psibane

      A psychic weapon’s power depends on its wielder. In the hands of a nonpsionic creature, the weapon possesses the
      qualities of a nonmagical, nonpsionic masterwork weapon. When wielded by a psionic creature, this weapon has an
      enhancement bonus based on the wielder’s current power point reserve, as shown on the following table. The
      weapon’s enhancement bonus decreases as the wielder spends power points, and it increases whenever the wielder
      gains enough power points (by any means) to put his power point reserve into the next higher category.

    <h3 id="psionic-item-descriptions--dorjes">Dorjes</h3>
    <p>
      A dorje is a slender crystal that contains a single power. Each dorje has 50 charges when created, and each charge
      expended allows one use of that power. A dorje that runs out of charges is just a simple crystal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--dorjes--physical-description">Physical Description:</strong> A typical
      dorje is an elongated crystal of one color (or colorless), between 8 inches and 10 inches long and about 1/2 inch
      thick, which can weigh up to 1/4 pound. Occasionally, a dorje is decorated with carvings or inscribed runes along
      a face of the crystal. A typical dorje has AC 7, 7 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 18.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--dorjes--activation">Activation:</strong> Dorjes use the power trigger
      activation method, so manifesting a power from a dorje is usually a standard action that does not provoke attacks
      of opportunity. (If the power being manifested has a manifesting time longer than 1 standard action, however, it
      takes that long to manifest the power from a dorje.) The user must have the power on his class list, even if he
      knows the command thought. Additionally, to activate a dorje, a character must hold it in hand and point it in the
      general direction of the target or area to be affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorjes are normally created at the minimum manifester level required to manifest the power, and powers that can be
      augmented are not augmented when stored in a dorje. A dorje’s wielder cannot augment the power contained within
      the dorje. However, dorjes can be created at a higher manifester level than required to manifest the power. In
      this case, the dorje that holds an augmentable power is augmented, to the limit of the manifester level and the
      power’s augmentation maximums, if any. The manifester level of a dorje cannot be more than five higher than the
      minimum manifester level to use the power it contains.

    <h3 id="psionic-item-descriptions--power-stones">Power Stones</h3>
    <p>
      A power stone stores a power (or collection of powers). A stored power can be used only once, “flushing” the
      stone. Using a power stone is basically like manifesting a power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--power-stones--physical-description">Physical Description:</strong> A power
      stone is a thumb-sized chunk of crystal that possesses a barely detectable interior glow if it holds a low-level
      power. A stone imprinted with more than one power or a higher-level power glows more brightly, but never enough to
      provide illumination in its own right. A typical power stone has AC 7, 5 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break
      DC of 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--power-stones--activation">Activation:</strong> To activate a power stone, a
      manifester must mentally address it, as described below. Once the power is known, the power stone is treated as a
      power completion item, except as noted below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="psionic-item-descriptions--power-stones--activation--addressing-the-stone">Addressing the Stone:</em> A
      power stone must be “addressed” before a character can use it or know exactly what power it contains. Doing this
      requires a successful Psicraft check (DC 15 + power level). Once a particular power stone has been addressed, it
      is not necessary to do so again. Addressing a power stone in advance lets a character proceed directly to the next
      step when the time comes to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a stone’s stored power after addressing the stone requires holding the stone and willing the power’s
      manifestation, as if manifesting a power normally (a standard action). Activating a power stone is subject to
      disruption just as manifesting a power normally would be.
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, the user must meet the following requirements.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The user must have the power on his or her class list.</li>
      <li>The user must have the requisite key ability score.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If the user meets these requirements and has a manifester level at least equal to the power’s manifester level,
      she can automatically manifest the stored power without a check. If she meets both requirements but her own level
      is lower than the power stone’s manifester level, she has to make a manifester level check (1d20 + user’s level),
      against a DC equal to the power stone’s manifester level +1, to manifest the power successfully. On a failure, the
      user must succeed on a DC 5 Wisdom check to avoid brainburn (see below). A natural roll of 1 on this check is
      always a failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="psionic-item-descriptions--power-stones--activation--determine-effect">Determine Effect:</em> A power
      successfully manifested from a power stone works exactly as if manifested normally. Assume the power stone’s
      manifester level is always the minimum level required to manifest the power for the character who imprinted the
      stone, unless the creator specifically desires otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>A power stone’s glow fades when its stored power is flushed.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="psionic-item-descriptions--power-stones--activation--brainburn">Brainburn:</em> When something goes awry,
      the user of a power stone improperly manifests the stored power. The resultant psionic surge persists for 1d4
      rounds, unless the power stone is flung farther than 100 feet away or is destroyed. This surge deals 1d6 points of
      damage per power stored per round and arcs across multiple targets, similar to <i>energy current</i>, except the
      damage type isn’t specified. The user is the primary target, and one nearby ally is the secondary target (chosen
      at random).
    </p>
    <p>
      The manifester level for a standard power stone is the minimum manifester level needed to manifest the power
      (unless otherwise specified).

    <p>
      A psicrown is a special headband that stores several powers. Unlike dorjes, which can contain a wide variety of
      powers, each psicrown is of a certain kind and holds specific powers. Unless otherwise stated, a psicrown has
      power points equal to 50 x its manifester level when created. These power points can be spent only on the powers
      that are contained in the psicrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--psicrowns--physical-description">Physical Description:</strong> A typical
      psicrown is large enough to fit on the head of a Medium creature. Some psicrowns are actually crownlike and
      heavily adorned, while others are simple headbands with crystal centerpieces. All psicrowns weigh less than 1
      pound. Most psicrowns are metallic, but one could potentially be composed of any material. Metallic psicrowns have
      AC 10, 10 hit points, hardness 8, and a break DC of 28. Psicrowns made of psionically reinforced silk have AC 7,
      10 hit points, hardness 2, and a break DC of 24. Psicrowns can be made from other, more exotic materials, but all
      have at least the strength and durability of psicrowns made of psionically reinforced silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--psicrowns--activation">Activation:</strong> Psicrowns use the power trigger
      activation method, so manifesting a power from a psicrown is usually a standard action that does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity. (If the power being manifested, however, has a longer manifesting time than 1 standard
      action, it takes that long to manifest the power from a psicrown.) When activating a psicrown, the user spends
      power points contained in the psicrown on any one of the psicrown’s powers. Powers activated from a psicrown can
      be augmented with additional power points from the psicrown itself, so long as the total number of power points
      spent does not exceed the user’s manifester level. The user can’t manifest a power from a psicrown using his own
      power points.

    <h3 id="psionic-item-descriptions--psionic-tattoos">Psionic Tattoos</h3>
    <p>
      Psionic tattoos are designs scribed on the skin that manifest powers on their wearers. The wearer doesn’t get to
      make any decisions about the tattoo’s effect—the manifester who scribed it has already done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psionic tattoos can vary in size, but a creature can wear only a total of twenty tattoos at one time—attempting to
      add one more than this maximum causes all previously scribed tattoos to simultaneously activate. A psionic tattoo
      fades away after use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--psionic-tattoos--physical-description">Physical Description:</strong> A
      typical psionic tattoo is a colorful pattern of tiny, interlacing lines within a larger design. This design can be
      as simple as a circle or a star, or as complex as an artist wishes to make it. Once it is scribed, a tattoo’s
      design does not change. A psionic tattoo usually covers an area of skin no more than 5 inches in diameter (larger
      ones could be designed, but would have no added effect).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--psionic-tattoos--scribing-and-transferring-tattoos"
        >Scribing and Transferring Tattoos:</strong
      >
      The manifester level of a psionic tattoo is the minimum level required to manifest the scribed power. A psionic
      tattoo can contain only powers of 3rd level or lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      A psionic tattoo inscribed on a wearer is potentially more mobile than a mundane tattoo. As a standard action, the
      wearer can will the tattoo to move to a different part of his body or onto the skin of any willing (or
      unconscious) living creature he touches. If the wearer of a psionic tattoo is rendered unconscious or is slain,
      another sentient creature can touch the tattoo while willing it to leave the previous wearer and apply itself to
      the new creature as a standard action. Psionic tattoos cannot overlay one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--psionic-tattoos--identifying-psionic-tattoos"
        >Identifying Psionic Tattoos:</strong
      >
      In addition to the standard methods of identification, the wearer of a tattoo can concentrate on it and attempt to
      gain some sense of how it would feel if activated. A successful DC 13 Intelligence check provides a hint to the
      tattoo’s effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--psionic-tattoos--activation">Activation:</strong> A psionic tattoo produces
      its effect when touched by its wearer and willed to do so. This activity, called “tapping” the tattoo, is a
      standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A psionic tattoo fades away after use.
    </p>
    <p>The following rules govern the use of psionic tattoos.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A creature must have an appropriate physical surface on which to scribe the pattern (thus, incorporeal creatures
        or creatures with impermanent flesh, such as fire elementals, cannot use psionic tattoos).
      </li>
      <li>
        Tapping a psionic tattoo provokes attacks of opportunity. A successful attack (including grappling attacks)
        against the wearer forces a Concentration check. A wearer who fails this check cannot concentrate effectively on
        the tattoo to use it. The tattoo remains untapped, and the wearer can make another attempt.
      </li>
      <li>
        A character can trigger the effects of another’s psionic tattoo if the other wearer is unconscious. It is a
        full-round action to find, touch, and concentrate on an unconscious creature’s tattoo in order to tap it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The manifester level for a standard psionic tattoo is the minimum manifester level needed to manifest the power
      (unless otherwise specified).

      This copper amulet aids the wearer against other psionic characters. Once per day, the wearer can mentally command
      the <i>catapsi</i> power, which blankets a 30- foot-radius area surrounding the wearer in telepathic noise for 9
      rounds. Each time other psionic characters within this range attempt to manifest a power, they must succeed on a
      DC 17 Will save or pay 4 more points than they otherwise would for each power manifestation. The limit on the
      number of power points a subject can spend on a power remains in effect, so the subject may not be able to
      manifest his or her highest-level powers.

      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--universal-items--universal-item-descriptions--crawling-tattoos"
        >Crawling Tattoos:</strong
      >
      Crawling tattoos resemble standard psionic tattoos, but their effects are often harmful rather than beneficial.
      Like a psionic tattoo, a crawling tattoo can be scribed only with a power of no higher than 3rd level that targets
      one or more creatures. Exceptions are the <i>body adjustment</i> power, which can be scribed even though it
      affects only the manifester, and telepathy (compulsion) powers, which cannot be scribed at all. Powers that
      normally have an area affect only one target if scribed in a crawling tattoo. Powers with an experience point
      requirement cannot be scribed into a crawling tattoo. Otherwise, crawling tattoos are treated as psionic tattoos
      until they are activated by the wearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wearer of a crawling tattoo can tap the tattoo as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity,
      mentally specifying a target (to which the wearer must have line of sight). Instead of manifesting its stored
      power, the tattoo animates, drops to the ground, and scuttles toward the target. The original wearer need no
      longer concentrate on the tattoo once animated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animated tattoo moves toward its designated target in the same round when it is activated. Treat it as a Fine
      construct that has AC 18, 10 hit points, a hardness of 5, speed 30 feet, and a bonus on attack rolls equal to the
      wearer’s manifester level + his key ability modifier. Crawling tattoos, unlike true constructs, are subject to
      illusions, darkness, fog, and similar effects. Should the target be killed, teleport away, or otherwise absent
      itself before the animated tattoo reaches it, the wearer can reclaim the tattoo. If it is destroyed, a crawling
      tattoo shatters and evaporates.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crawling tattoo must enter the target’s square to attack and thus provokes attacks of opportunity as it passes
      through the target’s threatened area. The tattoo makes one touch attack per round thereafter until it strikes its
      target or is destroyed. On a successful attack, the power scribed in the crawling tattoo affects the target if the
      target fails the appropriate saving throw; however, powers that normally allow a Reflex saving throw automatically
      affect the touched target. Crawling tattoos can ferry beneficial powers as well as harmful ones, and a target can
      allow the tattoo’s touch attack to succeed if he or she desires.
    </p>
    <p>Two examples of crawling tattoos are described below; many more types are possible.</p>

      <em id="psionic-item-descriptions--universal-items--universal-item-descriptions--crawling-tattoos--market-price"
        >Market Price:</em
      >
      The cost of a crawling tattoo depends on the level of the power scribed in it.

      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--universal-items--universal-item-descriptions--crystal-anchor"
        >Crystal Anchor:</strong
      >
      A <i>crystal anchor</i> is a shaft of transparent crystal 4 to 5 feet in length, with a sharpened, spearlike head
      on one end. It ensnares the minds of those within range who manifest powers of a specified psionic discipline. The
      triggering discipline is specified at the time of creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>crystal anchor</i> is activated by plunging the sharp head into the ground, leaving the shaft freestanding.
      It projects an invisible, 30-foot-radius field. If a power from the speci- fied discipline is manifested within
      this range, the manifester must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + power level) or become subject to an effect
      similar to <i>brain lock</i>, except that the effect is permanent until dispelled or dismissed by the individual
      who initially drove the <i>crystal anchor</i> into the earth. Any anchor can be pulled out of the ground and
      reused at a later time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a <i>crystal anchor</i> successfully ensnares a target, a slender filament of insubstantial ectoplasm
      connects the victim to the shaft, even one outside the original area of the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>crystal anchor</i> can attempt to ensnare a victim only five times per day. Previously caught targets can
      remain caught day after day and do not count against this daily limit on attempts.
    </p>
    <p>
      An anchor’s owner can designate certain creatures to be unaffected by the anchor; such creatures need not make a
      saving throw and do not count against the daily limit on attempts. One <i>crystal anchor</i> can ensnare multiple
      targets simultaneously, and multiple <i>crystal anchors</i> can share overlapping fields.
    </p>
    <p>Anchors that activate when a specific power is manifested in range are also possible, but are rarer.</p>
    <p>A <i>crystal anchor</i> has AC 7, 15 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 20.</p>

      These crystal lenses fit over the user’s eyes. Once per day, the wearer is able to drain power points from another
      psionic creature or character by meeting its gaze as if using <i>power leech</i>. A selected target within 40 feet
      must succeed on a DC 16 Will save, or a connection of crackling energy is formed between the wearer and the
      victim. The connection drains 1d6 power points from the target for every round in which the wearer maintains
      concentration (to a maximum of 7 rounds). The wearer gains 1 power point from those drained from the target each
      round (subject to his normal maximum; points he cannot gain immediately are lost).

      >
      Psychoactive skins (also sometimes called ectoshells) are fistsized globs of psionically charged ectoplasm. As a
      standard action, a psychoactive skin spreads over and covers a Medium or smaller creature that projects the proper
      command thought; the same command thought causes the skin to shrink back down to its former size. Each of the
      various psychoactive skins is charged with one of a wide array of powers that constantly affect the wearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deployed skin completely covers the wearer and all his equipment like a second skin, allowing the wearer to see,
      hear, and breathe normally. It rolls away from various parts of the body as needed, such as when the wearer needs
      to eat or access a backpack. Held items or items specifically excluded are not covered by a psychoactive skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to three skins can be worn simultaneously, although only the outermost is active in any given round (the powers
      of hidden skins cannot be manifested). Skin layers can be changed with a command thought as a standard action,
      which causes a lower-layer skin to come to the surface.

      fire. If the attack hits, the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage as the ectoburst flames up and is consumed.

      These universal items are tiny fragments of cast-off crystal imprinted with minuscule bits of psionic power. Using
      a <i>shard</i> requires grasping it and projecting a command thought as a standard action (most

      <i>shard</i> grants a temporary competence bonus on one specific skill, ranging from +1 to +10. The granted bonus
      lasts until the skill is used or 10 rounds pass, whichever comes first. Once its effect is activated, a

      power points and experience points sufficient to place him halfway into the next level of experience. Those who
      use their powers for evil are punished for their impertinence, losing 5d6 x 1,000 XP for defiling the book. In

    <h4 id="psionic-item-descriptions--psionic-artifacts--major-artifacts">Major Artifacts</h4>
    <p>
      Major artifacts are unique items—only one of each such item exists. They are difficult to find and dangerous to
      handle, but once found, are often even more difficult to destroy. A major psionic artifact has only a single,
      specific means of destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-descriptions--psionic-artifacts--major-artifacts--annulus">Annulus:</strong> This
      artifact is the ultimate psionic nullifier. Forged to keep enemies of vast psionic power at bay, the
      <i>Annulus</i> is an artifact that any psionic being should fear. It has been forgotten in the modern age, and
      merely finding it would precipitate a great upheaval across the planes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Annulus</i> is a 1-foot-diameter ring of silvery material. Tiny slots, antennae, spheres, and other
      intricate projections decorate the exterior of the hoop; however, two smoothed lengths of the ring provide an
      adequate surface for grasping the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Annulus</i> has several powers, all of which require a wielder to tightly grasp the ring with at least one
      hand. When it is first grasped, knowledge of the artifact’s powers immediately flood the wielder’s mind. The
      wielder can access all powers of the <i>Annulus</i> at manifester level 20th.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <i>Annulus</i> generates a continuous <i>catapsi</i> effect within a 100-foot-radius of the wielder (who is
        unaffected).
      </li>
      <li>The wielder gains a +4 enhancement bonus on any attempt to resist an effect that deals ability damage.</li>
      <li>Once per day, the wielder can trigger <i>ultrablast</i> as a standard action.</li>
      <li>
        Three times per day, as a standard action, the wielder can trigger an effect similar to
        <i>psionic dimensional anchor</i> that affects all creatures in a 50-foot radius.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The primary power of the <i>Annulus,</i> however, is psionic nullification. Once per year, the wielder can trigger
      this effect as a special action requiring 10 rounds of continuous concentration to complete. The wielder specifies
      a target or targets within a 100-foot radius, ranging from a specific psionic individual or item to a group of
      psionic beings that share the same philosophy. The nullification effect is accompanied by blasts of light, heat,
      and sound from the <i>Annulus.</i> Nonpsionic creatures and items are unaffected, as are nontargeted beings, but
      any psionic target—regardless of any protection it may possess—disintegrates in a terrific explosion. Nothing is
      left but floating dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is relatively easy to nullify a single target or a small group of targets, but nullifying a more powerful being
      (such as a demigod or greater entity) or another major artifact taxes the <i>Annulus</i> to its limits. If it is
      used to nullify such a target, the artifact succeeds but is destroyed in the process and cannot be retrieved by
      any means.

      The wearer of the <i>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind</i> also gains power resistance equal to 10 + his manifester

    <p>
      The <i>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind</i> has 1,000 power points when discovered. Anyone who dons the crown
      instantly knows the number of power points it has at the current time. The crown recharges itself, gaining back 1
      power point per day if it currently has fewer than 1,000 points.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a special one-time use of the psicrown, the wearer can channel all the remaining charges in the psicrown into
      an uncontrolled burst of energy. The wearer triggers this use as a standard action. All within 20 feet of the
      wearer take hit points of damage equal to half the power points left in the staff (Reflex DC 18 half). The wearer
      inhabits a tiny eye of calm at the center of the destruction and is unharmed, but the psicrown is reduced to a

    <h3 id="creating-psionic-items--creating-dorjes">Creating Dorjes</h3>
    <p>
      To create a dorje, a character needs a small supply of materials, the most obvious being a chunk of crystal or the
      crystal shards of the dorje to be carved from or assembled. The cost of the materials is subsumed in the cost of
      creating the dorje—375 gp x the level of the power x the level of the manifester. Dorjes are always fully charged
      (50 charges) when created.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an augmentable power is incorporated into a dorje at a higher manifester level than the minimum level required
      to manifest the power, each discharge of the power from the dorje is augmented to the limit of that higher
      manifester level. Alternatively, if you want to have a higher manifester level in the dorje, you must pay for the
      dorje as if the power was one level higher for each additional two manifester levels you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in the dorje (or must have the power available in some
      other form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s experience point total, she pays the cost
      (multiplied by 50) upon beginning the dorje in addition to the experience point cost for making the dorje itself.
      The act of working on the dorje costs a number of power points per day equal to the power point cost of the power
      that is being embedded in the crystal of the dorje.
    </p>
    <p>Crafting a dorje requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.</p>

    <h3 id="creating-psionic-items--creating-power-stones">Creating Power Stones</h3>
    <p>
      To create a power stone, a character needs a supply of incense and fine etching tools, the cost of which is
      subsumed in the cost of encoding the power stone—12.5 gp x the level of the power x the level of the manifester.
      All materials used to imprint a power stone must be fresh and unused. A character must pay the full cost for
      encoding each power stone no matter how many times she previously has imprinted the same power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in the power stone (or must have the power available in
      some other form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s experience point total, she pays the cost
      upon beginning the power stone in addition to the experience point cost for making the power stone itself. The act
      of encoding triggers the power as if it had been manifested, costing the character an appropriate number of power
      points.

    <h3 id="creating-psionic-items--creating-psicrowns">Creating Psicrowns</h3>
    <p>
      To create a psicrown, a character needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a circlet, crown, or the
      pieces of the crown to be assembled. The cost of the materials is subsumed in the cost of creating the
      psicrown—375 gp x the level of the highest-level power x the level of the manifester, + 75% of the value of the
      next highest-level power (281.25 gp x the level of the power x the level of the manifester), + one-half of the
      value of any other powers (187.5 gp x the level of the power x the level of the manifester). Psicrowns are always
      created with full power points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, if you want to have a higher manifester level in the psicrown, you must pay for the psicrown as if
      the highest-level power is one level higher for each additional two manifester levels you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creator must know the power or powers to be imprinted in the psicrown (or must have the power available in
      some other form). If any of the powers has an XP cost, the creator must provide XP equal to 50 x that cost. This
      expense is in addition to the experience point cost for making the psicrown itself. The act of working on a
      psicrown costs a number of power points per day equal to the cost of manifesting each of the powers associated
      with the psicrown once per day.
    </p>
    <p>Crafting a psicrown requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.</p>

    <h3 id="creating-psionic-items--creating-psionic-tattoos">Creating Psionic Tattoos</h3>
    <p>
      The creator of a psionic tattoo must have a patch of uncovered skin free of hair and fur, and at least a few
      containers in which to mix dyes. In addition, he needs special materials, usually to create dyes. The costs for
      materials and dyes are subsumed in the cost for scribing the psionic tattoo— 25 gp x the level of the power x the
      level of the manifester. All ingredients and materials used to scribe a psionic tattoo must be fresh and unused.
      The character must pay the full cost for scribing each psionic tattoo. (Economies of scale do not apply.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The user of the psionic tattoo is both the manifester and the target; therefore, powers that target another
      creaturecannot be stored in psionic tattoo form. Powers with a range of personal can be made into psionic tattoos,
      but they cost double the price of standard psionic tattoos.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creator must know the power to be placed in the psionic tattoo (or must have the power available in some other
      form). If manifesting the power would reduce the manifester’s XP total, he pays the XP cost upon beginning the
      scribing in addition to the experience point cost for making the psionic tattoo itself. The act of scribing
      triggers the power as if it had been manifested, costing the character an appropriate number of power points.
    </p>
    <p>Scribing a psionic tattoo requires one day.</p>

    <h3 id="creating-psionic-items--creating-universal-items">Creating Universal Items</h3>
    <p>
      To create a universal item, a character usually needs some sort of equipment or tools to work on the item. He also
      needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being the item itself or the pieces of the item to be assembled. The
      cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the item. Universal item costs are difficult to
      formularize. Refer to Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Valuesand use the given item prices as a guideline.
      Creating an item costs half the market value listed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If powers are involved in the prerequisites for making the item, the creator must know the power to be placed in
      the item (or must have the power available in some other form). Any experience point cost for a prerequisite power
      is not incurred by the creator of the item. The act of working on the item requires a payment of power points
      appropriate to the power or powers associated with the item during each day of the item’s creation.
    </p>
    <p>Crafting a universal item requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.</p>

    <h2 id="special-materials">Special Materials</h2>
    <p>In addition to psionic items with imbedded powers, some substances have innate special properties.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-materials--crystal-deep">Crystal, Deep:</strong> Deep crystal is crystal of above-average
      quality found at the hearts of large veins or deposits of mundane crystal (see below). Deep crystal is renowned
      for its strength and its psionically resonant nature. Mundane crystal is used for many items of psionic
      manufacture, such as dorjes, power stones, and psicrystals. Deep crystal is a better grade.
    </p>
    <p>
      While a weapon made of deep crystal is no different from a mundane crystal weapon for a nonpsionic character, a
      psionic wielder of a deep crystal weapon can focus psionic power through it, increasing the damage that weapon
      deals. As a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, the wielder can channel psionic power into a
      melee weapon or ranged weapon made of deep crystal. For 2 power points, the deep crystal weapon deals an extra 2d6
      points of damage. The weapon will stay charged for 1 minute or until it scores its next hit. Bows, crossbows, and
      slings bestow this power on their ammunition. All missile weapons lose this effect if they miss. However, they may
      be recovered and charged again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any weapon made of deep crystal costs 1,000 gp more than its noncrystal counterpart. Any item could potentially be
      made out of deep crystal. Because deep crystal armor is considered to be made out of metal, druids cannot wear it.
    </p>
    <p>Deep crystal has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and a hardness of 10.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-materials--crystal-mundane">Crystal, Mundane:</strong> Mundane crystal can be used in place of
      metal in weapons or armor, using a special forging process. The fortified crystal possesses the properties of a
      similar masterwork steel weapon or armor, except for visual appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weapons and armor made of mundane crystal cost the same amount to make as their masterwork counterparts. Any item
      could potentially be made with mundane crystal. Because mundane crystal armor is considered to be made out of
      metal, druids cannot wear it.
    </p>
    <p>Mundane crystal properly forged has 25 hit points per inch of thickness and a hardness of 8.</p>
