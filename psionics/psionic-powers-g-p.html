    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Metacreativity (Creation)</li>
      <li><strong>Level:</strong> Shaper 9</li>
      <li><strong>Display:</strong> Material</li>
      <li><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> One week (8 hours/day)</li>
      <li><strong>Range:</strong> 180 ft.; see text</li>
      <li><strong>Effect:</strong> A demiplane coterminous with the Astral Plane, centered on your location</li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</li>
      <li><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None</li>
      <li><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> No</li>
      <li><strong>Power Points:</strong> 17, XP</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You create a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane. Demiplanes created by this power are very small, very
      minor planes. This power works best when manifested while you are on the Astral Plane. Manifestation of this power
      creates a local density fluctuation that precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the fledgling plane
      grows in radius at a rate of 1 foot per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance
      from the surrounding astral ectoplasm. Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum size, it doesn’t really stop
      growing, but its growth rate decreases to only 1 foot per week (approximately a 50-foot increase in radius per
      year). Once your demiplane is created, you can travel to it using <i>astral caravan</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, or
      some other power or permanent link that you arrange for separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      You determine the environment within the demiplane when you manifest
      <i>genesis,</i> reflecting most any desire you can visualize. You determine factors such as atmosphere, water,
      temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This power cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can
      it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth). You must add these details in
      some other fashion if you desire. You can’t create lingering psionic effects with this power; you have to add
      those separately, if desired. Similarly, you can’t create a demiplane out of esoteric material, such as silver or
      uranium; you’re limited to stone and dirt. You can’t manipulate the time trait on your demiplane; its time trait
      is as the Material Plane. Once your demiplane reaches 180 feet in radius, you can manifest this power again to
      gradually add another 180 feet of radius to it, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antigenesis: If <i>genesis</i> is manifested on the Material Plane, the power takes effect and the demiplane
      begins to grow at the rate noted above, but it gets no larger than a radius of 1 foot per level. The energies of
      the new plane are exactly canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a dead spot like a limited
      cancer on the original plane. The expanding boundary of the dead spot wipes away all construction, crumbles
      natural land forms, and evaporates water, leaving behind a uniformly level area of inert dust. Living creatures
      that pass the boundary of the growing dead spot are not directly affected, but plants can find no sustenance in
      the dust of the dead spot, water-breathing creatures die quickly when water turns to dust, and mobile animals know
      enough to leave the area alone. Once the wave of change passes, no special essence remains in the dead spot, and
      it may be colonized naturally over the course of several years by bacteria, plants, and animals.

    <h2 id="graft-weapon">Graft Weapon</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Psychometabolism</li>
      <li><strong>Level:</strong> Psychic warrior 3</li>
      <li><strong>Display:</strong> Olfactory</li>
      <li><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</li>
      <li><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</li>
      <li><strong>Target:</strong> You</li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours (D)</li>
      <li><strong>Power Points:</strong> 5</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You attach any melee weapon you can use in one hand—mundane, psionic, or magical—onto the end of one of your arms.
      The weapon becomes a natural extension of your arm, and that hand blends seamlessly into the shaft, hilt, or head
      of the weapon. Now that the weapon and you are one, you gain a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls
      while using the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grafted weapon is considered both a standard weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of effects that
      distinguish between either weapon type. For instance, the grafted weapon is treated as a natural weapon for the
      purpose of delivering a touch attack with a power in conjunction with the weapon attack. As with any power (or
      spell) melee touch attack made in conjunction with a natural weapon attack, the touch attack effect is not
      delivered unless the natural weapon strikes normally; on a failed attack, the touch power (or spell) is wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a psychic warrior under the effect of the
      <i>claws of the beast</i> power, grafting a weapon means that attacks with this hand deal the base damage of the
      weapon, instead of the claw upon which a psychic warrior normally relies.
    </p>
    <p>
      While your hand is grafted to a weapon, you lose the use of that hand and take a –2 penalty on all skill checks
      requiring the use of hands. Powers that temporarily polymorph or metamorph you can ignore the grafted weapon or
      alter it normally, at your discretion. If the weapon takes damage, you take damage as well. If you are healed, so
      is your grafted weapon. If your weapon is destroyed, you permanently lose 2 points of Constitution; the ability
      drain persists until you can restore your natural anatomy (by means of <i>regenerate</i> or a similar effect).
    </p>
    <p>When this power’s duration expires, the grafted weapon falls to the ground and your hand returns.</p>

    <p>
      You can improve your chances in a grapple as an immediate action, gaining a +4 enhancement bonus on your grapple
      checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power in the
      current round. Manifesting this power is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts
      toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. You can manifest this power when it isn’t your turn (if
      you are grappled).
    </p>

      <strong>Augment:</strong> For every 4 additional power points you spend, the enhancement bonus on your grapple

    <p>
      A tiny ectoplasmic crystal emanates from your outstretched hand and rapidly expands to a 2-foot-diameter ball of
      crystal as it speeds toward the location you designate. You can choose to aim this crystal at a single target or
      at a specific point in space (a grid intersection).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you aim the crystal at a single target, you must make a ranged touch attack to strike the target. Any creature
      or object struck by the ball of crystal takes 5d4 points of bludgeoning damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the crystal hits its target, misses, or was aimed at a point in space, it explodes upon arrival at the
      location you designated. Anyone within 20 feet of the explosion takes 9d4 points of slashing damage from the
      thousands of crystal shards that spray forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s damage from the explosion of
      the crystal increases by 1d4 points.

    <p>
      This power charges your touch with the force of a sledgehammer. A successful melee touch attack deals 1d8 points
      of bludgeoning damage. This damage is not increased or decreased by your Strength modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s duration increases by 1 round.

    <p>
      You gain an additional move action in the current round. Taking a full round’s worth of attacks and then using
      this power to move away from your foe does provoke attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power before you
      move. Manifesting the power is a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal

    <p>
      You make lightning-fast deductions based on only the slightest clue, pattern, or scrap of memory resident in your
      mind. You can make reasonable statements about a person, place, or object, seemingly from very little knowledge.
      However, your knowledge is in fact the result of a rigorously logical process that you force your mind to
      undertake, digging up and correlating every possible piece of knowledge bearing on the topic (possibly even
      extracting echoes of knowledge from the Astral Plane).
    </p>
    <p>
      The nature of the knowledge you gain concerning the subject of your analysis might include the answer to a riddle,
      the way out of a maze, stray bits of information about a person, legends about a place or an object, or even a
      conclusion concerning a dilemma that your conscious mind is unable to arrive at.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Intelligence check may be required to obtain the desired information. If so, you can manifest
      <i>hypercognition</i> as an immediate action prior to making the check and receive a +20 bonus for doing so.

      You are almost impossible to move. Your weight does not vary; instead, you mentally attach yourself to the
      underlying fabric of the plane. Thus, you could conceivably anchor yourself in midair. Any creature attempting to
      physically move you must succeed on an opposed Strength check, and you gain a +20 bonus on the check. You can’t
      voluntarily move to a new location unless you stop concentrating, which ends the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot apply your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class; however, your anchored body gains damage reduction 15/–.

      You cannot make physical attacks or perform any other large-scale movements (you can make smallscale movements,
      such as breathing, turning your head, moving your eyes, talking, and so on). Powers with the teleportation
      descriptor, or any telekinetic effect, manifested on you automatically fail.

      Your mind generates a tangible field of force that provides a +4 armor bonus to Armor Class. Unlike mundane armor,
      <i>inertial armor</i> entails no armor check penalty or speed reduction. Because <i>inertial armor</i> is composed
      of psychokinetic force, incorporeal creatures can’t bypass it the way they do normal armor.

    <p>Your <i>inertial armor</i> can be invisible or can appear as a colored glow, at your option.</p>

      The armor bonus provided by <i>inertial armor</i> does not stack with the armor bonus provided by regular armor.

      psi-like abilities taken by subjects inside the area of the <i>intellect fortress,</i> including ability damage,
      is halved. This lowering takes place prior to the effects of other powers or abilities that lessen damage, such as

      You generally know where you are. This power is useful to characters who end up at unfamiliar destinations after
      teleporting, using a
      <i>gate,</i> or traveling to or from other planes of existence. The power reveals general information about your
      location as a feeling or presentiment. The information is usually no more detailed than a summary that locates you
      according to a prominent local or regional site. Using this power also tells you what direction you are facing.

      you succeed on a saving throw to negate the effect of a foe’s power on you, and the power is one that
      <i>leech field</i> is effective against (see below), your body erupts in a brief flash of crackling dark energy.
      You gain 1 power point for every 2 power points your foe spent to manifest the power you just saved against (to a
      maximum number of points equal to your manifester level). You cannot gain power points that would cause you to
      exceed your normal daily maximum.

      original hardness. When hardness increases, the object (or portion of an object) gains 3 hit points per inch of
      thickness for every point of increased hardness. When hardness decreases, the object (or portion of an object)
      loses 2 hit points per inch of thickness for every point of decreased hardness (to a minimum of 1 hit point per
      inch of thickness).
    </p>
    <p>You can’t decrease the hardness of an object that already has hardness 0.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Working Manipulated Metals:</em> An object or portion thereof whose hardness is decreased or increased is
      permanently changed. Even hardening adamantine to 25 is possible. You can also harden or weaken a preforged
      weapon, a suit of armor, or some other finished item.
    </p>
    <p><em>XP Cost:</em> 250 XP for each point by which the object’s hardness is altered.</p>

    <p>
      You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefits in an emergency. Manifesting the power
      is an immediate action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened
      power per round. You can use this power even when it’s not your turn; however, you must manifest it prior to an

    </ul>

    <p>
      You link your psychic might with other psionic creatures, creating an entity more powerful than the sum of its
      parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you manifest this power, a number of power points you designate flows from each participant into a collective
      pool. One individual is chosen as the <i>metaconcert</i> conductor by mutual consent of the other participants
      (this is usually the manifester, but doesn’t have to be). Until the power ends, this conductor directs the efforts
      of the group. Misty strands of glowing power link the brows of all the participants in a complex and shifting
      pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the powers of each participant are known to the mental entity ccreated with <i>metaconcert</i> (which is under
      the conductor’s command). This entity can’t take any more actions than a normal individual, but it manifests all
      its powers more effectively. Each participant contributing to the entity provides a cumulative +1 bonus to save
      DCs that apply when manifesting a power or using a psi-like ability. Likewise, each individual provides a
      cumulative +1 bonus when the entity makes its own saving throws in response to powers or psi-like abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the psionic entity takes ability damage from a psionic attackthe total is divided among all the members as
      determined by the conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the entity manifests a power that has an XP cost, all the participants pay an equal share (the conductor pays
      the remainder if the cost can’t be divided evenly).
    </p>
    <p>
      Once linked, the participants must remain within a 20-foot-radius area, and as a group can move at a speed of 10
      feet. If a participant moves outside the 20-foot-radius area occupied by the others (whether willingly or
      involuntarily), that individual drops out of the group, and the power point pool of the <i>metaconcert</i> is
      instantly recalculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      All participants who leave before a <i>metaconcert</i> ends or is dismissed reclaim a number of power points equal
      to the current power point pool divided by the number of members. If the conductor drops out, the power ends. That
      same number of points is removed from the power point pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a <i>metaconcert</i> ends normally or is dismissed, remaining power points in the pool are divided among all
      the participants (the conductor receives the remainder if the points can’t be divided evenly).

    </p>
    <p>
      This process gives you an uncannily accurate vision of the creature’s nature, activities, and whereabouts. When
      you manifest the power, you learn the following facts about the creature.

    <ul>
      <li>Its name, race, alignment, and character class.</li>

      <i>Metafaculty</i> can defeat spells, powers, and special abilities such as <i>screen</i> or <i>mind blank</i> (or

    <p>
      You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form, or any other type except construct,
      elemental, outsider, and undead. The assumed form can have as many Hit Dice as your manifester level, to a maximum
      of 15.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can’t assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you assume an incorporeal, ectoplasmic, or gaseous form. You
      cannot take the form of any creature that has a template. Your type and subtype (if applicable) change to match
      the new form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore
      ability damage and provide other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal you further). If you are
      slain while under the effect of this power, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead. You gain the
      Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and
      Charisma scores. You also gain all extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as constrict,
      improved grab, and poison) but do not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form (such as
      blindsense, fast healing, regeneration, and scent) or any supernatural, psionic, or spelllike abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and special qualities of your normal form, except for
      those requiring a body part that the new form does not have, if any. You keep all extraordinary special attacks
      and special qualities derived from class levels, but you lose any benefits of the racial traits of your normal
      form. If you have a template, special abilities it provides are likewise not retained. If the assumed form is
      capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any manifesting ability you had in your original form.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include
      natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with
      wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural
      weapons (such as claws or a bite), racial bonuses on skill checks, racial bonus feats, and any anatomical
      qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not
      allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can freely designate the new form’s minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin
      color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form’s significant physical qualities (such
      as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form’s
      species. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form’s race. If you use this power to
      create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the change occurs, your equipment either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or
      holding the item in question) or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your normal
      form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously
      occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can’t wear in your normal
      form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both
      forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or
      piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its normal form.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use this power to assume the form of an inanimate object. You gain the object’s hardness and retain
      your own hit points. You can take the shape of almost any simple object you can think of. If you attempt to take
      the form of a complex object, you must make an appropriate skill check.. If you fail the check, your manifestation
      of the power does not succeed. Likewise, you cannot take the form of a complex mechanical mechanism unless you
      have some sort of skill associated with the object. You cannot use this power to assume the form of a psionic item
      or a magic item, or any object with a hardness of 15 or higher. You also cannot take the form of a psionically
      animated mechanism or any object formed of ectoplasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an inanimate object, you lose all mobility. You retain your normal senses and your ability to speak. You can
      manifest a power if you make a Concentration check (DC 20 + power level); however, doing so ends the duration of
      this power. If you take damage while in the form of an object, your actual body also takes damage (but the
      object’s hardness, if any, protects you).

      As <i>metamorphosis</i>, except that this power enables you to assume the form of any single nonunique object or
      creature (of any type) from Fine to Colossal size. The assumed form cannot have more Hit Dice than twice your
      manifester level (to a maximum of 50 HD). Unlike <i>metamorphosis</i>, this power allows incorporeal, ectoplasmic,
      or gaseous forms to be assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You gain all extraordinary and supernatural abilities (both special attacks and special qualities) of the assumed
      form, but you lose your own supernatural abilities. You also gain the type of the new form (for example, dragon or
      magical beast) in place of your own. The new form does not disorient you. Parts of your body or pieces of
      equipment that are separated from you do not revert to their original form.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can become just about anything you are familiar with. You can change form once each round as a swift action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or immediately after it, but not during the
      action.

      This power enables you to warp the consciousness and senses of one or more creatures, sending the victim into a
      catatonic state. When
      <i>microcosm</i> is manifested, you can target either a single creature within range or a group of creatures all
      located within the power’s area.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Single Target:</em> If <i>microcosm</i> targets a single creature, that creature’s senses are pinched off from
      the real world if it currently has 100 or fewer hit points. The subject’s senses are all completely fabricated
      from within its own mind, though it may not realize this. In reality, the subject sprawls limply, drooling and
      mewling, and eventually dies of thirst and starvation without care. The subject lives within its own made-up world
      until the time of its actual death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Area Effect:</em> If <i>microcosm</i> is manifested on an area, it sends all affected creatures into a shared
      catatonia (the world is a construct, but within the world, the victims can interact with each other). It affects
      only creatures that currently have 30 or fewer hit points, and only up to a total of 300 hit points of such
      creatures. The power affects creatures with the lowest hit point totals first. (Creatures with negative hit points
      count as having 0 hit points.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Manifesting <i>microcosm</i> a second time on an affected creature turns its sensory pathways outward once more.
      Otherwise, only very potent powers (such as <i>psychic chirurgery</i> or <i>reality revision</i>) or similar
      effects (such as <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>) can undo the mental crosswiring that this power brings about.

      thoughts. This power protects against powers with the mind-affecting or scrying descriptors.
      <i>Psionic mind blank</i> even foils <i>bend reality, limited wish, miracle, reality revision,</i> and
      <i>wish</i> when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject’s mind or to gain information about it
      (however, <i>metafaculty</i> can pierce the protective quality of <i>psionic mind blank</i>). In the case of
      <i>remote viewing</i> or scrying that scans an area the creature is in, the effect works but the creature simply
      isn’t detected. <i>Remote viewing</i> (scrying) attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work
      at all.

      All the subject’s memories and knowledge are accessible to you, from memories deep below the surface to those
      still easily called to mind. You can learn the answer to one question per round, to the best of the subject’s
      knowledge. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, it is not required to answer the question; however, making a
      save does not end the power. You can ask the subject a new question (or the same question) in subsequent rounds
      for as long as the power’s duration persists.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can probe a sleeping subject and automatically get an answer to your question. If the subject then succeeds on
      a Will save, it wakes after providing the answer and thereafter can resist answering by making Will saves as
      described above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subjects that do not wish to be probed can attempt to move beyond the power’s range, unless they are somehow
      hindered. You pose the questions telepathically, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly to your
      mind. You and the subject do not need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up
      only appropriate visual images in answer to your questions.

      You impress the totality of your psyche into a subject’s subconscious. If successfully implanted, the seed of your
      mind “germinates” over the period of one week. During this time, the subject begins to unconsciously take on your
      mannerisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When integration is complete (after one week), the subject becomes you in mind as you were when you manifested the
      power, but the subject’s level is eight lower than your own. (In effect, the subject has received eight negative
      levels—but these are negative levels that can’t be removed.) The subject does not have any of your physical
      ability scores or equipment, but does have the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores you had when you were
      eight levels lower. The subject also knows the powers you knew when you were eight levels lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the subject is initially your mental duplicate, the two personalities diverge over time. Although the
      subject starts off with memories of your experiences, it possesses its original “soul” and physical body and is
      free to develop its own personality based on its own new experiences. Thus, the subject is not your slave or
      servant, but instead a nonplayer character in its own right that shares your earlier memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Protection from evil</i> or a similar spell or power can prevent you from implanting <i>mind seed,</i> or
      prevent a seed from germinating while the protective power lasts. Otherwise, a germinating seed can be removed
      (prior to germination) only by <i>psychic chirurgery, reality revision</i>, or similarly high-level effects.
      Manifesting <i>mind seed</i> again during the germination period also cleanses the subject’s mind.

      You can attempt to take control of a nearby living creature, forcing your mind (and soul) into its body, and its
      mind into your body. You can target any creature whose Hit Dice are equal to or less than your manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      You possess the target’s body and force the creature’s mind into your body unless it succeeds on a Will save. You
      can move your mind back into your own body whenever you desire, which returns the subject’s mind to its own body
      and ends the power. If the manifestation succeeds, your life force occupies the host body, and the host’s life
      force takes over yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can call on rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject creature, but not upon its acquired or learned
      knowledge (such as skills and feats it possesses). The same is true for the subject in your body. The
      <i>mind switch</i> brings about the following changes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You gain the type of your assumed body.</li>
      <li>You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of your assumed body.</li>
      <li>
        You gain the natural armor, natural attacks, movement, and other simple physical characteristics of your assumed
        body.
      </li>
      <li>
        You gain the extraordinary special attacks and qualities of your assumed body, but you do not gain supernatural
        or spell-like abilities.
      </li>
      <li>You gain the possessions and equipment of your assumed body.</li>
      <li>
        You retain your own hit points, saving throws (possibly modified by new ability scores), class abilities,
        supernatural and spell-like abilities, spells and powers, and skills and feats (although skill checks use your
        new ability scores, and you may be temporarily unable to use feats whose requirements you do not meet in your

    <p>Supernatural abilities that require a certain body part may be unavailable in your new form.</p>

      As <i>mind switch,</i> except as noted here. You permanently exchange bodies with the subject. Since this power’s
      duration is instantaneous, you cannot be forced to return to your natural body by means of
      <i>dispel psionics,</i> an <i>antimagic field,</i> or a similar effect. If the subject’s body dies while you are
      in it, you are dead. The subject immediately loses one level, but otherwise survives the experience in your
      natural body. If your natural body dies while the subject is in it, you immediately lose one level, but you
      likewise survive the experience in your new body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your “natural” body is always considered to be the last one you switched out of. If you exchange bodies with a
      chain of multiple subjects, you need worry only about the welfare of the last body you switched with. In other
      words, if your mind is expelled from your current body, your mind returns to the last body you switched with, not
      to your original body. Similarly, if your original body dies but you have since switched minds with a second
      subject, you take no penalty. You lose a level only if the body you inhabited immediately prior to your current
      body is killed.

      not share a common language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond
      is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).

      As <i>mindlink</i>, except that if the target is a psionic character or creature that knows powers, you can
      temporarily borrow a power of your choice (you are aware of what powers the subject knows, up to the highest level
      of power you can manifest).
    </p>
    <p>
      Borrowing the subject’s power is a separate standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. If that attack
      succeeds, the mental communication provided by this power ends immediately. The borrowed power fades from the
      subject’s awareness and appears within your own. You can now spend power points to manifest the borrowed power
      just as if it were one of your powers known. You maintain knowledge of the borrowed power until the duration of
      your <i>thieving mindlink</i> expires, at which time you lose knowledge of the power and the power reappears in
      the mind of the subject, no matter how far from you the subject is. Even if the subject is slain, you lose
      knowledge of the borrowed power when this power’s duration expires.

    <p>
      You partially wipe your victim’s mind of past experiences, bestowing two negative levels upon it. If the subject
      has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, it dies. For each negative level it gains, a psionic creature
      loses knowledge of one power from its highest available level, and a number of power points from its maximum power
      point total sufficient to manifest that power. The effects of multiple negative levels stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the subject survives, it loses these two negative levels after 1 hour. (No Fortitude save is necessary to avoid
      gaining the negative level permanently.)

    <p>
      An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most psionic
      effects, including powers, psi-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning
      of any psionic items or powers within its confines. A
      <i>null psionics field</i> suppresses any power or psionic effect used within, brought into, or manifested into
      its area, but does not negate it. Time spent within a <i>null psionics field</i> counts against a suppressed
      effect’s duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astral constructs and summoned creatures wink out if they enter a
      <i>null psionics field</i>. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts
      normally against the duration of the power that is maintaining the construct or summoned creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creation powers with instantaneous durations and calling powers are not affected by a
      <i>null psionics field</i> because the power itself is no longer in effect, only its result.
    </p>
    <p>
      A normal creature (a normally encountered construct rather than a created one, for instance) can enter the area,
      as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a psionic sword does not function psionically within the area, it is
      still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The power has no effect on golems and other constructs that are
      imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned
      or have a limited duration, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals,
      corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures’ spell-like or
      supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dispel psionics</i> does not remove the field. Two or more <i>null psionics fields</i> sharing any of the same
      space have no effect on each other. Certain powers may be unaffected by <i>null psionics field</i> (see the
      individual power descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal power such as this. Should a
      creature’s space extend across the boundary of the area enclosed by the field, any part of the creature that lies
      outside the effect is unaffected by the field.

    </ul>

    <p>This power transforms your body into living oak, which grants you several advantages.</p>
    <p>
      You gain damage reduction 10/ slashing and a +5 bonus to natural armor that overlaps (does not stack with) any
      natural armor bonus you may already have. You are immune to ability damage, blindness, deafness, disease,
      drowning, poison, stunning, and all powers, spells, or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because
      you have no physiology or respiration while this power is in effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      You take only half damage from cold effects of all kinds. However, you become susceptible to all special attacks
      that affect wood, and you gain vulnerability to fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but you take a –2 penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum Dexterity score
      of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You can speak but cannot drink (and thus can’t use potions) or
      play wind instruments. You have an armor check penalty of –4 and an arcane spell failure chance of 25%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters, 1d6 for Medium
      characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks. When you make a full attack against an
      object or structure using your unarmed strike, you deal double damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s duration increases by 1 minute.

    </ul>

    <p>
      You can learn details of an inanimate object’s previous owner. Objects accumulate psychic impressions left by
      their previous owners, which can be read by use of this power. The amount of information revealed depends on how
      long you study a particular object.
    </p>
    <p><em>1st Minute:</em> Last owner’s race.</p>
    <p><em>2nd Minute:</em> Last owner’s gender.</p>
    <p><em>3rd Minute:</em> Last owner’s age.</p>
    <p><em>4th Minute:</em> Last owner’s alignment.</p>
    <p><em>5th Minute:</em> How last owner gained and lost the object.</p>
    <p><em>6th+ Minute:</em> Next-to-last owner’s race, and so on.</p>
    <p>
      The power always correctly identifies the last owner of the item, and the original owner (if you keep the power
      active long enough).
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a 90% chance that this power will successfully identify all other former owners in sequence, but there is
      a 10% chance that one former owner will be skipped and thus not identified.
    </p>
    <p>
      This power will not identify casual users as owners. (Anyone who uses an object to attack someone or something is
      not thereafter considered a casual user.)
    </p>
    <p>
      An object without any previous owners reveals no information. You can continue to run through a list of previous
      owners and learn details about them as long as the power’s duration lasts. If you use this power additional times
      on the same object, the information yielded is the same as if you were using the power on the object for the first
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s maximum duration increases by
      10 minutes.

      <li><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> Yes</li>
      <li><strong>Power Points:</strong> 7</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You attempt to briefly partition the mind of your foe, calving off a minor personality that is antagonistic to the
      main personality. The parasitic personality functions with complete autonomy from the main personality. It does
      not control the body physically, but it can take one standard action each round that is purely mental, such as
      manifesting a power, in the same turn that the subject takes its normal actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parasitic personality manifests powers using the subject’s power point reserve and known powers, but can only
      manifest powers three or more levels lower than the highest level of power the subject can normally manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parasitic personality actively attempts to manifest powers that negatively impact the subject, using the
      highest-level powers possible (so as to deplete the subject’s power point reserve), and the most deadly to the
      subject. You do not have control over what the parasitic personality does, though it always works against the
      interest of the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both minds communicate with each other telepathically. If a creature is targeted by a compulsion or charm effect
      while under the effect of this power, it can make a second saving throw if the first one fails. If both saving
      throws fail, then this power ends and the creature is affected by the charm or compulsion effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parasitic personality does not gain any advantages if the main personality is subjected to a <i>haste</i> or
      <i>schism</i> effect.

      Your brow erupts with an arc of crackling dark energy that connects with your foe, draining it of 1d6 power points
      and adding 1 of those points to your reserve (unless that gain would cause you to exceed your maximum).

    <p>
      The drain continues in each round you maintain concentration while the subject of the drain remains in range. If
      the subject is drained to 0 power points, this power ends.

      Concentrating to maintain <i>power leech</i> is a full-round action (you can take no other actions aside from a
      5-foot step) instead of a standard action.

    <p>
      <i>Precognition</i> allows your mind to glimpse fragments of potential future events—what you see will probably
      happen if no one takes action to change it. However, your vision is incomplete, and it makes no real sense until
      the actual events you glimpsed begin to unfold. That’s when everything begins to come together, and you can act,
      if you act swiftly, on the information you previously received when you manifested this power.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, manifesting this power grants you a “precognitive edge.” Normally, you can have only a single
      precognitive edge at one time. You must use your edge within a period of no more than 10 minutes per level, at
      which time your preknowledge fades and you lose your edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use your precognitive edge in a variety of ways. Essentially, the edge translates into a +2 insight bonus
      that you can apply at any time to either an attack roll, a damage roll, a saving throw, or a skill check. You can
      elect to apply the bonus to the roll after you determine that your unmodified roll is lower than desired.

      The air ripples with the force of your mental attack, which blasts the minds of all creatures in range.
      <i>Psionic blast</i> stuns all affected creatures for 1 round.

    <p>
      You gain the powerful charging ability of a lion. When you charge, you can make a full attack in the same round.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power as you
      charge. Manifesting the power is a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the
      normal limit of one quickened power per round. You cannot manifest this power when it isn’t your turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend, each of your attacks after a charge in the
      current round gains a circumstance bonus on damage equal to the number of additional points spent.

      A <i>psionic lock</i> manifested upon a door, chest, or portal psionically locks it. You can freely pass your own
      lock without affecting it; otherwise, a door or object secured with <i>psionic lock</i> can be opened only by
      breaking in or by a successful <i>dispel psionics</i> effect. Add +10 to the normal DC to break open a door or

      are immune to psionics or magic cannot be repaired in this fashion.

      <i>Psionic revivify</i> lets a manifester reconnect a corpse’s psyche with its body, restoring life to a recently
      deceased creature. The power must be manifested within 1 round of the victim’s death. Before the psyche of the
      deceased has completely left the body, this power halts its journey while repairing somewhat the damage to the
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      This power functions like the <i>raisedead</i> spell, except that the affected creature receives no level loss, no
      Constitution loss, and no loss of powers.
    </p>
    <p>The creature has –1 hit points (but is stable) after being restored to life.</p>
    <p><em>XP Cost:</em> 200 XP.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> For every 100 additional experience points that both you and the subject pay, the
      manifestation of this power can be delayed by 1 additional round.

    <p>
      You gain an enhanced sense of smell, equivalent to the scent ability of some monsters. This ability allows you to
      detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. With the scent ability, you can
      identify familiar odors just as humanoids do familiar sights.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60
      feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice
      the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple
      normal range.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you detect a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere within
      range. You can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever you come within 5 feet of the
      source, you pinpoint the source’s location.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have the Track feat, you can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow
      a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC
      increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the
      trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for
      the Track feat. If you are tracking with
      <i>psionic scent,</i> you ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.

    </ul>

    <p>
      You can repair psychic damage or grant another creature knowledge of powers you know, depending on the version of
      this power you manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Repair Psychic Damage:</em> You can remove any compulsions and charms affecting the subject. In fact, you can
      remove any instantaneous or permanent effect caused by a psychic power with <i>psychic chirurgery</i>. Unlike with
      <i>aura alteration</i>, these effects end or are negated as soon as this power is manifested, with no need for
      another saving throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can remove all negative levels affecting the subject, regardless of how it lost those levels, restoring it to
      the highest level it had previously attained. Also, you can restore levels lost to energy drain or a similar
      effect if the level drain occurred within a number of hours equal to your manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also remove all psionic effects penalizing the subject’s ability scores, heal all ability damage, and
      remove any ability drain affecting the subject. <i>Psychic chirurgery</i>negates all forms of insanity, confusion,
      the effect of such powers as <i>microcosm,</i> and so on, but it does not restore levels or Constitution points
      lost due to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Transfer Knowledge:</em> If desired, you can use this power to directly transfer knowledge of a power you know
      to another psionic character. You can give a character knowledge of a power of any level that she can manifest,
      even if the power is not normally on the character’s power list. Knowledge of powers gained through
      <i>psychic chirurgery</i> does not count toward the maximum number of powers a character can know per level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>XP Cost:</em> Each time you use psychic chirurgery to implant knowledge of a power in another creature, you
      pay an XP cost equal to 1,000 x the level of the power implanted. If you and the subject are both willing to do
      so, you can split this cost evenly.

      Your will abruptly and brutally crushes the mental essence of any one creature, debilitating its acumen. The

      succeeds on the save, it takes 3d6 points of damage.

    <p>
      When this power is manifested, the subject can choose to spend its most recently gained skill points differently
      (picking new skills and abandoning old ones if it chooses) and to choose a different feat from the one it selected
      when advancing from its previous level to its current level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject can also choose to forget powers it acquired when advancing to its current level, replacing them with
      new ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject can undo decisions of these sorts that were made at lower levels, if both the subject and the
      manifester agree to pay the necessary XP before this power is manifested (see below). The subject must abide by
      the standard rules for selecting skills and feats, and so it cannot take feats for which it doesn’t qualify or
      take crossclass skills as class skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>XP Cost:</em> This power costs 50 XP to manifest to reformat choices made when the character reached her
      current level. For each additional previous level into which the revision reaches, the power costs an additional
      50 XP. The manifester and subject split all XP costs evenly.

      This power shrouds your hand or a natural weapon you possess with darkness that you can use to drain an opponent’s
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you manifest this power to affect your hand, the next successful melee touch attack you make (if the victim
      fails its Fortitude save) drains 2 power points from your foe for every manifester level you have. The drained
      points simply dissipate. Your touch attack, charged with psionic power, is treated as an armed attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you manifest this power to affect a natural weapon you possess, you must make a successful melee attack with
      the weapon to gain the power’s benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against a psionic being that has no power points or a nonpsionic foe, your attack instead deals 2 points of
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (your choice).

      You can readjust your body to boost one physical ability score at the expense of one or more other scores. Select
      one ability score you would like to boost, and increase it by the same amount that you decrease one or more other
      scores. All score decreases are treated as a special form of ability damage, called ability burn, which cannot be
      magically or psionically healed—it goes away only through natural healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can boost your Strength, Dexterity or Constitution score by an amount equal to your manifester level (or any
      lesser amount), assuming you can afford to burn your other ability scores to such an extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the duration of this power expires, your ability boost also ends, but your ability burn remains until it is
      healed naturally.
