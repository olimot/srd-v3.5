    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Metacreativity (Creation)</li>
      <li><strong>Level:</strong> Shaper 4</li>
      <li><strong>Display:</strong> Material; see text</li>
      <li><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 round</li>
      <li><strong>Range:</strong> 0 ft.</li>
      <li><strong>Effect:</strong> 1-inch-diameter dollop of quintessence; see text</li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</li>
      <li><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None</li>
      <li><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> No</li>
      <li><strong>Power Points:</strong> 7</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You collapse a bit of time from the continuum, forming a 1-ounce dollop of thick, gooey material called
      quintessence. This substance shimmers like a silver mirror when viewed from some angles but is transparent from
      other viewpoints. You can smooth a dollop of quintessence around any extremely small object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects sealed within quintessence are protected from the effects of time; in practical terms, they enter a state
      of stasis. Living flesh with only partial contact with quintessence is also partially pulled out of the time
      stream (the manifester is immune to this effect). This disruption deals 1 point of damage per round beginning 10
      rounds after partial contact occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quintessence can be manually scraped away from a protected object, freeing it to rejoin the time stream. When you
      do this, there is a 75% chance that the quintessence evaporates back into the continuum. Otherwise, it coalesces
      again into a 1-inch-diameter bead, available for later use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Large quantities of quintessence could theoretically be gathered to preserve large items or structures (or even a
      complete living creature; if completely immersed, a living creature would not take the damage associated with
      partial contact). However, psionic characters and creatures are generally loath to do so because accumulations of
      quintessence weighing 1 pound or more hinder psionic activity within a 5-foot radius of the accumulation: Powers
      require twice as many power points to manifest, unless the manifester makes a successful Will save each time he or
      she attempts to manifest a power. Also in these circumstances, manifesting a psi-like ability that is usable at
      will is a full-round action rather than a standard action.

    <h2 id="read-thoughts">Read Thoughts</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]</li>
      <li><strong>Level:</strong> Telepath 2</li>
      <li><strong>Display:</strong> Mental</li>
      <li><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</li>
      <li><strong>Range:</strong> 60 ft.</li>
      <li><strong>Area:</strong> Cone-shaped emanation centered on you</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      You know the surface thoughts of the mind of any creature in the area that fails a Will save. A target that
      succeeds on its save is not affected by this manifestation of the power, even if it leaves the area and then
      reenters the area before the duration expires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures of animal intelligence have simple, instinctual thoughts that you can pick up. If you read the thoughts
      of a creature with an Intelligence of 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own Intelligence
      score), you are stunned for 1 round and the power ends. This power does not let you pinpoint the location of an
      affected mind if you don’t have line of sight to the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each round, you can turn to use this power in a new area. The power can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1
      inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

    <h2 id="reality-revision">Reality Revision</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Clairsentience</li>
      <li><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/wilder 9</li>
      <li><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> See text</li>

      <li><strong>Power Points:</strong> 17, XP</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As <i>bend reality</i>, but with more farreaching effects. A <i>reality revision</i> can produce any one of the
      following effects.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Duplicate any psion power of 8th level or lower, provided the power is not prohibited to you.</li>
      <li>Duplicate any other power (but not a spell) of 6th level or lower, such as a psychic warrior power.</li>
      <li>Duplicate any psion power of 7th level or lower even if it’s a power prohibited to you.</li>
      <li>
        Undo the harmful effects of many other powers, such as
        <i>microcosm, geas/quest,</i> or <i>insanity</i>.
      </li>
      <li>Create a nonpsionic item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</li>
      <li>Create a psionic item, or add to the powers of an existing psionic item (see XP cost below).</li>
      <li>
        Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five
        <i>reality revisions</i> manifested in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an
        ability score. Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be negated or dispelled. An inherent bonus
        cannot exceed +5 for a single ability score. Inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack; only
        the best one applies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove injuries and afflictions. A single <i>reality revision</i> can aid one creature per manifester level, and
        all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction.<br /><i>Reality revision</i> can not restore the
        experience point loss from manifesting a power or casting a spell, or the level or Constitution loss from being
        returned to life by those effects that reduce level or Constitution.
      </li>
      <li>
        Revive the dead. <i>Reality revision</i> can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a
        <i>resurrection</i> spell. This power can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task
        takes two manifestations of <i>reality revision</i>, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body
        with life again. <i>Reality revision</i> cannot prevent a character who is brought back to life from losing a
        level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transport travelers. This power can lift one creature per manifester level from anywhere on any plane and place
        those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save
        to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Undo misfortune. <i>Reality revision</i> can undo a single recent event. Manifesting the power forces a reroll
        of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the
        new result. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a
        Will save to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can try to use <i>reality revision</i> to produce more powerful effects than these, but doing so is dangerous.
      The manifestation may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial
      fulfillment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duplicated powers allow saves and power resistance as normal (but save DCs are calculated as though the power is
      9th level).
    </p>
    <p><em>XP Cost:</em> The minimum XP cost for manifesting <i>reality revision</i> is 5,000</p>
    <p>
      XP. When a manifestation duplicates a power that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is
      more. When a manifestation creates or improves a psionic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting
      or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.

      reverse any power with a range of touch.

      When others use <i>clairvoyant sense</i>, <i>remote viewing</i>, or other means of scrying you from afar, your
      prepared trap gives them a nasty surprise. If the scryer fails its saving throw, you are undetected. Moreover, the
      would-be observer takes 8d6 points of electricity damage. If the scryer makes its saving throw, it takes only 4d6
      points of electricity damage and is able to observe you normally. Either way, you are aware of the attempt to view
      you, but not of the viewer or the viewer’s location. It is possible that you might recognize the quasireal
      viewpoint of someone using the <i>remote viewing</i> power if you could pierce its <i>invisibility</i> (which is
      true for <i>remote viewing</i> whether or not you use this power).

      You send your mind across space and dimensions, forming it into a quasireal viewpoint from which you can see and
      hear some creature located at any distance from you, even if planar boundaries separate you. If the subject
      succeeds on a Will save, the <i>remote viewing</i> attempt fails, and you can’t attempt to view that creature
      again for at least 24 hours. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of
      physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a
      +5 bonus on its Will save.

    <p>
      If the subject fails its Will save, your mind coalesces a quasi-real viewpoint near enough to the subject to see
      and hear the subject and its immediate surroundings (up 30 feet in all directions away from the subject).
    </p>
    <p>
      While the <i>remote viewing</i> lasts, your real body remains unmoving and unaware of your actual surroundings. On
      the other hand, your quasi-real viewpoint is treated in some ways as if it were an invisible
      <i>ectoplasmic form</i> of yourself, except as follows. This power is of the Scrying subdiscipline, but use the
      following information in place of the standard scrying sensor. As a quasi-real viewpoint, you can speak (though
      your voice is whispery).
    </p>
    <p>
      You may potentially be sensed by the subject of your viewing (subjects who can see or sense invisible or hidden
      creatures automatically sense you; otherwise you make a Hide check with a +40 bonus to escape detection if
      immobile, or a +20 bonus if moving). You could be attacked (although if you become subject to
      <i>dispel psionics</i>, the <i>remote viewing</i> simply ends). If the subject moves, you can attempt to follow it
      at a speed of 20 feet, though if it gets farther than 30 feet from you (or you move farther than 30 feet from it),
      the power ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can attempt to manifest one power through your quasi-real viewpoint, but you must make a Concentration check
      (DC 20 + level of the power you wish to manifest) to succeed. Manifesting (or attempting and failing to manifest)
      a power immediately ends the <i>remote viewing.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, all powers from your quasi-real viewpoint cost twice the usual number of power points (you can’t
      exceed the power point limit set by your manifester level, so you are restricted to manifesting lower-level powers
      than you otherwise could). Power points you spend as a quasireal viewpoint are drained from your real body.

      This power cures all ability damage, and it restores all points drained from a single ability score (your choice
      if more than one score is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target.
      <i>Restoration</i> does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Restoration</i> can remove negative levels. It can also restore one level to a creature who has had a level
      drained, if the number of days since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than your manifester level.
      In such a case, <i>restoration</i> brings the creature up to the minimum number of experience points necessary to
      advance it to the next higher level, gaining it an additional Hit Die and level benefits accordingly.

      You restore a severed extremity to a creature that has lost a digit, hand, arm, leg, or even its head. This power
      does not restore life, but it returns a lost extremity to a living or dead creature if the creature is otherwise
      mostly intact. The original extremity need not be present when this power is manifested; a new extremity is
      created by the power. If a head is restored to a body, the original head (if not already destroyed) loses all
      spark of identity, and can be considered so much dead tissue.

      Your mind splits into two independent parts. Each part functions in complete autonomy, like two characters in one
      body. Your new “second mind” does not control your body physically but is free to take one standard action in each
      round if the action is purely mental (such as manifesting a power) in the same round you take your normal actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your second mind can manifest powers using your power point reserve, but only as if your manifester level were six
      lower than it is. Your second mind doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity when manifesting a power, because doing
      so doesn’t distract your primary mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your second mind takes its first action on your turn in the round after
      <i>schism</i> is manifested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both your minds communicate with each other telepathically. If you are subject to a compulsion or charm effect
      while you are of two minds, make a second saving throw if you fail the first. If you fail both, then the
      <i>schism</i> ends and you are affected normally by the power. If you fail just one, the <i>schism</i> ends
      immediately, but you are not subject to the compulsion or charm.

      You perceive what the subject creature perceives using its sight, hearing, taste, or smell. Only one sense is
      linked, and you cannot switch between senses with the same manifestation.

    <p>
      You make any skill checks involving senses, such as Spot or Listen, as the subject, and only within the subject’s

    </p>
    <p>
      Once <i>sense link</i> is manifested, the link persists even if the subject moves out of the range of the original

      with it by means of this power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strength of the subject’s linked sense could be enhanced by other powers or items, allowing you the same
      enhanced sense. You are subject to any gaze attack affecting the subject creature (if you linked vision). If you
      are blinded or deafened, or suffer some other sensory deprivation, the linked creature functions as an independent
      sensory organ, and provides you the benefit of the linked sense from its perspective while this power’s duration

      You gain historical vision in a given location. Rooms, streets, tunnels, and other discrete locations accumulate
      psychic impressions left by powerful emotions experienced in a given area. These impressions offer you a picture
      of the location’s past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The types of events most likely to leave psychic impressions are those that elicited strong emotions: battles and
      betrayals, marriages and murders, births and great pain, or any other event where one emotion dominates. Everyday
      occurrences leave no residue for a manifester to detect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vision of the event is dreamlike and shadowy. You do not gain special knowledge of those involved in the
      vision, though you might be able to read large banners or other writing if they are in your language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginning with the most recent significant event at a location and working backward in time, you can sense one
      distinct event for every 10 minutes you maintain concentration, if any such events exist to be sensed. Your

      You, another willing creature, or an unattended object can slide along solid ground as if on smooth ice. If you
      manifest <i>skate</i> on yourself or another creature, the subject of the power retains equilibrium by mental
      desire alone, allowing her to gracefully skate along the ground, turn, or stop suddenly as desired. The skater’s
      land speed increases by 15 feet. (This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.) As with any effect that
      increases speed, this power affects the subject’s maximum jumping distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject can skate up or down any incline or decline she could normally walk upon without mishap, though
      skating up an incline reduces the subject’s speed to normal, while skating down a decline increases her speed by
      an additional 15 feet. (This adjustment is treated as a circumstance bonus.)

      You gain the ability to siphon away your enemy’s strength for your own use. One of your natural or manufactured
      weapons becomes the instrument of your desire, and deals 1 point of Strength damage on each successful hit. You
      gain that point of Strength as an enhancement bonus to your Strength score. Strength you siphon from different
      foes is tracked separately—the total siphoned from each individual foe is considered a separate enhancement bonus
      to your Strength (maximum +8), and you gain only the highest total.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.</p>
    <p>
      1. For every 3 additional power points you spend, the maximum enhancement bonus you can add to your Strength
      increases by 2.
    </p>

      You can place yourself into a trance so deep that you are almost in suspended animation. Even powers that detect
      life or thought are incapable of determining that you are alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      While you are suspended, you are aware of your surroundings. You feel the passage of one day for every year that
      actually passes. Though on a slower schedule, you grow hungry after a “day” without food (though a year passes in
      actuality) and begin to suffer the effects of thirst and starvation as appropriate.

      If you take any damage, you come out of your trance 4 rounds later. The trance can also be ended by a successful

      You receive one kind of sensory input when a different sense is stimulated. In particular, you can either feel
      light or feel sound. You can shift your stimulated sense between these two options once per round as a swift
      action. Your senses continue to work normally as well, unless they are impaired for some reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your face must be uncovered to use this power, because it is the skin of your face that acts as the sensory
      receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are feeling light by absorbing ambient light onto your skin, you have your normal visual abilities (except
      for darkvision), even if your eyes are closed or you are blinded. If your eyes are working normally, you gain a +4
      circumstance bonus on all Spot and Search checks. While feeling light, you are immune to gaze attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are feeling sound by absorbing sound onto your skin and your ears are working normally, the expanded audio
      input provides you with a +4 circumstance bonus on Listen checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psionic or magical displacement effects, invisibility effects, illusions, and other similar effects confuse your
      <i>synesthete</i> senses just as they would your normal senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use this power to see sound if you are deafened, or hear light if you are blinded, thus removing all
      penalties associated with either condition (though you gain no bonuses for using the power in this way if you are
      not deafened or blinded).

      <li><strong>Power Points:</strong> 5</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You move an object by concentrating your mind upon its current location and then the location you desire, creating
      a sustained force. You can move an object weighing no more than 250 pounds up to 20 feet per round. A creature can
      negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with power resistance. The weight can
      be moved across the ground or through the air. This power ends if the object is forced out of range. If you cease
      concentration, the object falls or stops.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can drop a weight and pick up another during the power’s duration, as long as you don’t stop concentrating on
      maintaining the power. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if you were moving it with one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you spend at least 5 rounds concentrating on an unattended object, you can attempt to break or burst it as if
      making a Strength check, except that you apply your key ability modifier to the check instead of your Strength
      modifier.

      You can affect a foe by concentrating your mind upon its current status and the status you desire, once per round.
      You can perform a bull rush, a disarm, a grapple (including a pin), or a trip. Resolve these attempts as normal,
      except that they don’t provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your manifester level in place of your base attack
      bonus (for disarm and grapple attempts), you use your Intelligence modifier in place of your Strength modifier or
      Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn’t allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as normally allowed
      on disarm or trip attempts). No save is allowed against these attempts, but power resistance applies normally.
    </p>

      <strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power grants a +1 bonus on your

      You can affect one or more objects or creatures by concentrating your mind upon, sending them in a deadly hail at
      your foes—or simply by hurling your foe! You can hurl one object or creature per manifester level (maximum fifteen
      separate targets), as long as all are within the power’s range and each is no more than 10 feet away from another
      one. Each object or creature can be hurled a maximum distance of 10 feet per level.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must succeed on ranged attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target of the hurled items
      with the items, applying your Intelligence modifier to the attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier. Hurled
      weapons deal their standard damage (your Strength bonus does not apply; arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of
      their size when used in this manner). Other objects deal damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds of weight (for
      less dangerous objects such as an empty barrel) to 1d6 points per 25 pounds of weight (for hard, dense objects
      such as a boulder).
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures are allowed Will saves (and power resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions
      are targeted by this power.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use this power to hurl a creature against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6
      points).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend, the weight limit of the target or targets
      increases by 25 pounds.

    <p>
      You enter another time frame, speeding up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are
      actually still moving at normal speed. You are free to act for 1 round of apparent time. You can manifest powers,
      cast spells, move, or perform other types of actions, subject to the restrictions outlined below.
    </p>
    <p>
      While your <i>temporal acceleration</i> is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and powers.
      This means you cannot target a creature with any attack or power. However, a power you manifest that affects an
      area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of your <i>temporal acceleration</i> has its normal
      effect on creatures in the area once this power ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can affect an unattended object but not an object held, carried, or worn by another creature. You are
      undetectable by any means while your
      <i>temporal acceleration</i> lasts.

    <p>
      While under the effect of this power, you cannot enter an area protected by a <i>null psionics field</i> or by a
      power or spell that neutralizes high-level powers or spells. Normal and magical fire, cold, acid, and the like can
      still harm you.

      When your <i>temporal acceleration</i> expires, you resume acting during your current turn in the standard time
      frame. You are shaken for 1 round upon your return to the standard time frame.

      Splintered or partitioned minds within your own mind, such as might be in effect through the use of powers such as

      gains the benefit, while your second mind remains stuck in the standard time frame).

      Manifesting this power is a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal
      limit of one quickened power per round. You cannot manifest this power when it isn’t your turn.

      The subject of the power hops forward in time 1 round for every manifester level you have. In effect, the subject
      seems to disappear in a shimmer of silver energy, then reappear after the duration of this power expires. The
      subject reappears in exactly the same orientation and condition as before. From the subject’s point of view, no
      time has passed at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In each round of the power’s duration, on what would have been the subject’s turn, it can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom
      check. Success allows the subject to return. The subject can act normally on its next turn after this power ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the space from which the subject departed is occupied upon his return to the time stream, he appears in the
      closest unoccupied space, still in his original orientation. Determine the closest space randomly if necessary.

    <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.</p>

      You can regress apparent time 1 round into the past. In effect, you “replay” the previous round of activity. The
      power regresses time to the point along the time stream just prior to your previous turn, undoing the effects of
      everyone else’s actions in the meantime. Once you have used
      <i>time regression,</i> only you retain knowledge of what happened during the round that is being replayed;
      however, you can communicate that knowledge verbally to your companions, if desired. During the round that you
      live through a second time, you can act on knowledge you previously gained by already living through the immediate
      future. In all likelihood, you’ll probably not choose to manifest <i>time regression</i> during your second pass
      through the time stream, instead taking completely new actions, but you pay the XP cost all the same.

      You induce the formation of a slender vortex of fiercely swirling air. When you manifest it, a vortex of air
      visibly and audibly snakes out from your outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to aim the vortex at a specific creature, you can make a ranged touch attack to strike the creature.
      If you succeed, direct contact with the vortex deals 8d6 points of damage to the creature (no save).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of whether your ranged touch attack hits (and even if you forgo the attack), all creatures in the area
      (including the one possibly damaged by direct contact) are picked up and violently dashed about, dealing 17d6
      points of damage to each one. Creatures that make a successful Reflex save take half damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      After being dashed about, each creature that was affected finds itself situated in a new space 1d4 x 10 feet away
      from its original space in a random direction. Walls and other barriers can restrict this relocation; in such a
      case, the creature ends up adjacent to the barrier.

      <strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend, this power’s area damage (not the damage
      from direct contact dealt to a specific creature) increases by 1d6 points (to a maximum of 24d6 points). For each
      extra 2d6 points of damage, this power’s save DC increases by 1.

      You generate a subtle telekinetic field of mental contact, allowing you to “feel” your surroundings even in total
      darkness or when your sight would otherwise be obscured by your physical environment. Your
      <i>touchsight</i> field emanates from you out to 60 feet. You ignore invisibility, darkness, and concealment,
      though you must have line of effect to a creature or an object to discern it. You do not need to make Spot or
      Listen checks to notice creatures; you can detect and pinpoint all creatures within 60 feet. In many
      circumstances, comparing your regular senses to what you learn with <i>touchsight</i> is enough to tell you the

      wall has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5. A section of the wall whose hit points drop to 0 is
      breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 2 per inch of
      thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>wall of ectoplasm</i> is susceptible to <i>dispel psionics</i>, but it gains a +4 bonus on any check to
      determine whether the wall is negated. Spells, powers, and breath weapons cannot pass through the wall in either
      direction (though they could damage it). It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures (though
      ethereal creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and
      ceilings). The wall is opaque, so neither vision nor gaze attacks operate through it. The wall does not block
      psychoportive travel, such as that provided by the <i>psionic teleport</i> power.

      You can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square per level or into a
      sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 1 foot per level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>wall of ectoplasm</i> must be continuous and unbroken when manifested. If its surface is interrupted by any
      object or creature, the power fails.

      You can walk on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings (you need not make Climb checks to traverse these
      surfaces). Because of the need to keep at least one foot in contact with the wall or ceiling at all times, you
      cannot jump or use the run action, and you can move at only half speed.

    <p>You retain your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, if any, and opponents gain no special bonuses against you.</p>
