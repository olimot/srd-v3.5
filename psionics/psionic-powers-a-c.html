    <p>
      Your body automatically adapts to hostile environments. You can adapt to underwater, extremely hot, extremely
      cold, or airless environments, allowing you to survive as if you were a creature native to that environment. You
      can breathe and move (though penalties to movement and attacks, if any for a particular environment, remain), and
      you take no damage simply from being in that environment. You need not specify what environment you are adapting
      to when you manifest this power; simply activate it, and your body will instantly adapt to any hostile environment
      as needed throughout the duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can somewhat adapt to extreme environmental features such as acid, lava, fire, and electricity. Any
      environmental feature that normally directly deals 1 or more dice of damage per round deals you only half the
      usual amount of damage.

    <h2 id="affinity-field">Affinity Field</h2>

    <p>
      You create an affinity feedback loop with all creatures within the area. While the duration lasts, affected
      creatures take all damage (including ability damage) as you do and heal all wounds as you do. Hit points gained or
      lost persist after this power ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures in range are also subject to magical and psionic effects of 3rd level or lower. Creatures that have an
      affinity to you gain a saving throw against each new power transferred through the <i>affinity field</i> as if the
      power were manifested upon them normally. All magical and psionic effects transferred to subjects fade at the end
      of this power’s duration, although instantaneous effects remain. If you suddenly become immune to a particular
      effect or power, the effect or power to which you are immune cannot be transferred to creatures that have affinity
      to you.

    <h2 id="anchored-navigation">Anchored Navigation</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Clairsentience</li>
      <li><strong>Level:</strong> Seer 4</li>
      <li><strong>Display:</strong> Material and olfactory</li>
      <li><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</li>
      <li><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</li>

      <li><strong>Power Points:</strong> 7</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You know where you are in relation to a fixed starting point, which is essential for setting up a mishap-free
      <i>teleport</i> beacon. While the duration lasts, you are aware of your exact distance and route (physical or
      psychoportive) back to a fixed starting point. The “anchored” starting point is your exact location when you
      manifest the power. To designate other anchored starting points, you must manifest this power multiple times and
      be present at the desired locations when you do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also retrace your steps through a maze automatically while the power lasts, without resorting to a map.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Anchored navigation</i> grants you a <i>mindlink</i> with one designated creature who remains within a 60-foot
      radius of the starting point, regardless of the distance between you and the creature. The use of
      <i>anchored navigation</i> is confined to the plane of existence where you manifest it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 6 additional power points, the effect of this power extends across all
      planar boundaries.

    <p>
      You forge a psychometabolic affinity with an idealized animal form, thereby boosting one of your ability scores
      (choose either Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). The power grants a +4
      enhancement bonus to the ability score you choose, adding the usual benefits provided by a high ability bonus.
      Because you are emulating the idealized form of an animal, you also take on minor aspects of the animal you
      choose. If you choose to increase the ability you use to manifest powers, you do not gain the benefit of an
      increased ability score long enough to gain any bonus power points for a high ability score, but the save DCs of
      your powers increase for the duration of this power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> For every 5 additional power points you spend, this power grants a +4 enhancement bonus
      to another ability.

      By using this power, you delete 1d4 powers permanently from the subject’s mind. You specify the level of each
      power, and the DM randomly determines which of the subject’s powers is actually deleted.
      <i>Psychic chirurgery</i> or <i>reality revision</i> can be used to restore the lost powers, but it must be
      performed within 1 week of losing the powers.

      Your pointing finger turns black as obsidian. A creature touched by you is partially assimilated into your form
      and takes 20d6 points of damage. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this power is killed, entirely
      assimilated into your form, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. An assimilated creature’s equipment is
      unaffected.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature that is partially assimilated into your form (that is, a creature that has at least 1 hit point
      following your use of this power) grants you a number of temporary hit points equal to half the damage you dealt
      for 1 hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature that is completely assimilated grants you a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you
      dealt and a +4 bonus to each of your ability scores for 1 hour. If the assimilated creature knows psionic powers,
      you gain knowledge of one of its powers for 1 hour. You gain some semblance of a creature you completely
      assimilate for 1 hour, granting you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks made to appear as that creature during that
      time.

    <h2 id="astral-caravan">Astral Caravan</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Psychoportation</li>
      <li><strong>Level:</strong> Nomad 3</li>
      <li><strong>Display:</strong> None</li>
      <li><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 hour</li>
      <li><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</li>
      <li><strong>Targets:</strong> You and touched willing creatures</li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> See text</li>
      <li><strong>Power Points:</strong> 5</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You lead a caravan into the Astral Plane, leaving the Material Plane behind. Since the Astral Plane touches upon
      other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you wish, but only if you know your way (see
      below).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can bring other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects have each manifested
      <i>astral traveler</i> and are linked hand to hand with you at the time of the <i>astral caravan</i>’s
      manifestation. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something
      happens to you during the journey that causes you to break hand-to-hand contact, your companions are stranded
      wherever you leave them. Because the planes are a dangerous place, those who lead <i>astral caravans</i> usually
      choose to manifest this power only if they have a large party of travelers assembled. Sometimes groups of
      lower-level adventurers may hire you to lead forays beyond the Material Plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>astral caravan</i> power lasts while you and your fellow travelers maintain your original formation, until
      (1) you reach your intended destination plane, (2) you desire to end the power while still traversing the Astral
      Plane, (3) you or anyone traveling with you breaks the hand-to-hand chain connecting the travelers for 2
      consecutive rounds, or (4) the power is terminated by some outside means, such as <i>dispel psionics</i>. When the
      power ends, you and your fellow travelers halt in whatever portion of the Astral Plane you happen to be traversing
      (the Astral Plane is in many ways subjective in location; in any event, one place on the Astral looks much like
      any other).
    </p>
    <p>
      While you are traveling through the Astral Plane, those natives who happen to glimpse you and your fellow
      travelers perceive you to be moving at a speed of 30 feet (you can’t run), with you flying in the lead and your
      fellow travelers strung out behind you, each linked to the next by one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on your knowledge of the planes, your journey through the subjective space that is the Astral Plane may
      take a longer or shorter period of time. For each 24 hours you travel, make a Knowledge (the planes) check. Unless
      a location is particularly hard to find and well guarded, or conversely easy to find and well advertised, the
      average DC for an <i>astral caravan</i> journey should be set at 20. You cannot take 20 on this check, though you
      can take 10. Each check may be modified by your degree of familiarity with the destination or by some connection
      you have with the place; see the tables below.

      Each successful check indicates that you are one step closer to your goal. To finally arrive at your location, you
      must succeed on six checks within a span of 12 days. (If you fail to make six successful checks within the first
      12 days, you can continue to make one check per day until you get the requisite six successes within a span of 12
      consecutive days). When you successfully make the requisite number of checks, the journey ends, and you appear on
      your chosen plane within 10–1,000 (1d% x 10) miles of your intended destination on that plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 2 additional power points, this power weaves a quasi-real filmy membrane
      around yourself and all those adjacent to each other in the caravan (being linked by hand is not required if this
      membrane is used). You remain visible within the translucent, amorphous enclosure. You can pick up or drop willing
      passengers, easily reaching through the film. Anything you hold is enveloped by the film. Any attacks made through
      the enclosure in either direction have a 25% miss chance due to the rippling membrane.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you manifest this power in its augmented form, your apparent speed to those observing on the Astral Plane is
      40 feet, and you can make a Knowledge (the planes) check once every 12 hours to attempt to make it to your
      destination (six successful checks within 12 consecutive days still sees you to your desired goal).

    <p>
      This power creates one 1st-level astral construct of solidified ectoplasm that attacks your enemies. It appears
      where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. As a
      free action, you can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
      The astral construct acts normally on the last round of the power’s duration and dissipates at the end of its
      turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astral constructs are not summoned; they are created on the plane you inhabit (using ectoplasm drawn from the
      Astral Plane). Thus, they are not subject to effects that hedge out or otherwise affect outsiders; they are
      constructs, not outsiders.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you spend, the level of the astral construct
      increases by one.

    <p>
      This power weaves strands of astral ectoplasm into a crystal containing the seed of your living mind (hardness 1
      and 1 hit point). You can have only one <i>astral seed</i> in existence at any one time. Until such time as you
      perish, the <i>astral seed</i> (also called the storage crystal) is utterly inert. If you are slain at some later
      date, your soul transfers into the storage crystal, which begins to dimly glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon transference, your physical remains (should they still exist) become inert matter and cannot thereafter be
      restored to life. The transfer from the slain body to the <i>astral seed</i> works over any distance, physical or
      extradimensional.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your body’s physical demise activates the storage crystal, you have the abilities of a psicrystal of the
      appropriate level, plus all the powers you knew and the maximum power points you possessed when
      <i>astral seed</i> was manifested—but you also have a negative level that cannot be healed and that does not
      convert to real level loss in your current crystalline form. You have thirty days to grow an organic body, after
      which time your sentience fades and your soul passes on if it hasn’t entered a new body.
    </p>
    <p>
      To grow a body, you (in the storage crystal) must spend ten days in uninterrupted solitude. The body’s constituent
      parts are pulled as ectoplasm from the Astral Plane, then slowly molded and transformed into a living, breathing
      body that is an exact duplicate of your body at the time you manifested <i>astral seed</i> (the crystal itself
      breaks down and becomes a part of the new organic body). When the tenth day ends, you completely and totally
      inhabit the new body. You possess all the abilities you possessed when <i>astral seed</i> was manifested, at one
      level lower, but you have none of your equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the body is struck for any amount of damage during the ten-day period when it is growing, it is destroyed and
      your soul passes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceivably, you could manifest <i>mind switch</i> to utilize a temporary body, but only an evil creature would
      smash his own temporarily empty storage crystal to permanently usurp a subject’s organic body (unless the subject
      is itself irredeemably evil).

      This power allows you or a creature you touch to participate in an astral caravan created through use of the
      <i>astral caravan</i> power. While participating in a journey allowed by the <i>astral caravan</i> power, you must
      hold the hand of both your fellow passenger ahead of you (or the caravan leader) and your fellow passenger behind
      you (unless you happen to be the last in the hand-linked line). If you or any one of your fellow passengers breaks
      the hand-to-hand link for 2 consecutive rounds, the impetus through the Astral Plane provided by
      <i>astral caravan</i> fails. See the <i>astral caravan</i> power for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      All those who are part of the caravan who are capable of performing purely mental actions, such as manifesting a
      power, may do so while maintaining hand-to-hand contact with their fellow travelers. When astral travelers begin
      their journey, each one is connected to the Material Plane by an insubstantial silvery cord. Very few weapons
      exist that can damage a silvery cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last creature in the line of those making up the caravan is sometimes referred to as the rear guard, because
      he or she has one hand free and can use it to wield a weapon without relinquishing his or her grip on the next
      traveler in line. The weightless, subjective environment of the Astral Plane allows the caravan to flex and bend
      as necessary to bring the rear guard’s weapon to bear.

    <p>
      You plant a compelling attraction in the mind of the subject. The attraction can be toward a particular person or
      an object. The subject will take reasonable steps to meet, get close to, attend, or find the object of its
      implanted attraction. For the purpose of this power, “reasonable” means that, while attracted, the subject doesn’t
      suffer from blind obsession. He will act on this attraction only when not engaged in combat. The subject won’t
      perform obviously suicidal actions. He can still recognize danger but will not flee unless the threat is
      immediate. If you make the subject feel an attraction to yourself, you can’t command him indiscriminately,
      although he will be willing to listen to you (even if he disagrees). This power grants you a +4 bonus on any
      interaction checks you make involving the subject (such as Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive).

    <p>
      You can use this power in one of two ways: to disguise the subject’s aura (alignment) and level, or to remove a
      compulsion or charm effect from the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Disguise:</em> If you use this power to disguise the subject’s alignment and level, the power has a duration
      of 10 minutes per level. You can change the subject’s alignment by only one step. You can adjust the subject’s
      apparent level up or down by a number equal to one-half your own level (rounded down) or less.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Remove Compulsion:</em> If you use this power to attempt to cleanse the subject’s aura of a baleful or
      controlling effect, the duration is instantaneous. This power can remove the compulsion of a curse or a
      <i>geas/quest</i> effect. It can also negate any charm and compulsion powers of 6th level or lower, such as
      <i>crisis of breath</i> or <i>death urge.</i> When <i>aura alteration</i> is manifested for this purpose, the
      subject gains another saving throw to remove the compulsion afflicting it against the original save DC, but with a
      +2 bonus.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.</p>
    <p>1. For every additional power point you spend, the duration of the disguise aura increases by 10 minutes.</p>
    <p>
      2. If you spend 2 additional power points, the subject’s alignment shifts an additional step; if you spend 4
      additional power points, the subject’s alignment changes to its opposite.

    <p>
      You discern auras. Auras are invisible to the naked eye, but to a psionic viewer manifesting this power they
      appear as glowing halos or envelopes of colored light that surround all objects. The color of each aura reveals
      information to the psionic character. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a
      particular area.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>1st Round:</em> Presence of good and evil auras in the area. You can’t pin an aura to a particular object or
      individual at this stage; instead, you see a colored haze suffusing the area. (This power can detect lawful and
      chaotic auras as well, but doing so requires a separate manifestation that focuses only on that alignment axis.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>2nd Round:</em> Number of auras (creatures, objects, powers, or spells) in the area. You know how many auras
      are in the area, even though each aura doesn’t resolve to its actual location quite yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>3rd Round:</em> The owner of each aura is revealed, unless the individual is outside your line of sight. If a
      creature whose aura you detect has 5 or more Hit Dice than you do, you are overwhelmed by its presence and dazed
      for 1 round, and the power ends.

    <p>
      You plant a powerful aversion in the mind of the subject. If the object of the implanted aversion is an individual
      or a physical object, she will prefer not to approach within 30 feet of it. If it is a word, she will try not to
      utter it; if it is an action, she will not willingly attempt to perform it; and if it is an event, she will not
      willingly attend it. The subject will take reasonable steps to avoid the object of its aversion, but will not put
      herself in jeopardy by doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the subject is forced into taking an action she has an aversion to, she takes a –2 penalty on any attack rolls,
      ability checks, or skill checks involved.

    <p>
      <i>Bend reality</i> lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, <i>bend reality</i> can do any of the
      following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Duplicate any psion power of 6th level or lower, provided the power is not of a discipline prohibited to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Duplicate any other power (but not a spell) of 5th level or lower, provided the power is not of a discipline
        prohibited to you.
      </li>
      <li>Duplicate any psion power of 5th level or lower, even if it’s of a prohibited discipline.</li>
      <li>
        Duplicate any other power (but not a spell) of 4th level or lower, even if it’s of a prohibited discipline.
      </li>
      <li>
        Undo the harmful effects of many powers, such as
        <i>psionic dominate, geas/quest,</i> or <i>insanity</i>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature
        automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a –8 penalty on its next saving throw.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A duplicated power allows saving throws and power resistance as normal (but the save DC is for a 8th-level power).
    </p>
    <p>
      When <i>bend reality</i> duplicates a power that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost or 300 XP, whichever is
      more. When <i>bend reality</i> duplicates a spell with a material component, you must pay additional XP equal to
      the value of the material component divided by 5.

      Your posture becomes stooped forward, and you grow a muzzle complete with fangs. You gain one bite attack each
      round, instead of or in addition to any other attacks you have, that deals 1d8 points of damage (assuming you are
      a Medium creature) when it hits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your bite attack is a natural weapon, so you are considered armed when attacking with it, and it can be affected
      by powers, spells, and effects that enhance or improve natural weapons. You can choose to deal nonlethal damage
      with your bite, taking the standard –4 penalty on your attack roll. If you bite as your only attack, you use your
      highest base attack bonus on the attack roll, and you can apply your full Strength bonus to damage. If you bite in
      addition to making other attacks, the bite is a secondary attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are not a Medium creature, your bite attack’s base damage varies as follows: Fine 1d2, Diminutive 1d3, Tiny

      You can adjust your body’s equilibrium to correspond with any solid or liquid that you stand on. Thus, you can
      walk on water, quicksand, or even a spider’s web without sinking or breaking through (this effect does not confer

      You call a weapon “from thin air” into your waiting hand (actually, it is a real weapon hailing from another
      location in space and time). You don’t have to see or know of a weapon to call it—in fact, you can’t call a
      specific weapon; you just specify the kind. If you call a projectile weapon, it comes with 3d6 nonmagical bolts,
      arrows, or sling bullets, as appropriate. The weapon is made of ordinary materials as appropriate for its kind. If
      you relinquish your grip on the weapon you called for 2 or more consecutive rounds, it automatically returns to
      wherever it originated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weapons gained by <i>call weaponry</i> are distinctive due to their astral glimmer. They are considered magic
      weapons and thus are effective against damage reduction that requires a magic weapon to overcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      By manifesting this power, you generate psychic static, interfering with the ability of other psionic characters
      to manifest their powers or use psi-like abilities (you are not affected by your own
      <i>catapsi</i> manifestation). All psionic activity within the area requires 4 more power points to manifest than
      normal, unless a character makes a Will save each time he attempts to manifest a power. Using a psi-like ability
      becomes a full-round action, instead of a standard action, in a <i>catapsi</i> field. If two or more fields of
      <i>catapsi</i> overlap, the effects are not cumulative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The limit on the number of power points a subject can spend on a power remains in effect; thus, a subject may not
      be able to manifest its highest-level powers. If manifesting a power would cause the manifester to exceed his
      available power points or his spending limits, the manifestation fails automatically, but no power points are
      expended.

      enough to gain the benefit of the power while you fall. Manifesting the power is an immediate action, like

      You can see and hear a distant location almost as if you were there. You don’t need line of sight or line of

      corner, or in a grove of trees. Once you have selected the locale, the focus of your
      <i>clairvoyant sense</i> doesn’t move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike

    <p>
      If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect such as
      <i>claws of the beast</i>), you can use this power to energize that weapon. The claw attack deals an extra 1d6
      points of cold, electricity, or fire damage (as chosen by you at the time of manifestation) on a successful hit.
      On a critical hit, it deals an extra 1d10 points of energy damage. If the claw’s critical multiplier is x3, add
      2d10 points of energy damage instead; if the multiplier is x4, add 3d10 points of energy damage.

      This power can be manifested on a claw attack that already deals energy damage, but if the claw already deals the

      benefiting from the effect of the power, the newer manifestation supersedes the older manifestation, even if both
      manifestations are of different energy types.

    <p>
      You call forth the aggressive nature of the beast inherent in yourself, psionically transforming your hands into
      deadly claws. You gain two natural attacks with your claws, each dealing 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if you are
      Large, or 1d3 if you are Small) plus your Strength bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your claws are natural weapons, so you are considered armed when attacking with them, and they can be affected by
      powers, spells, and effects that enhance or improve natural. You can choose to deal nonlethal damage with your
      claws, taking the standard –4 penalty on your attack roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your claws work just like the natural weapons of many monsters. You can make an attack with one claw or a full
      attack with two claws at your normal attack bonus, replacing your normal attack routine. You take no penalties for
      two-weapon fighting, and neither attack is a secondary attack. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do
      not gain any additional attacks—you simply have two claw attacks at your normal attack bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power on your turn
      before you attack. Manifesting this power is a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts
      toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. You cannot manifest this power when it isn’t your turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can call or dismiss the claws as a swift action during the duration of the power. If you attack with a
      manufactured weapon or another natural attack, you can’t make any claw attacks in that round. You can still hold
      and manipulate items with your claws or cast spells just as well as you could with your hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend additional power points, you can create larger, sharper, and more deadly
      claws, as shown on the table below.

      If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect such as
      <i>claws of the beast</i>), you can use this power to change the nature of that weapon. When this power is
      manifested, your claws take on an ominous glimmer. Each time you make a successful claw attack against a living
      creature of Small or larger size, you are healed of some amount of damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      You heal a number of hit points equal to half the base damage dealt by your <i>claws of the vampire,</i> rounded

      higher. Any damage that would reduce the creature to 0 or fewer hit points does not benefit you.

      regeneration ability. Moreover, you gain no healing from attacking any creature that is under the effect of
      <i>biofeedback</i>. Using <i>fission</i> on yourself and then attacking your duplicate also fails to grant any
      healing.

      You make yourself completely undetectable to the subject by erasing all awareness of your presence from its mind.
      This power has the following effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, you are invisible and inaudible to the creature. It cannot even detect your presence by means of
      blindsense, blindsight, scent, or tremorsense. It cannot pinpoint your location by any means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, the subject remains unaware of your actions, provided you do not make any attacks or cause any obvious or
      directly threatening changes in the subject’s environment. If you attack the subject creature, the effect ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you take an action that creates a sustained and obvious change in the subject’s environment—for example,
      attacking a creature aside from the subject or moving a large or attended object the subject can see—the subject
      immediately gains a new saving throw against the power. An ally of the subject creature that is able to see or
      perceive you can use a move action to warn the subject and thereby grant it a new saving throw.

      This power causes instant diminution, halving your height, length, and width and dividing your weight by 8. This
      decrease changes your size category to the next smaller one. You gain a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a –2 size
      penalty to Strength (to a minimum effective Strength score of 1), a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 size
      bonus to Armor Class due to your reduced size. If your new size is Tiny, you have a space of 2 1/2 feet and a
      natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that you must enter an opponent’s square to attack). If your new size is
      Diminutive, you have a space of 1 foot and a natural reach of 0 feet. This power doesn’t change your speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All your equipment, worn or carried, is similarly reduced by the power. Melee and projectile weapons deal less
      damage. Other psionic or magical properties are not affected by this power. Any affected item that leaves your
      possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown
      weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them).
      Multiple effects that reduce size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can’t use a second
      manifestation of this power to further reduce yourself.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.</p>
    <p>
      1. If you spend 6 additional power points, this power decreases your size by two size categories. You gain a +4
      size bonus to Dexterity, a –4 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum effective Strength score of 1), a +2 size
      bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 size bonus to Armor Class due to your reduced size.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. If you spend 6 additional power points, you can manifest this power as a swift action instead of a standard
      action.
    </p>

      3. If you spend 2 additional power points, this power’s duration is 1 minute per level rather than 1 round per

      You can place another power upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when
      manifesting
      <i>psionic contingency</i>. The <i>psionic contingency</i> power and the companion power are manifest at the same

      manifesting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. The power to be brought into effect by the

      You psychokinetically control the actions of any humanoid (including undead or outsiders with a humanoid
      physiology) that is within range and to which you have line of sight. <i>Control body</i> doesn’t require mental
      contact with the subject, since you are actually forcing limb movements independent of the target’s mind. You can
      force the subject to stand up, sit down, walk, turn around, and so on, but operating the vocal cords is too
      difficult. You can also hold the subject immobile, rendering it helpless. You cannot force the subject to manifest
      powers, cast spells, or use any special ability that is not a function of just its body movements. If you lose
      line of sight to the subject, the effect of this power ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you force the subject to engage in combat, its attack bonus is equal to your base attack bonus + your
      Intelligence bonus, and its bonus on damage rolls is equal to your Intelligence bonus. A subject of this power
      cannot make attacks of opportunity. The subject gains no benefit to Armor Class from its Dexterity, but it does
      gain a bonus to its AC equal to your Intelligence bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the subject’s body is under your control, the subject’s mind is not. Creatures capable of taking purely
      mental actions (such as manifesting powers) can do so.

    <p>
      <strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power can affect a target one size
      category larger.

      <li><strong>Power Points:</strong> 1</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You pyrokinetically control the intensity or movements of one fire source. A nonmagical fire source can be
      controlled if it is equal to or smaller than the maximum size of fire you can control according to your manifester
      level, as noted on the accompanying table. You can freely switch control between fire sources, or change the
      nature of your control, while you maintain concentration, but only one specified change (keeping a fire burning,
      animating it, or altering its size) can be made to one fire source in a round. When your control over a fire
      source lapses, that fire immediately returns to its original state (or goes out if it has no fuel or has been
      moved away from its original location). With this power, you can artificially keep a fire burning that would
      normally expire for lack of fuel; even dousing a controlled flame with water does not put it out (though
      completely submerging the flame would). Normally, a creature at risk of catching on fire can avoid this fate by
      making a DC 15 Reflex saving throw, with success indicating that the fire has gone out. If the fire is one that
      has been kept burning by the use of
      <i>control flames,</i> then the DC of the Reflex save needed to put out the flames increases to 25.
    </p>
    <p>
      This power also enables you to make a fire move as if it were a living creature. You can animate only a naturally
      burning fire; if you attempt to animate one that has been increased or decreased in size by your augmentation of
      this power, the fire immediately returns to its original size. An animated fire moves at a speed of 30 feet. A
      fire that moves away from its fuel or its original location dies as soon as your control over it lapses.
    </p>
    <p>
      An animated fire can enter any square, even if a creature already occupies it. If an animated fire enters a square
      occupied by a creature, that creature can make a Reflex save to get out of the way (DC 11 + the number of dice of
      damage the fire does + your Int modifier if you are a psion or your Cha modifier if you are a wilder). A
      successful Reflex save moves the creature to the nearest unoccupied square. The flames deal the indicated damage
      to any creature that is either on fire or surrounded by the flames (in the fire’s space); see the accompanying
      table).
    </p>
    <p>
      At the start of your turn, the animated fire deals damage to any creature in its space, and the creature catches
      on fire unless it makes a Reflex save (DC as noted above). A victim on fire takes 1d6 points of damage each round.
      Additional rounds in the same space as the animated fire occupies mean additional chances of ignition. The damage
      from multiple normal fires stacks, but the victim gets a saving throw each round to negate each fire. It is
      possible to switch control from the animated fire (causing it to disappear) to intensify f lames that are already
      burning (thus denying the foe Ref lex saves after the first).

      light to see declines accordingly.If you decrease the ambient light in an area by 100%, even those with lowlight
      vision are unable to see within the affected area. For each 25% decrease in ambient light, characters in the area
      gain a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus on Hide checks (to a maximum of +4 when all the light is gone).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Increase:</em> You can increase the illumination of an area by as little as 5% (barely perceptible) or as much

      improves accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this power to increase the illumination of an area by 200% (improving visual abilities accordingly),
      but in such a case the power’s duration is only 1 round.

      You telekinetically “bring to life” an inanimate object. Though it is not actually alive, the object moves under
      your control. Live vegetation cannot be controlled in this fashion, nor can already animated objects or undead.
      The controlled object moves like a puppet, with jerky and clumsy movements, at a speed of up to 20 feet. If its
      form is rigid, it makes creaking, groaning, or grating sounds as you control it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A controlled object can attack an opponent if you direct it to do so. It has one slam attack, at a base attack
      bonus equal to your base attack bonus plus your Intelligence modifier. If the attack hits, it deals points of
      damage equal to 1d6 plus your Intelligence modifier. A controlled object has its usual hardness and hit points.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this power on a nonmagical lock, making it move in such a way as to attempt to unlock itself. If
      another character makes an Open Lock check involving a lock that you are concentrating on controlling, the
      character gains a +4 bonus on the check.

      You shape and alter existing sounds. You can target one sound, such as a person speaking or singing, or a group of
      related sounds, such as the patter of many raindrops or the tramp of soldiers passing by. A sound as quiet as a
      snapping finger can be controlled. You can substitute any sound you have heard for the target sound. If you
      attempt to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual, or an inherently terrifying sound (such as a
      dragon’s roar), you must succeed on a Bluff check with a +5 circumstance bonus opposed by the intended listener’s
      Sense Motive check to avoid arousing suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can entirely muffle a noise or magnify a sound to such loudness that it drowns out all other conversation in
      the immediate area. In this way, you can provide yourself or any with a +4 circumstance bonus on Move Silently and
      Listen checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can use up the power in an instant. You do this by modulating a sound into a one-time
      destructive impetus that shatters nonmagical/nonpsionic, unattended objects of crystal, glass, ceramics, or
      porcelain (vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, mirrors, and so forth) in the area.

      You take over control of a power that was manifested by the subject and that must be maintained through
      concentration. Once you wrest control of the power from the subject, you have several options.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow the power to function as normal.</li>
      <li>
        Keep the power targeted on the subject (if a personal power) but decide how the power fulfills its function each

      You forge a passive mental link with a creature with which you have previously had physical or mental contact. The
      subject need not be within sight or even on the same plane as you are. The subject recognizes you, and you can
      mentally communicate with it for the duration (though nothing forces the subject to respond to you), exchanging
      messages of twenty-five words or less once per round. Receiving a message is not an action and does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity; however, sending a message is equivalent to a standard action that can provoke attacks of
      opportunity.

    <p>
      You create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of
      sound the power creates when manifesting it and cannot thereafter change its basic character. The volume of sound
      created, however, depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per manifester level
      (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created.
      The noise produced can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and
      squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from
      sixteen humans, while a roaring dire lion is equal to the noise from twenty humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to create a specific message, up to twenty-five words can be created, and those words repeat over and
      over until the duration expires or the power is dismissed. If you attempt to exactly duplicate the voice of a
      specific individual or an inherently terrifying sound (such as a dragon’s roar), you must succeed on a Bluff check
      with a +2 circumstance bonus opposed by the listener’s Sense Motive check to avoid arousing suspicion.

    <p>
      You compel the subject to purge its entire store of air in one explosive exhalation, and thereby disrupt the
      subject’s autonomic breathing cycle. The subject’s lungs do not automatically function again while the power’s
      duration lasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the target succeeds on a Will save when <i>crisis of breath</i> is manifested, it is unaffected by this power.
      If it fails its Will save, it can still continue to breathe by taking a standard action in each round to gasp for
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      An affected creature can attempt to take actions normally (instead of consciously controlling its breathing), but
      each round it does so, beginning in the round when it failed its Will save, the subject risks blacking out from
      lack of oxygen. It must succeed on a Fortitude save at the end of any of its turns in which it did not consciously
      take a breath. The DC of this save increases by 1 in every consecutive round after the first one that goes by
      without a breath; the DC drops back to its original value if the subject spends an action to take a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a subject fails a Fortitude save, it is disabled (0 hp). In the following round, it drops to –1 hit points and
      is dying. Curing powers or spells can revive a dying subject normally, so long as this power’s duration has
      expired; if the power is still in effect, a revived creature is still subject to Fortitude saves in each round
      when it does not consciously breathe.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.</p>
    <p>
      1. If you spend 2 additional power points, this power can also affect an animal, fey, giant, magical beast, or
      monstrous humanoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. If you spend 4 additional power points, this power can also affect an aberration, dragon, elemental, or
      outsider in addition to the creature types mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. If you spend 6 additional power points, this power can affect up to four creatures all within a 20-ft.-radius
      burst.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, for every 2 additional power points you spend to achieve any of these effects, this power’s save DC
      increases by 1.

      You seed the subject’s flesh with supersaturated crystal. In an eyeblink, the subject’s form seems to freeze over,
      as its flesh and fluids are instantly crystallized. Following the application of this power, the subject appears
      lifeless. In fact, it is not dead (though no life can be detected with powers or spells that detect such).

    <p>
      This power has a chance of being dispelled only by a manifester of a higher level than you when you manifested
      this power. When the power is dispelled, crystal melts back into flesh, and the subject is in exactly the state he
      was prior being affected by <i>crystallize.</i>
