    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--autohypnosiswis-trained-only--check--ignore-caltrop-wound">Ignore Caltrop Wound:</em>
      If you are wounded by stepping on a caltrop, your speed is reduced to one-half normal. A successful Autohypnosis
      check removes this movement penalty. The wound doesn’t go away—it is just ignored through self-persuasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--autohypnosiswis-trained-only--check--memorize">Memorize:</em> You can attempt to
      memorize a long string of numbers, a long passage of verse, or some other particularly difficult piece of
      information (but you can’t memorize magical writing or similarly exotic scripts). Each successful check allows you
      to memorize a single page of text (up to 800 words), numbers, diagrams, or sigils (even if you don’t recognize
      their meaning). If a document is longer than one page, you can make additional checks for each additional page.
      You always retain this information; however, you can recall it only with another successful Autohypnosis check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--autohypnosiswis-trained-only--check--resist-dying">Resist Dying:</em> You can attempt
      to subconsciously prevent yourself from dying. If you have negative hit points and are losing hit points (at 1 per
      round, 1 per hour), you can substitute a DC 15 Autohypnosis check for your d% roll to see if you become stable. If
      the check is successful, you stop losing hit points (you do not gain any hit points, however, as a result of the
      check). You can substitute this check for the d% roll in later rounds if you are initially unsuccessful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--autohypnosiswis-trained-only--check--resist-fear">Resist Fear:</em> In response to any
      fear effect, you make a saving throw normally. If you fail the saving throw, you can make an Autohypnosis check on
      your next round even while overcome by fear. If your autohypnosis check meets or beats the DC for the fear effect,
      you shrug off the fear. On a failed check, the fear affects you normally, and you gain no further attempts to
      shrug off that particular fear effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--autohypnosiswis-trained-only--check--tolerate-poison">Tolerate Poison:</em> You can
      choose to substitute an Autohypnosis check for a saving throw against any standard poison’s secondary damage or
      effect. This skill has no effect on the initial saving throw against poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--autohypnosiswis-trained-only--check--willpower">Willpower:</em> If reduced to 0 hit
      points (disabled), you can make an Autohypnosis check. If successful, you can take a normal action while at 0 hit
      points without taking 1 point of damage. You must make a check for each strenuous action you want to take. A
      failed Autohypnosis check in this circumstance carries no direct penalty—you can choose not to take the strenuous
      action and thus avoid the hit point loss. If you do so anyway, you drop to –1 hit points, as normal when disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--autohypnosiswis-trained-only--action">Action:</strong> None. Making an
      Autohypnosis check doesn’t require an action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of
      another action (when attempted actively).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--autohypnosiswis-trained-only--try-again">Try Again:</strong> Yes, for memorize and
      willpower uses, though a success doesn’t cancel the effects of a previous failure. No for the other uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--autohypnosiswis-trained-only--synergy">Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more
      ranks in Autohypnosis, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (psionics) checks.
    </p>
    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Concentration, you get a +2 bonus on Autohypnosis checks.</p>
    <h3 id="skill-descriptions--concentrationcon">Concentration<small>(Con)</small></h3>
    <p>You are particularly good at focusing your mind.</p>
    <p>The following are additional uses for the concentration skill.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--concentrationcon--check">Check:</strong> You must make a Concentration check
      whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some
      action that requires your full attention. Such actions include manifesting a power, concentrating on an active
      power, directing a power, or using a psi-like ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Concentration check succeeds, you can continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action
      automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of manifesting a power, the power points are lost.
      If you were concentrating on an active power, the power ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were
      directing a power, the direction fails but the power remains active. If you were using a psi-like ability, that
      use of the ability is lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check. If the
      distraction occurs while you are trying to manifest a power, you must add the level of the power you are trying to
      manifest to the appropriate Concentration DC.

    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--concentrationcon--check--gain-psionic-focus">Gain Psionic Focus:</em> Merely holding a
      reservoir of psionic power points in mind gives psionic characters a special energy. Psionic characters can put
      that energy to work without actually paying a power point cost—they can become psionically focused as a special
      use of the Concentration skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have 1 or more power points available, you can meditate to attempt to become psionically focused. The DC to
      become psionically focused is 20. Meditating is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. When you
      are psionically focused, you can expend your focus on any single Concentration check you make thereafter. When you
      expend your focus in this manner, your Concentration check is treated as if you rolled a 15. It’s like taking 10,
      except that the number you add to your Concentration modifier is 15. You can also expend your focus to gain the
      benefit of a psionic feat—many psionic feats are activated in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you are psionically focused, you remain focused until you expend your focus, become unconscious, or go to
      sleep (or enter a meditative trance, in the case of elans), or until your power point reserve drops to 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--concentrationcon--action">Action:</strong> Usually none. In most cases, making a
      Concentration check doesn’t require an action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of
      another action (when attempted actively). Meditating to gain psionic focus is a full-round action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--concentrationcon--try-again">Try Again:</strong> Yes, though a success doesn’t
      cancel the effects of a previous failure, such as the loss of the power points for a power being manifested or the
      disruption of a power being concentrated on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--concentrationcon--special">Special:</strong> You can use Concentration to manifest
      a power or use a psi-like ability defensively, so as to avoid attacks of opportunity altogether. The DC of the
      check is 15 + the power’s level. If the Concentration check succeeds, you can manifest normally without provoking
      any attacks of opportunity. If the Concentration check fails, the power also automatically fails and the power
      points are wasted, just as if your concentration had been disrupted by a distraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character with the Combat Manifestation feat gets a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to manifest a power or
      use a psi-like ability while on the defensive or while grappling or pinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--concentrationcon--synergy">Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in

    <p>
      Like the Craft and Profession skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of unrelated skills. This entry
      specifically relates to the body of lore dealing with the phenomena of psionics in all its many manifestations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowledge (psionics) covers ancient mysteries, psionic traditions, psychic symbols, cryptic phrases, astral
      constructs, and psionic races. You can use this skill to identify psionic monsters and their special powers or
      vulnerabilities.

      special +2 bonus if you’ve activated the item at least once before.

      If you fail the check by 10 or more, you suffer brainburn. This brainburn affects you in the same way as brainburn
      that can occur when you attempt to manifest a power from a power stone, except that the damage is 1d4 points per
      power level instead of 1d6. Brainburn damage from activating blindly is in addition to brainburn damage from
      manifesting a power from a power stone.

        >Address a Power Stone:</em
      >
      Successfully addressing a power stone allows you to find out what power or powers it contains. Doing this requires
      1 minute of concentration.

      <em id="skill-descriptions--use-psionic-device-cha-trained-only--check--emulate-an-ability-score"
        >Emulate an Ability Score:</em
      >
      To manifest a power from a power stone, you need a high ability score in the appropriate ability. Your effective
      ability score (appropriate to the class you’re emulating when you try to manifest the power from the power stone)
      is your check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don’t need
      to make this check.

      <em id="skill-descriptions--use-psionic-device-cha-trained-only--check--emulate-an-alignment"
        >Emulate an Alignment:</em
      >
      Some psionic items have positive or negative effects based on your alignment. Use Psionic Device lets you use
      these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.

      <em id="skill-descriptions--use-psionic-device-cha-trained-only--check--emulate-a-class-feature"
        >Emulate a Class Feature:</em
      >
      Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a psionic item. Your effective level in the emulated class
      equals your check result minus 20. This skill does not let you use the class feature of another class. It just
      lets you activate items as if you had the class feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by
      emulating an appropriate alignment as a separate check (see above).

      <em id="skill-descriptions--use-psionic-device-cha-trained-only--check--use-a-dorje">Use a Dorje:</em> Normally,
      to use a dorje, you must have the dorje’s power on your class power list. This use of the skill allows you to use
      a dorje as if you had a particular power on your class power list. This use of the skill applies to other power
      trigger psionic items, if applicable.

      <em id="skill-descriptions--use-psionic-device-cha-trained-only--check--use-a-power-stone">Use a Power Stone:</em>
      Normally, to manifest a power from a power stone, you must have the power stone’s power on your class power list.
      This use of the skill allows you to use a power stone as if you had a particular power on your class power list.
      The DC is equal to 20 + the manifester level of the power you are trying to manifest from the power stone.
      <i>Note:</i> Before you use
    </p>
    <p>
      a power stone, you must first have addressed it to determine what powers it contains. In addition, manifesting a
      power from a power stone requires a minimum score (10 + power level) in the appropriate ability. If you don’t have
      a high enough score, you must emulate the ability score with a separate check (see above). This use of the skill
      applies to other power completion psionic items.
