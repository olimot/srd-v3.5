      You can sense the presence of danger before your senses would normally allow it. Your intuitive sense alerts you
      to danger from traps, giving you a +4 insight bonus on Ref lex saves to avoid traps and a +4 insight bonus to
      Armor Class against attacks by traps.

    </ul>

    <p>
      You plant a hidden death-urge impulse in the subject’s unconscious. On the subject’s next turn, it looks for the
      quickest method to end its life and attempts to do so. The subject takes no other action on its turn except
      attempting to harm itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If armed, the subject attacks itself as a full-round action. The attack automatically succeeds and deals damage as
      a critical hit. If unarmed, the subject moves adjacent to the nearest enemy and provokes an attack of opportunity,
      offering its opponent an opening, which the opponent may or may not choose to take advantage of.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the subject is unarmed and no enemy is nearby, the subject simply does nothing at all. A subject close to an
      immediate and lethal hazard such as a cliff or a fire might hurl itself off the cliff or into the fire instead of
      striking itself with a weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="death-urge--augment">Augment:</strong> For every 4 additional power points you spend, this power’s
      save DC increases by 2 and its duration increases by 1 round.

    <h2 id="deceleration">Deceleration</h2>

      <li><strong id="deceleration--power-points">Power Points:</strong> 1</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You warp space around an individual, hindering the subject’s ability to move. The subject’s speed (in any movement
      mode it possesses) is halved. A subsequent manifestation of <i>deceleration</i> on the subject does not further
      decrease its speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="deceleration--augment">Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power can
      affect a target one size category larger.

    <h2 id="decerebrate">Decerebrate</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
      <li>Psychoportation [Teleportation]</li>

      <li><strong id="decerebrate--power-points">Power Points:</strong> 13</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With <i>decerebrate,</i> you selectively remove a portion of the subject’s brain stem. The creature loses all
      cerebral function, vision, hearing, and other sensory abilities, and all voluntary motor activity. The subject
      becomes limp and unresponsive. Without extreme measures, such as <i>greater restoration</i> or some other suitable
      effect of 7th level or higher, the creature perishes in 1d4 days.
    </p>
    <h2 id="dj-vu">DÉJà Vu</h2>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-inline-start: 0px">

      <li><strong id="dj-vu--power-points">Power Points:</strong> 1</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Your mental impulse forces the subject to repeat the actions it took on its previous turn. If the situation has
      changed in such a way that the subject can’t take the same actions again (if its foe is dead, or the subject has
      run out of power points, and so on), the subject stands still and takes no actions for 1 round. In any event, the
      subject can still defend itself, and it retains its Dexterity bonus to AC even if it stands still.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="dj-vu--augment">Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s save DC

      <li><strong id="demoralize--power-points">Power Points:</strong> 1</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You fill your enemies with self-doubt. Any enemy in the area that fails its save becomes shaken for the duration
      of the power. Allies and creatures without an Intelligence score are unaffected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="demoralize--augment">Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s

    <p>
      Your mere touch grants your foe an imperfect, unfocused glimpse of the many possible futures in store.
      Unaccustomed to and unable to process the information, the subject becomes sickened for 1 round per level of the
      manifester.

    </ul>

    <p>
      While the duration of this power lasts, you become aware of the presence of any creatures with hostile intent
      within 30 feet of you, and their direction from you (but not their specific location). The power detects active
      aggression, as opposed to vigilance. In addition, while this power is active you cannot be surprised or caught
      flatfooted by creatures that are susceptible to mind-affecting powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      While under the effect of this power, you can make Sense Motive checks as a free action against anyone within 30
      feet of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of stone, 3 inches of common metal, 1 inch of lead, or 6 feet of wood
      or dirt blocks it.

    <p>
      You detect psionic auras. A psionic aura is given off by any active or permanent power, or during the use of any
      psionic feat. Characters who have levels in a psionic class, creatures with the psionic subtype, and creatures
      with the Wild Talent feat possess psionic auras. The amount of information revealed by the manifestation of this
      power depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

      feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

      You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of a clairsentience (scrying) power or
      divination (scrying) spell. The power’s effect radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the location of
      every psionic or magical sensor within the power’s area.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the viewing attempt originates within the area, you also know the viewer’s location. Otherwise, you and the
      remote viewer immediately make opposed manifester level checks (1d20 + manifester level, or viewer’s caster level
      as appropriate). If you at least match the remote viewer’s result, you get a visual image of the remote viewer and
      an accurate sense of the remote viewer’s direction and distance from you.

      You broadcast a mental compulsion that convinces one or more creatures of 4 Hit Dice or less that they are
      disabled (see page 307 of the
      <i>Player’s Handbook</i>). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal Hit Dice,
      those who are closest to the power’s point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to
      affect a creature are wasted. Creatures that are rendered helpless or are destroyed when they reach 0 hit points
      cannot be affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures affected by this power believe that they have somehow been brought to the brink of unconsciousness and
      must act accordingly. While it’s possible for an important nonplayer character to attempt some sort of “heroic”
      action, common NPCs and creatures under the effect of this power typically cower or retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any creature that attempts to take a standard action immediately breaks the compulsion and can act normally. A
      creature that attempts to heal itself or that receives healing is likewise freed of the compulsion, and if it is
      not actually wounded, the healing is wasted. A creature that takes damage is also instantly freed of the
      compulsion (although the damage still counts against its actual current hit points).

      You can use <i>dispel psionics</i> to end ongoing powers that have been manifested on a creature or object, to
      temporarily suppress the psionic abilities of a psionic item, or to end ongoing powers (or at least their effects)
      within an area. A dispelled power ends as if its duration had expired. Some powers, as detailed in their
      descriptions, can’t be defeated by <i>dispel psionics,</i> or can be ended only if you manifest
      <i>dispel psionics</i> at a high enough manifester level. <i>Dispel psionics</i> can end spell-like effects just
      as it does powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of a power with an instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because the psionic effect is already
      over before the
      <i>dispel psionics</i> can take effect.
    </p>
    <p>You choose to use <i>dispel psionics</i> in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or an area dispel.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="dispel-psionics--power-points--targeted-dispel">Targeted Dispel:</em> One object, creature, or power is
      the target of the <i>dispel psionics</i> power. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your manifester level, maximum
      +10) against the power or against each ongoing power currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for
      this dispel check is 11 + the power’s manifester level. If you succeed on a particular check, that power is
      dispelled; if you fail, that power remains in effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power or is under the effect of an ongoing
      power, you make a dispel check to end the power or its effect. If the object that you target is a psionic item,
      you make a dispel check against the item’s manifester level. If you succeed, all the item’s psionic properties are
      suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the
      duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface is temporarily closed. A psionic item’s physical properties
      are unchanged: A suppressed psionic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities
      are unaffected by mortal power such as this.
    </p>
    <p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any power that you manifested yourself.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="dispel-psionics--power-points--area-dispel">Area Dispel:</em> When <i>dispel psionics</i> is used in this
      way, the power affects everything within a 20-foot radius. For each creature within the area that is the subject
      of one or more powers, you make a dispel check against the power with the highest manifester level. If that check
      fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker powers until you dispel one power (which discharges the
      <i>dispel psionics</i> power so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature’s
      psionic items are not affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each object within the area that is the target of one or more powers, you make dispel checks as with
      creatures. Psionic items are not affected by an area dispel.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each ongoing area or effect power whose point of origin is within the area of the
      <i>dispel psionics</i> power, you can make a dispel check to dispel the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each ongoing power whose area overlaps that of the
      <i>dispel psionics</i> power, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end
      the power that created that object or construct in addition to attempting to dispel powers targeting the creature
      or object. You can choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any power that you have manifested.

      You and any creature you touch are drawn along a crystal arc of reverie to the edge of conscious thought and into
      the region of dreams. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but each
      one must be touching another one. You physically enter the land of dreams, leaving nothing behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the region of dreams, you move through a menagerie of thoughts, desires, and phantoms created by the minds of
      dreamers everywhere. For every minute you move through dream, you can “wake” to find yourself five miles displaced
      in the waking world. Thus, a character can use this power to travel rapidly by physically entering where only
      dreams normally prowl, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back into the waking world. You know where
      you will come out in the waking world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dream travel</i> can also be used to travel to other planes that contain creatures that dream, but doing this
      requires crossing into the dreams of outsiders, where you are subject to the vagaries of many dream realities—a
      potentially perilous proposition. Transferring to another plane of existence in this fashion requires 1d4 hours of
      uninterrupted travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any creatures that come along when <i>dream travel</i> is manifested also make the transition to the borders of
      unconscious thought. A creature separated from you wanders off into the dreamscape. When the duration ends, all
      affected creatures return to the waking world as much as 1,000 miles (d%x10) from their starting point. If a
      creature remains in the dreamscape, it is powerless to leave unless it can manifest the <i>dream travel</i> power
      itself or someone who manifests the power seeks out the lost creature.

      If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect such as
      <i>claws of the beast</i>), you can use this power to improve that weapon. One of your claws becomes
      two-dimensional, making it razorsharp. The weapon is now psionically keen, increasing its threat range from 20 to
      19–20. This benefit does not stack with other effects that improve a weapon’s threat range.
    </p>

    <p>
      You fashion an ephemeral, manylegged mass of pseudo-living ectoplasm called an ectoplasmic shambler. You can
      direct the shambler as a free action. It has a speed of 10 feet. It can completely surround objects (and
      opponents) over which it is manifested or onto which it moves, because it has the consistency of thick mist. The
      vision of those within the shambler is limited to 5 feet, and manifesting powers (or casting spells) within the
      shambler is difficult due to the constant turbulence felt by those caught in the shambler’s form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures enveloped by the shambler, regardless of Armor Class, take 1 point of damage for every two manifester
      levels you have in each round they become or remain within the roiling turbulence of the shambler. Anyone trying
      to manifest a power must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + power’s or spell’s level) to successfully manifest a
      power or cast a spell inside the shambler.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wind stronger than 20 miles per hour that blows against the shambler reduces its speed to 0 feet during the
      first round, and in subsequent rounds moves it in the direction of the wind at a speed of 5 feet. A wind stronger
      than 20 miles per hour that blows in the direction the shambler travels increases its speed to 15 feet.

      You heal another creature’s wounds, transferring some of its damage to yourself. When you manifest this power, you
      can heal as much as 2d10 points of damage. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the dice result, and
      you lose hit points equal to half of that amount. (This loss can bring you to 0 or fewer hit points.) Powers and
      abilities you may have such as damage reduction and regeneration do not lessen or change this damage, since you
      are taking the target’s pain into yourself in an empathic manner. The damage transferred by this power has no
      type, so even if you have immunity to the type of damage the target originally took, the transfer occurs normally
      and deals hit point damage to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can use this power to absorb one poison or one disease afflicting the target creature into
      yourself. When you absorb a poison or disease, you do not take any of the damage previously dealt to the target by
      the affliction, but you do assume the burden of making the secondary and/or continuing Fortitude saves to combat
      the affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, you can use this power to transfer up to 1 point of ability damage per manifester level from the target

      As <i>energy adaptation</i>, except that instead of radiating away energy as light, you store up the energy and
      can later discharge it as a ray. To discharge a ray requires a standard action. You can choose to fire any number
      of rays during the power’s duration. The ray you fire must be of one of the energy types you have stored (if you
      have stored more than one type, you can choose what kind of energy to use for each ray). If a ray successfully
      strikes its target (requiring a ranged touch attack), the target takes damage equal to the amount of energy damage
      of that type you have stored, up to a maximum of three times your manifester level. As long as this power remains
      in effect, you can continue to absorb energy damage and fire additional rays using the stored damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This power’s subtype is the same as the type of energy you discharge in a ray; thus, its subtype can change during
      the course of the power’s duration.

      Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Your body’s psionically fueled
      bioenergetic currents produce an arc of energy of the chosen type that targets a creature you designate as the
      primary foe for 9d6 points of damage in every round when the power remains in effect. Energy also arcs off the
      primary foe to strike one additional foe that is initially within 15 feet of the primary foe, or that subsequently
      moves within 15 feet of the primary foe while the duration lasts. Secondary foes take half the damage that the
      primary foe takes in every round while the duration lasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should either the primary or secondary foe fall to less than 0 hit points (or should a target completely evade the
      effect with a special ability or power), the <i>energy current</i> ’s arc randomly retargets another primary
      and/or secondary foe while the duration lasts. Targeted foes can move normally, possibly moving out of range of
      the effect, but each round they are targeted and remain in range they must make a saving throw to avoid taking
      full damage in that round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concentrating to maintain <i>energy current</i> is a full-round action. If you take damage while maintaining
      <i>energy current</i>, you must make a successful Concentration check (DC 10 + damage dealt) to avoid losing your
      concentration on the power.

      beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. In addition, anyone passing though the <i>energy wall</i> takes 2d6 points of
      damage +1 point per manifester level (maximum +20).

      on a successful save, you instead take no damage.

      You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly come

    <p>
      This power causes instant growth, doubling your height, length, and width and multiplying your weight by 8. This
      increase changes your size category to the next larger one. You gain a +2 size bonus to Strength, a –2 size
      penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum effective Dexterity score of 1), a –1 size penalty on attack rolls, and a –1
      size penalty to Armor Class due to your increased size.

    <p>
      If your new size is Large or larger, you have a space of at least 10 feet and a natural reach of at least 10 feet.
      This power doesn’t change your speed. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the
      maximum possible size and can make a Strength check (using your increased Strength score) to burst any enclosures
      in the process. If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you—you cannot crush
      yourself to death by increasing your size.
    </p>
    <p>
      All your equipment, worn or carried, is similarly expanded by this power. Melee and projectile weapons deal more
      damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other psionic or magical properties are not affected by this power. Any affected item that leaves your possession
      (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons
      deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them). Multiple
      effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can’t use a second
      manifestation of this power to further expand yourself.

      You have a limited ability to falsify one of the subject’s senses. The subject thinks she sees, hears, smells,
      tastes, or feels something other than what her senses actually report. You can’t create a sensation where none
      exists, nor make the subject completely oblivious to a sensation, but you can replace the specifics of one
      sensation with different specifics. For instance, you could make a human look like a dwarf (or one human look like
      another specific human), a closed door look like it is open, a vat of acid smell like rose water, a parrot look
      like a bookend, stale rations taste like fresh fruit, a light pat feel like a dagger thrust, a scream sound like
      the howling wind, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can switch between senses you falsify round by round. You can’t alter the size of an object by more than 50%
      by using this power. Thus, you couldn’t make a castle look like a hovel, but you could make it look like a
      different castle, or a rough hillock of approximately the same size. If this power is used to distract an enemy
      manifester who is attempting to use his powers, the enemy must make a Concentration check as if being grappling or
      pinned.
    </p>

      Because you override a victim’s senses, you can fool a victim who is using

    <p>
      You can use another’s psionic or metapsionic feats for yourself. You make a melee touch attack against a target.
      If successful, you immediately are familiar with the target’s psionic and metapsionic feats, if any, and you can
      choose a number of these feats to “leech” equal to your Wisdom modi- fier (minimum one).
    </p>
    <p>
      While the power lasts, you are treated as if you possessed the stolen feats, despite the fact that you have more
      feats than normally allowed. During this same period, the target can make no use of the stolen feats. When the
      power’s duration expires, you lose access to the feats, and the target gains immediate use of them. This transfer
      occurs regardless of the distance between you and the target.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the duration of <i>feat leech</i> is extended by the use of a metapsionic feat, the target gains a Will saving
      throw every 10 minutes beyond the normal duration. If this save succeeds, the power’s duration ends. If the target
      is killed before the duration expires, you immediately lose the benefit of the stolen feats.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot steal a feat for which you do not meet the prerequisites, if any. However, you can use a stolen feat as
      the prerequisite for another stolen feat.

      You use your mastery of energy to cheat death. If you are within 30 feet of an open flame, you can use this power.
      Any damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points or lower instead has a chance to discorporate you. You attempt a
      Will save (DC 5 + damage dealt); if it succeeds, you simply break apart into dozens of flitting tongues of flame
      and vanish, along with all your gear and anything you are holding or carrying.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day later, you reappear adjacent to an open flame nearest to the place where you discorporated, seeming to
      materialize from the fire (you choose where you appear along the perimeter of that open flame). While
      discorporated, you do not exist—you can do nothing, nor can any of your enemies do anything to you.

    <p>
      You can divide yourself, creating a duplicate that comes into existence 5 feet away. Your duplicate thinks and
      acts exactly as you do and follows your orders, although it will not do anything you wouldn’t do yourself. Your
      duplicate has all your abilities but none of your psionic or magical equipment (it does possess a duplicate of all
      your mundane equipment, clothing, armor, and implements, as well as mundane versions of any psionic or magical
      equipment you have). You and your duplicate evenly split your power points, your remaining usages of pertinent
      special abilities for the day, and so on. You retain your psionic focus, if you maintain such when this power is
      manifested. Treat your duplicate as yourself with two negative levels for the purpose of determining the powers to
      which the duplicate has access (while the duration of this power lasts, those negative levels cannot be removed by
      any means). Your duplicate has all other physical traits you had at the time you manifest this power. Powers,
      spells, or other effects affecting you when you manifest this power do not transfer to your duplicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the duration expires or when you dismiss the power, you and your duplicate rejoin, no matter how far from
      each other you are. You gain back any power points the duplicate has not spent. At the time of rejoining, you take
      half of the damage your duplicate has taken since this power was manifested. This damage could potentially leave
      you with negative hit points, but it can’t reduce your hit points to less than –9.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your duplicate dies before the duration expires, no rejoining occurs, and you gain one negative level. If you
      die, your duplicate remains in existence, and is for all intents you, but with two negative levels. (Once the
      duration expires, one of the negative levels immediately converts to one lost level; the other negative level can
      be removed by standard means.)
    </p>
    <p>
      You can have only one <i>fissioned</i> duplicate in existence at one time; your duplicate cannot use this power.
      You cannot use <i>fusion</i> or <i>metaconcert</i> with a duplicate, or share any other power or effect that pools
      abilities (the sum of you and you is still just you). Similarly, attempting to use powers such as
      <i>claws of the vampire</i> or <i>vampiric blade</i> to hurt your duplicate only damages your duplicate; these
      powers do not heal you. <i>Empathic transfer</i> and similar powers are likewise ineffective (transferring wounds
      to yourself isn’t a good healing strategy).
    </p>
    <p>
      All powers affecting a <i>fissioned</i> creature, either the original or the duplicate, end when the
      <i>fission</i> ends. All damage, including hit point damage, ability damage, ability drain, and ability burn
      damage, is added together.

      effect.

      Your horrific form grants you a natural armor bonus of +5, damage reduction 5/–, and a +4 bonus to your Strength

      A nest of violently flailing black tentacles sprout from your hair and back. You can make up to four additional

      action. You can make tentacle attacks within the space you normally threaten. If you make your tentacle attacks in
      addition to you regular melee attacks, each tentacle attacks at your highest base attack bonus with a –5 penalty.
      If you forgo all your other attacks, making only tentacle attacks, you make your tentacle attacks at your highest

      You cause the touched subject’s flesh to ripple, grow together, and fuse into a nearly seamless whole. The subject
      is forced into a fetal position (if humanoid), with only the vaguest outline of its folded arms and legs visible
      below the all-encompassing wave of flesh. The subject retains the ability to breathe, eat, and excrete, but may
      lose the use of its senses (see below). If the sudden transformation would prove fatal to the creature (such as
      fusing a swimming airbreathing subject, or a flying subject), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save. Unless it
      loses the use of its senses (see below), the creature can still perform purely mental actions, such as manifesting
      powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the target fails its Fortitude save to avoid the power’s effect, the subject must immediately attempt a second
      Fortitude save. If this second save is failed, the creature’s eyes and ears fuse over, effectively blinding and
      deafening it. Moreover, it loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, as well as its ability
      to manifest powers (if any), and is generally in sorry shape.

      You and another willing, corporeal, living creature of the same or smaller size fuse into one being. As the
      manifester, you control the actions of the fused being. However, you can give up this control to the other
      creature. Once you give up control, you cannot regain it unless the other creature relinquishes it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fused being has your current hit points plus the other creature’s current hit points. The fused being knows
      all the powers you and the other creature know, has the sum of your and the other creature’s power points, and
      knows or has prepared any spells you or the other creature possesses (if any). Likewise, all feats, racial
      abilities, and class features are pooled (if both creatures have the same ability, the fused being gains it only
      once). For each of the six ability scores, the fused being’s score is the higher of yours and the other
      creature’s, and the fused being also has the higher Hit Dice or manifester level—this effectively means the fused
      being uses the better saving throws, attack bonus, and skill modifiers of either member, and it manifests powers
      at the higher of the manifester levels that you or the other creature possessed before becoming fused.
    </p>
    <p>
      You decide what equipment is absorbed into the fused being and what equipment remains available for use. These
      fused items are restored once the power ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the power ends, the fused being separates. The other creature appears in an area adjacent to you that you
      determine. If separation occurs in a cramped space, the other creature is expelled through the Astral Plane,
      finally coming to rest materially in the nearest empty space and taking 1d6 points of damage for each 10 feet of
      solid material passed through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damage taken by the fused being is split evenly between you and the other creature when the power ends. You do not
      leave the <i>fusion</i> with more hit points than you entered it with, unless you were damaged prior to the
      <i>fusion</i> and the fused being was subsequently healed. In a like manner, the fused being’s remaining power
      points are split between you and the other creature (you can leave with more points than you entered with, as long
      as you don’t exceed the maximum power points for your level and ability score). Ability damage and negative levels
      are also split between you and the other creature. (If an odd number of negative levels or ability score
      reductions must be split, you decide whether you or the other creature receives the additional loss.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If a fused being is killed, it separates into its constituent creatures, both ofwhich are also dead. You cannot
      use <i>fission</i> on a fused being.
