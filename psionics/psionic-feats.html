    <h1>PSIONIC FEATS</h1>
    <p>
      Psionic feats are available only to characters and creatures with the ability to manifest powers. (In other words,
      they either have a power point reserve or have psi-like abilities.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Because psionic feats are supernatural abilities—a departure from the general rule that feats do not grant
      supernatural abilities—they cannot be disrupted in combat (as powers can be) and generally do not provoke attacks
      of opportunity (except as noted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not subject to power resistance
      and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where psionics is suppressed, such as a
      <i>null psionics field.</i> Leaving such an area immediately allows psionic feats to be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many psionic feats can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to expend your psionic
      focus to gain their benefit. Expending your psionic focus does not require an action; it is part of another action
      (such as using a feat). When you expend your psionic focus, it applies only to the action for which you expended
      it.
    </p>

    <h2 id="psionic-item-creation-feats">Psionic Item Creation Feats</h2>
    <p>
      Manifesters can use their personal power to create lasting psionic items. Doing so, however, is draining. A
      manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every psionic item he or she creates.
    </p>
    <p>
      A psionic item creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of
      items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-creation-feats--xp-cost">XP Cost:</strong> Power and energy that the manifester would
      normally keep is expended when making a psionic item. The experience point cost of using a psionic item creation
      feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or
      she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on
      creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-creation-feats--raw-materials-cost">Raw Materials Cost:</strong> Creating a psionic item
      requires costly components, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of these materials equals 1/2 the
      cost of the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a psionic item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop, special tools, and
      other equipment. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply (such
      as if he’s traveling far from home).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-creation-feats--time">Time:</strong> The time to create a psionic item depends on the
      feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-creation-feats--item-cost">Item Cost:</strong> Craft Dorje, Imprint Stone, and Scribe
      Tattoo create items that directly reproduce the effects of powers, and the strength of these items depends on
      their manifester level—that is, a power from such an item has the strength it would have if manifested by a
      manifester of that level. Often, that is the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly
      discovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item, the item’s strength can be set
      higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates an item using a power augmented by spending additional power
      points, the character’s effective manifester level for the purpose of calculating the item’s cost increases by 1
      for each 1 additional power point spent. (Augmentation is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be
      amplified in various ways if additional power points are spent.) All other level-dependent parameters of the power
      forged into the item are set according to the effective manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The price of psionic items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends on the level of the
      power and a character’s manifester level. The character’s manifester level must be high enough that the item
      creator can manifest the power at the chosen level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character’s
      manifester level by the power level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="psionic-item-creation-feats--item-cost--power-stones">Power Stones:</em> Base price = power level x
      manifester level x 25 gp
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="psionic-item-creation-feats--item-cost--psionic-tattoos">Psionic Tattoos:</em> Base price = power level x

    <p>
      <em id="psionic-item-creation-feats--item-cost--dorjes">Dorjes:</em> Base price = power level x manifester level x
      750 gp
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="psionic-item-creation-feats--extra-costs">Extra Costs:</strong> Any dorje, power stone, or psionic
      tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      For psionic tattoos and power stones, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the item. For a dorje, the
      creator must pay fifty times the XP cost.
    </p>
    <p>Some psionic items similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
    <h2 id="metapsionic-feats">Metapsionic Feats</h2>
    <p>
      As a manifester’s knowledge of psionics grows, he can learn to manifest powers in ways slightly different from how
      the powers were originally designed or learned. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic feat is
      more expensive than manifesting the power normally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="metapsionic-feats--manifesting-time">Manifesting Time:</strong> Powers manifested using metapsionic
      feats take the same time as manifesting the powers normally unless the feat description specifically says
      otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="metapsionic-feats--manifestation-cost">Manifestation Cost:</strong> To use a metapsionic feat, a
      psionic character must both expend his psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description) and pay an
      increased power point cost as given in the feat description.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="metapsionic-feats--limits-on-use">Limits on Use:</strong> As with all powers, you cannot spend more
      power points on a power than your manifester level. Metapsionic feats merely let you manifest powers in different
      ways; they do not let you violate this rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="metapsionic-feats--effects-of-metapsionic-feats-on-a-power"
        >Effects of Metapsionic Feats on a Power:</strong
      >
      In all ways, a metapsionic power operates at its original power level, even though it costs additional power
      points. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic feat have only their noted effect on the power. A
      manifester can’t use a metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or other device.
    </p>
    <p>Manifesting a power modified by the Quicken Power feat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
    <p>Some metapsionic feats apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific feat entry.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="metapsionic-feats--psionic-items-and-metapsionic-powers"
        >Psionic Items and Metapsionic Powers:</strong
      >
      With the right psionic item creation feat, you can store a metapsionic power in a power stone, psionic tattoo, or
      dorje. Level limits for psionic tattoos apply to the power’s higher metapsionic level.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character doesn’t need the appropriate metapsionic feat to activate an item in which a metapsionic power is
      stored, but does need the metapsionic feat to create such an item.
    </p>
    <h2 id="feat-descriptions">Feat Descriptions</h2>
    <p>These feat descriptions follow the standard format.</p>
    <h3 id="feat-descriptions--aligned-attack-psionic">Aligned Attack <small>[Psionic]</small></h3>
    <p>
      Your melee or ranged attack overcomes your opponent’s alignment-based damage reduction and deals additional
      damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--aligned-attack-psionic--prerequisite">Prerequisite:</strong> Base attack bonus +6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--aligned-attack-psionic--benefit">Benefit:</strong> When you take this feat, choose
      either chaos, good, evil or law. (Your choice must match one of your alignment components. Once you’ve made this
      alignment choice, it cannot be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. When you make a successful melee or ranged attack, you deal
      an extra 1d6 points of damage, and your attack is treated as either a good, evil, chaotic, or lawful attack
      (depending on your original choice) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend
      your psionic focus.
    </p>
    <h3 id="feat-descriptions--antipsionic-magic-general">Antipsionic Magic <small>[General]</small></h3>
    <p>Your spells are more potent when used against psionic characters and creatures.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--antipsionic-magic-general--prerequisite">Prerequisite:</strong> Spellcraft 5 ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--antipsionic-magic-general--benefit">Benefit:</strong> You get a get a +2 bonus on
      caster level checks made to overcome a psionic creature’s power resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bonus stacks with the bonus conferred by Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration. Moreover, whenever
      a psionic creature attempts to dispel a spell you cast, it makes its manifester level check against a DC of 13 +
      its manifester level.
    </p>
    <p>The benefits of this feat apply only to power resistance.</p>
    <p>The bonus does not apply to spell resistance. This is an exception to the psionics–magic transparency rule.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--antipsionic-magic-general--special">Special:</strong> You cannot take or use this
      feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).
    </p>
    <h3 id="feat-descriptions--autonomous-general">Autonomous <small>[General]</small></h3>
    <p>You have a knack for psionic self-sufficiency.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--autonomous-general--benefit">Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all
      Autohypnosis checks and Knowledge (psionics) checks.
    </p>
    <h3 id="feat-descriptions--body-fuel-psionic">Body Fuel <small>[Psionic]</small></h3>
    <p>You can expand your power point total at the expense of your health.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--body-fuel-psionic--benefit">Benefit:</strong> You can recover 2 power points by
      taking 1 point of ability burn damage to each of your three ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can recover additional power points for a proportional cost to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. These
      recovered points are added to your power point reserve as if you had gained them by resting overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--body-fuel-psionic--special">Special:</strong> Only living creatures can use this
      feat. You can take advantage of this feat only while in your own body.
    </p>
    <h3 id="feat-descriptions--boost-construct-psionic">Boost Construct <small>[Psionic]</small></h3>
    <p>Your astral constructs have more abilities.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--boost-construct-psionic--benefit">Benefit:</strong> When you create an astral
      construct, you can give it one additional special ability from any menu that the construct currently has an
      ability from.
    </p>
    <h3 id="feat-descriptions--burrowing-power-metapsionic">Burrowing Power <small>[Metapsionic]</small></h3>
    <p>Your powers sometimes bypass barriers.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--burrowing-power-metapsionic--benefit">Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must
      expend your psionic focus. You can attempt to manifest your powers against targets that are sheltered behind a
      wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through the Astral Plane to bypass the barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strength and thickness of the barrier determine your chance of success. To successfully bypass the barrier
      with your power, you make a Psicraft check against a DC equal to 10 + the hardness of the barrier + 1 per foot of
      thickness (minimum 1). Assign a hardness of 20 to barriers without a hardness rating, such as force effects (or a
      <i>wall of ectoplasm</i>). Force walls or <i>walls of ectoplasm</i> are assumed to have less than 1 foot of
      thickness unless noted otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a power requires line of sight (which includes most powers that affect a target or targets instead of an area),
      you cannot manifest it as a burrowing power unless you can somehow see the target, such as with
      <i>clairvoyant sense</i>. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power’s total cost
      cannot exceed your manifester level.
    </p>
    <h3 id="feat-descriptions--chain-power-metapsionic">Chain Power <small>[Metapsionic]</small></h3>
    <p>You can manifest powers that arc to hit other targets in addition to the primary target.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--chain-power-metapsionic--benefit">Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must
      expend your psionic focus. You can chain any power that affects a single target and that deals either acid, cold,
      electricity, fire, or sonic damage. After the primary target is struck, the power can arc to a number of secondary
      targets equal to your manifester level (maximum twenty). The secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half
      as much damage as the primary one did (round down).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each target gets to make a saving throw, if one is allowed by the power. You choose secondary targets as you like,
      but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can
      choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example).
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your
      manifester level.
    </p>
    <h3 id="feat-descriptions--chaotic-mind-general">Chaotic Mind <small>[General]</small></h3>
    <p>The turbulence of your thoughts prevents others from gaining insight into your actions.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--chaotic-mind-general--prerequisite">Prerequisite:</strong> Chaotic alignment, Cha
      15.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--chaotic-mind-general--benefit">Benefit:</strong> Creatures and characters who have
      an insight bonus on their attack rolls, an insight bonus to their Armor Class, or an insight bonus on skill checks
      or ability checks do not gain those bonuses against you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The benefit of this feat applies only to insight bonuses gained from psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This
      is an exception to the psionics–magic transparency rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--chaotic-mind-general--special">Special:</strong> You cannot take or use this feat
      if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).

      (dance) 2 ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--cloak-dance-general--benefit">Benefit:</strong> You can take a move action to
      obscure your exact position. Until your next turn, you have concealment. Alternatively, you can take a full-round
      action to entirely obscure your exact position. Until your next action, you have total concealment.

    <p>Your mind is better able to resist psionics than normal.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--closed-mind-general--benefit">Benefit:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on all saving
      throws to resist powers.
    </p>

      <i>cognizance crystal</i>. Doing so takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a
      <i>cognizance crystal</i> is equal to the highest-level power it could manifest using all its stored power points,
      squared, multiplied by 1,000 gp. To create a <i>cognizance crystal</i>, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in
      XP and use up raw materials costing one-half its base price.

      psionic power you know (barring exceptions, such as <i>bestow power</i>, as noted in a power’s description).
      Crafting a dorje takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a dorje is its manifester
      level x the power level x 750 gp. To craft a dorje, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw

      <strong id="feat-descriptions--delay-power-metapsionic--benefit">Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must
      expend your psionic focus. You can manifest a power as a delayed power. A delayed power doesn’t activate
      immediately. When you manifest the power, you choose one of three trigger mechanisms: (1) The power activates when
      you take a standard action to activate it; (2) It activates when a creature enters the area that the power will
      affect (only powers that affect areas can use this trigger condition); or (3) It activates on your turn after 5
      rounds pass. If you choose one of the first two triggers and the conditions are not met within 5 rounds, the power
      activates automatically on the fifth round.
    </p>
    <p>Only area and personal powers can be delayed.</p>
    <p>
      Any decisions you would make about the delayed power, including attack rolls, designating targets, or determining
      or shaping an area, are decided when the power is manifested. Any effects resolved by those affected by the power,
      including saving throws, are decided when the delay period ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      A delayed power can be dispelled normally during the delay, and can be detected normally in the area or on the
      target by the use of powers that can detect psionic effects.

      a range of 200 feet + 20 feet per level, and a long-range power has a range of 800 feet + 80 feet per level.

      <strong id="feat-descriptions--twin-power-metapsionic--benefit">Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must

      effect twice on the area or target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting the same power two times on the same
      location or target. Any variables in the power (such as duration, number of targets, and so on) are the same for
      both of the resulting powers. The target experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a
      saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some cases, such as a twinned <i>psionic charm</i>, failing both saving
      throws results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on
      two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm effect).

      You can manifest an unconditional power when you are dazed, <i>confused,</i> nauseated, shaken, or stunned.
    </p>
    <p>Only personal powers and powers that affect your person can be manifested as unconditional powers.</p>
    <p>
      Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 8. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your
      manifester level.

    <h3 id="feat-descriptions--up-the-walls-psionic">Up the Walls <small>[Psionic]</small></h3>
    <p>You can run on walls for brief distances.</p>
    <p><strong id="feat-descriptions--up-the-walls-psionic--prerequisite">Prerequisite:</strong> Wis 13.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--up-the-walls-psionic--benefit">Benefit:</strong> While you are psionically focused,
      you can take part of one of your move actions to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if
      you begin and end your move on a horizontal surface. The height you can achieve on the wall is limited only by
      this movement restriction. If you do not end your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling
      damage as appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of
      measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall or wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces
      freely. Opponents on the ground can make attacks of opportunity as you move up the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--up-the-walls-psionic--special">Special:</strong> You can take other move actions in
      conjunction with moving along a wall. For instance, the Spring Attack feat allows you to make an attack from the
      wall against a foe standing on the ground who is within the area you threaten; however, if you are somehow
      prevented from completing your move, you fall. Likewise, you could tumble along the wall to avoid attacks of
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <h3 id="feat-descriptions--widen-power-metapsionic">Widen Power <small>[Metapsionic]</small></h3>
    <p>You can increase the area of your powers.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--widen-power-metapsionic--benefit">Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must
      expend your psionic focus. You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread-shaped power to increase its area.
      (Powers that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.) Any numeric
      measurements of the power’s area increase by 100%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power’s total cost cannot exceed your
      manifester level.
    </p>
    <h3 id="feat-descriptions--wild-talent-general">Wild Talent <small>[General]</small></h3>
    <p>Your mind wakes to a previously unrealized talent for psionics.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--wild-talent-general--benefit">Benefit:</strong> Your latent power of psionics
      flares to life, conferring upon you the designation of a psionic character. As a psionic character, you gain a
      reserve of 2 power points and can take psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats. You do
      not, however, gain the ability to manifest powers simply by virtue of having this feat.
    </p>
    <h3 id="feat-descriptions--wounding-attack-psionic">Wounding Attack <small>[Psionic]</small></h3>
    <p>Your vicious attacks wound your foe.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--wounding-attack-psionic--prerequisite">Prerequisite:</strong> Base attack bonus +8.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--wounding-attack-psionic--benefit">Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must
      expend your psionic focus. You can make an attack with such vicious force that you wound your opponent. A wound
      deals 1 point of Constitution damage to your foe in addition to the usual damage dealt.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend
      your psionic focus.
