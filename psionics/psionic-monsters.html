    <h1>PSIONIC MONSTERS</h1>

    <h2 id="psionic-creatures">Psionic Creatures</h2>
    <p>
      Any creature with psionic powers has the psionic subtype. A psionic creature can be born with the subtype or can
      gain the subtype during its life.
    </p>
    <p>A creature meeting any one of the following criteria has the psionic subtype:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Creatures with a power point reserve, including characters who have levels in a character class that grants them
        a power point reserve or creatures who have the Wild Talent feat.
      </li>
      <li>Creatures with psi-like abilities, including characters who have racial psi-like abilities.</li>
      <li>Creatures that have spell-like abilities described as “psionics.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <em id="psionic-creatures--traits">Traits:</em> Other than the fact that all psionic creatures have psionic
      powers, power points, or psi-like abilities, psionic creatures have no specific traits. The psionic subtype serves
      to identify creatures that may be vulnerable to powers, spells, and effects targeting psionic creatures.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-psionic-subtype">The Psionic Subtype</h2>
    <p>
      The psionic subtype applies to creatures that can use psionic powers or abilities or that have the ability to
      manifest powers. (In other words, a creature with the psionic subtype either has a power point reserve or has
      psi-like abilities.) It also applies to creatures from other sources that have spell-like abilities labeled as
      “psionics.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters who have levels in any class that grants the use of psionics, or who have psi-like abilities as racial
      traits, gain the psionic subtype.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="the-psionic-subtype--traits">Traits:</strong> Other than the fact that all psionic creatures have
      psionic powers or psi-like abilities, psionic creatures have no specific traits. The psionic subtype simply
      identifies creatures that may be vulnerable to powers, spells, and effects targeting psionic creatures.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-psionic-subtype--undead-psionic-creatures">Undead Psionic Creatures</h3>
    <p>A psionic undead creature, although rare, is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
    <p>
      Because undead are immune to mind-affecting effects (including charms and compulsions), they are particularly
      threatening to other psionic creatures and characters (especially telepaths). Psionic undead creatures can use
      mind-affecting powers on the living, even though they themselves are immune to such attacks. However, an undead
      creature may have the psionic subtype if it meets the criteria described above, and thus be vulnerable to
      non-mindaffecting powers or effects that specifically affect psionic creatures.
    </p>
    <p>Intelligent constructs and plants with psionic powers or psi-like abilities also share this advantage.</p>
    <h2 id="psionic-powers">Psionic Powers</h2>
    <p>
      Creatures with psionic powers are similar to creatures with racial spellcasting ability. They have the ability to
      manifest powers just as a member of a psionic character class can (and can activate psionic items accordingly).
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures with the ability to use powers are subject to the same rules for manifesting powers that characters are,
      but they are not actually members of a class and do not gain any class abilities unless otherwise specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures with psionic powers generally emulate the manifesting ability of a particular psionic class. When such a
      creature takes levels in that same class, it can stack its innate psionic powers and its class power progression
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures with psionic powers that take levels in a class other than the one they emulate combine their two power
      point reserves into a single reserve, but they manifest powers from each psionic class separately.
    </p>
    <h2 id="psi-like-abilities">Psi-Like Abilities</h2>
    <p>
      Most psionic monsters have some number of psi-like abilities. These are very similar to spell-like abilities.
      Naturally, they are psionic and work just like powers or spells. A creature with psi-like abilities does not pay
      for these abilities with power points and does not pay any XP cost associated with manifesting the power the
      ability duplicates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psi-like abilities do not work in a <i>null psionics field</i> and are subject to power resistance if the power or
      spell the ability duplicates would be subject to power resistance. A psi-like ability usually has a limit on how
      often it can be used. A psi-like ability that can be used at will has no use limit. Using a psi-like ability is a
      standard action unless noted otherwise, and doing so while threatened provokes attacks of opportunity. It is
      possible to make a Concentration check to use a psi-like ability defensively and avoid provoking attacks of
      opportunity, just as when using a power or casting a spell. A psi-like ability can be interrupted just as a spell
      can be. Psi-like abilities cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      All creatures with psi-like abilities are assigned a manifester level, which indicates how difficult it is to
      dispel their psi-like effects and determines all level-dependent variables (such as range or duration) the
      abilities might have. When a creature uses a psi-like ability, the power is manifested as if the creature had
      spent a number of power points equal to its manifester level, which may augment the power to improve its damage or
      save DC. However, the creature does not actually spend power points for its psi-like abilities, even if it has a
      power point reserve due to racial abilities, class levels, or some other psionic ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DC of a saving throw (if applicable) against a creature’s psi-like ability is 10 + the level of the power or
      spell the ability duplicates + the creature’s Cha modifier. Remember to check the power’s Augment entry to see if
      the creature’s manifester level (and thus the effective power point expenditure) increases the DC of the saving
      throw. Changes to the effect’s save DC, damage, and so on are noted in the psi-like ability entry.
    </p>
    <h3 id="psi-like-abilities--psionic-focus">Psionic Focus</h3>
    <p>
      Some creatures have feats that can be used only when the creature is psionically focused, or that require the
      creature to expend its psionic focus. Assume that such a creature is psionically focused before entering combat.
    </p>
    <h3 id="psi-like-abilities--psi-like-abilities-and-feats">Psi-Like Abilities and Feats</h3>
    <p>
      Creatures with access to psi-like abilities can use the feats Empower Spell-Like Ability and Quicken Spell-Like
      Ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      These feats can be used only on psi-like abilities that do not have increased effects due to augmentation.
      Furthermore, the creature can empower only a psi-like ability with a level less than or equal to half its
      manifester level (round down) minus 2, and can quicken only a psi-like ability with a level less than or equal to
      half its manifester level (round down) minus 4.
    </p>
    <h3 id="psi-like-abilities--creatures-with-psionics-entries">Creatures with “Psionics” Entries</h3>
    <p>
      Psionic monsters often possess spell-like abilities that are identified as “psionics,” instead of “spell-like
      abilities.” For all intents and purposes, creatures with spell-like abilities described as psionics are considered
      to possess psi-like abilities, and they manifest their powers as described above.
    </p>
    <h3 id="psi-like-abilities--psionic-spells">Psionic Spells</h3>
    <p>
      In some cases, a creature’s psi-like abilities (or abilities listed under a creature’s psionics entry) may include
      an effect that does not duplicate any listed power. For such abilities, simply use the existing spell description.
      Treat the creature’s
    </p>
    <p>
      manifester level as the caster level for the spell. The ability is still psionic in origin, so spells and powers
      that specifically affect psionic powers can negate or reduce its effects as they would any other psionic power.
    </p>
    <h3 id="psi-like-abilities--psionic-versions-of-creatures">Psionic Versions of Creatures</h3>
    <p>
      Below are presented psionic versions of the following creatures: aboleth, couatl, and duergar,. These alternate
      versions are psionic equivalents of their standard counterparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the portions of the monster entry that are specifically changed by the addition of psionics rules have been
      listed. All other elements of the creature remain the same.
    </p>
    <h2 id="reading-psionic-creature-entries">Reading Psionic Creature Entries</h2>
    <h3 id="reading-psionic-creature-entries--creatures-with-psi-like-abilities">Creatures with Psi-Like Abilities</h3>
    <p>
      Each of a creature’s psi-like abilities has a manifester level. Each ability that allows a saving throw also gives
      a save DC in parentheses following the power name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Powers that have increased effects due to augmentation include information about the effect. An asterisk indicates
      that the power has already been augmented by the creature’s innate ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Powers that can’t be augmented, or that are manifested at their normal minimum level, do not contain any special
      notations. Resolve the effect of manifesting the power without augmentation at the creature’s given manifester
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some creatures may have particular powers that are manifested at a higher or lower level than their normal
      manifester level. In such cases, the manifester level is given in the parenthetical information following the
      power name.
    </p>
    <h2 id="aboleth-psionic">Aboleth, Psionic</h2>
    <p>Huge Aberration (Aquatic, Psionic)</p>

    <p>
      A psionic aboleth does not possess spell-like abilities or the enslave ability of the standard aboleth. Instead,
      it has psi-like abilities, including <i>psionic dominate.</i>

    <p>*Includes augmentation for the aboleth’s manifester level.</p>
    <h2 id="astral-construct">Astral Construct</h2>
    <p>
      Astral constructs are brought into being by the metacreativity power
      <i>astral construct</i>. They are formed from raw ectoplasm (a portion of the astral medium drawn into the
      Material Plane). The power points spent by the construct’s creator during the manifestation of the power determine
      the level of the astral construct created. However, even astral constructs of the same level vary somewhat from
      each other, depending on the whims of their creators.
    </p>
    <h3 id="astral-construct--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Astral constructs act as directed by their creators. As a free action, a construct’s manifester can direct the
      construct to attack particular enemies, use specific tactics or powers, perform other actions, or do nothing at
      all. The construct does exactly what its creator directs it to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      An astral construct generally appears as an animate clump of ectoplasm with a vaguely humanoid shape, but the
      manifester can mold or sculpt one according to his or her whim within the limits imposed by the creature’s size.
      The quality of such “construct sculpture” is determined by a Craft (sculpting) check. A result of 10 to 19 creates
      a creature that is recognizably similar to the desired creature shape; a result of 20 to 29 creates a construct
      that looks like an accurate portrayal of that creature type; a result of 30 or higher creates a construct that
      looks like a specific individual. No matter how high the Craft (sculpting) check result, though, an astral
      construct’s appearance can’t hide the otherworldly material from which it is formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="astral-construct--combat--construct-traits">Construct Traits:</strong> An astral construct has
      immunity to poison, <i>sleep,</i> paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, mind-affecting
      effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that requires a Fortitude
      save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability
      damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it can be repaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="astral-construct--combat--special-abilities">Special Abilities:</strong> Every time an astral
      construct is created, the manifester can choose to apply one special ability to the construct. When the manifester
      begins to manifest the <i>astral construct</i> power, he chooses one or more special abilities from a menu of
      abilities appropriate to that level of astral construct.
    </p>
    <h3 id="astral-construct--creating-an-astral-construct">Creating an Astral Construct</h3>
    <p>
      When manifesting the <i>astral construct</i> power, the manifester assembles the desired creature from a menu of
      choices, as specified in the construct’s statistics block. A manifester can always substitute two choices from a
      lesser menu for one of its given abilities. Multiple selections of the same menu choice do not stack unless the
      ability specifically notes that stacking is allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some menu choices grant an astral construct the ability to manifest specific powers as psi-like abilities. Unless
      using the ability is a free action, an astral construct manifesting such a power does so as a standard action that
      provokes attacks of opportunity. All such powers have a manifester level equal to the astral construct’s Hit Dice
      or the creator’s manifester level, whichever is lower.
    </p>
    <p>An astral construct does not need to meet the prerequisites for a feat granted by a menu choice.</p>
    <h3 id="astral-construct--astral-construct-menu-a">Astral Construct Menu a</h3>
    <p>
      A manifester creating a 1st-level, 2nd-level, or 3rd-level astral construct can choose one special ability from

      Blues are a subrace of goblins with an innate knack for psionics. A blue is often smaller than an average goblin,
      standing just about 3 feet tall and weighing about 40 pounds. Blues have noticeably blue-tinged skin, and their
      eyes are less dull than those of a common goblin. Otherwise, they resemble their kin. They generally dress in
      short leather robes, dyed black.

      Brain moles are burrowing animals that use psionic powers to overcome large psionic prey. Small, furry, and nearly
      blind, brain moles are almost indistinguishable from their common animal cousins.
    </p>
    <p>Brain moles eat small insects when they can’t get psionic energy.</p>
    <h3 id="brain-mole--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      Brain moles hunger for psionic energy. They hide in loose dirt and detritus on forest floors, watching for the
      approach of psionic creatures with their <i>detect psionics</i> power. When a suitable target comes in range, the
      brain moles then attack with their <i>power leech</i> ability. The moles remain hidden as long as possible. If
      threatened, they use <i>aversion</i> and <i>mind thrust</i> to discourage attackers, using their bite only as a
      last resort.

      A caller in darkness is an incorporeal creature composed of the minds of dozens of victims who died together in

      creature slain by a caller in darkness’s touch attack is mentally absorbed into the monster’s consciousness. (The
      physical body of the victim remains intact). Stealing a victim’s essence is a free action; it grants the caller 12
      temporary hit points, and a permanent new screaming face appears within its cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      A caller in darkness can also steal the essence of living, intelligent creatures within 30 feet that are paralyzed
      or sleeping, or that are helpless due to having a mental ability score reduced to 0 (often by the caller’s
      <i>ego whip</i> attack). Doing so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The victim dies, and
      the caller gains 12 temporary hit points.

      harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural
      abilities. It has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks
      made with ghost touch weapons. It can pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its attacks
      ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against them. The

      nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion,

      panicked until it is no longer within 30 feet of the caller in darkness. A panicked creature that is cornered
      begins cowering. The save DC is Charisma-based.

      <strong id="caller-in-darkness--combat--vulnerability-to-sunlight-ex">Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex):</strong>
      Callers in darkness are utterly powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a <i>daylight</i> spell) and flee from

      but not both (nor can it take full-round actions).

      These abilities are as the power (or spell) manifested by a psion (or sorcerer) of the duergar’s Hit Dice (minimum
      3rd level) and affect only the duergar and whatever he carries.
    </p>
    <h3 id="duergar-psionic--duergar-as-characters">Duergar as Characters</h3>
    <p>Duergar characters possess the following racial traits.</p>
    <p>— +2 Constitution, –4 Charisma.</p>
    <p>—Medium size.</p>
    <p>
      —Duergar base land speed is 20 feet. However, gray dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium or
      heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such
      situations).
    </p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 120 feet.</p>
    <p>—Immunity to paralysis, phantasms, and poison.</p>
    <p>— +2 racial bonus on saves against spells and spell-like effects.</p>
    <p>
      —Stability: Duergar are exceptionally stable on their feet. A duergar receives a +4 bonus on ability checks made
      to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding or
      otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).
    </p>
    <p>
      —Stonecunning: This ability grants a duergar a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such
      as sliding walls, stonework, traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces,
      shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn’t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as
      unusual stonework. A gray dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if
      he were actively searching, and a duergar can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A
      duergar can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which
      way is up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duergar have a sixth sense about stonework, an innate ability that they get plenty of opportunity to practice and
      hone in their underground homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Psi-Like Abilities: 1/day—expansion, invisibility. These abilities affect only the duergar and whatever he
      carries. Manifester level is equal to Hit Dice (minimum 3rd).
    </p>
    <p>
      —Naturally Psionic: Duergar gain 3 bonus power points at 1st level. This benefit does not grant them the ability
      to manifest powers unless they gain that ability through another source, such as levels in a psionic class.
    </p>
    <p>
      — +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs (including half-orcs) and goblinoids (including goblins,
      hobgoblins, and bugbears).
    </p>
    <p>— +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).</p>
    <p>—Light Sensitivity (Ex): Duergar are dazzled in sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.</p>
    <p>
      —Duergar have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks and a +1 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks. They have
      a +2 racial bonus on Appraise and Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.
    </p>
    <p>—Automatic Languages: Common, Dwarven, Undercommon. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran.</p>

      A gray glutton attacks anything psionic, or anything that stands in its way of tracking down new psionic prey. Of
      course, a gray glutton has to eat—and eat a lot to feed its bulk—so when not on the scent it will attack any
      living creature. It always breaks off attacks against nonpsionic foes if psionic prey is an option. The only
      creatures it refuses to eat are elves (and it dislikes the taste of dwarves). No challenge seems too extreme to
      it, even if that means bulling into the center of a powerful party of manifesters.

      subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush
      attempts, and trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A
      half-giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature’s special attacks based on
      size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature
      one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The
      benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s

      Intellect devourers understand Common but must be in possession of a body to speak. An intellect devourer in
      possession of a body also knows the languages known by that victim.

    <p>
      <strong id="intellect-devourer--combat--body-thief-su">Body Thief (Su):</strong> When an intellect devourer
      overcomes a lone victim, it consumes the victim’s brain and enters the skull. As a full-round action that provokes
      attacks of opportunity, the devourer can merge its form with that of a helpless or dead creature of Small size or
      larger. The devourer cannot merge its body with that of a creature immune to extra damage from critical hits.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an intellect devourer completes its merging, it psionically consumes the brain of the victim (which kills it
      if it is not already dead). The devourer can exit the body at any time as a standard action, bursting the victim’s
      skull and resuming its normal form.
    </p>
    <p>
      After consuming its victim’s brain, an intellect devourer can instead choose to animate the body for up to seven
      days as if it were the victim’s original brain. The devourer retains its hit points, saving throws, and mental
      ability scores, as well as its psi-like abilities. It assumes the physical qualities and ability scores of the
      victim, as if it had used
      <i>polymorph</i> to assume the victim’s form. As long as the intellect devourer occupies the body, it knows the
      languages spoken by the victim and very basic information about the victim’s identity and personality, but none of
      the victim’s specific memories or knowledge.

      Monsters who naturally possess psionic ability are not found as phrenic creatures. Phrenic creatures are freaks
      among their kind, otherwise normal creatures whose minds are more powerful than those of their fellows. Similarly,
      creatures who advance by character class are usually not phrenic creatures—they simply take levels in a psionic

      “Phrenic” is an inherited template that can be added to any nonmindless creature that does not already have the

      A psion-killer (also called a crystal golem) is 9-1/2 feet tall and weighs around 2,500 pounds. Its body is
      composed of sharply faceted crystal.

    <h3 id="psion-killer--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      A psion-killer does nothing without explicit orders from its creator. It follows instructions literally and is
      incapable of any strategy or tactics. Psion-killers don’t use weapons, even if ordered to, but always strike with
      their fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      A psion-killer’s creator can command it if the psion-killer is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If
      uncommanded, a psion-killer usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it
      returns the attack. Its creator can give a psion-killer a simple command to govern its actions in his or her
      absence.

    <p>
      An udoroot can be killed only if its root is dug up or exposed, then burned, hacked apart, or otherwise destroyed.
      Severing or destroying all six crowns puts the plant out of commission, allowing excavation of the helpless root.
      The crowns are Medium objects with a hardness of 5 and 7 hit points. To sever a crown, an opponent must use the
      sunder action. The crowns can also be affected by spells or effects that affect an area or targeted by spells that
      affect an individual target.
    </p>
    <p>
      An udoroot takes no damage from having a crown severed or destroyed. A severed crown dies and can no longer be
      used to attack, but the udoroot takes no other penalties. As long as the root system remains intact, the crown
      regrows in about a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="udoroot--combat--double-manifest-ex">Double Manifest (Ex):</strong> An udoroot senses its surroundings
      and manifests its psi-like abilities through its crowns. It can manifest two psi-like abilities per round, as long
      as it has at least two crowns remaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="udoroot--combat--psi-like-abilities">Psi-Like Abilities:</strong> At will—<i>energy stun</i>
      (electricity, 2d6, DC 15*), <i>false sensory input</i> (DC 15), <i>id insinuation</i> (two targets, DC 15*),
      <i>mind thrust</i> (ML 4th, 4d10, DC 14*), <i>telekinetic force</i> (275 lb., DC 15*),
      <i>thought shield</i> (power resistance 16*); 3/day—<i>astral construct</i> (3rd level*),
      <i>body adjustment, mental barrier.</i>
    </p>
    <p>Manifester level 6th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
    <p>
      An udoroot can use its <i>body adjustment</i> power to repair damage to one of its crowns, as long as the crown
      has not been severed or destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>*Includes augmentation for the udoroot’s manifester level.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="udoroot--combat--blindsight-ex">Blindsight (Ex):</strong> An udoroot can ascertain all foes by
      nonvisual means within 60 feet. If its crowns are destroyed, it can no longer perceive its surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="udoroot--combat--plant-traits">Plant Traits:</strong> An udoroot is immune to poison, <i>sleep</i>,
      paralysis, stunning, polymorphing, and mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and
      morale effects). It is not subject to critical hits.
