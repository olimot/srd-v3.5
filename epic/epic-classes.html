    <p>
      Epic level psionic characters follow the same epic progression as non-psionics epic characters, except as noted
      below.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For manifesters, manifester level continues to increase after 20th level. However, a manifester’s power points
        and powers known at each level do not increase automatically after 20th level.
      </li>
      <li>
        The powers of psicrystals that are based on the creator’s level continue to increase as their owner gains
        levels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bonus feats for epic psionic classes can be chosen from among any epic feats for which the character meets the
        prerequisites or any psionic, metapsionic, or psionic item creation feat, as normal.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="no-epic-bonus-power-progression">No Epic Bonus Power Progression</h3>
    <p>
      Epic psionic characters do not gain additional bonus power points above 20th. They may still gain more power
      points as their key ability score increases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psionic characters can take the Improved Manifestation feat, which grants them additional power points each time
      they take the feat. Epic manifesters can also take Epic Expanded Knowledge or Power Knowledge, which give them
      access to additional powers, and Epic Psionic Focus, which allows manifesters to use more than one metapsionic
      power each time they expend their psionic focus.
    </p>
    <h2 id="epic-psion">Epic Psion</h2>
    <p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d4.</p>
    <p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</strong> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powers:</strong> The psion’s manifester level is equal to his class level. The psion’s base power points
      do not increase after 20th level. Each time the psion attains a new level, he learns two new powers of any level
      or levels that he can manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psicrystal:</strong> The epic psion’s psicrystal, if he has one, continues to increase in power. At every
      odd-numbered level higher than 20th (21st, 23rd, and so on) the psicrystal’s natural armor bonus and Intelligence
      each increase by 1. The psicrystal’s power resistance is equal to the master’s level + 5. At 21st level and again
      every ten levels higher than 21st, the psicrystal gains the benefit of the Psicrystal Power epic feat for a power
      of its master’s choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Feats:</strong> The epic psion gains a bonus feat every three levels higher than 20th (23rd, 26th,
      and so on).

      Special abilities granted to a psycrystal continue to grow as the level of its master increases beyond 20th, as
      shown on Table: Epic Psicrystal Special Abilities. Even though the table shows advancement only to 42nd level,
      that is not the limit. The patterns in the table continue infinitely. Psicrystal special abilities gained at less
      than 20th level also continue to improve.
