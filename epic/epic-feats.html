    <h2 id="acquiring-epic-feats">Acquiring Epic Feats</h2>
    <p>Characters gain epic feats in the following ways:</p>
    <p>
      At 21st level, and every three levels thereafter, the character may select an epic feat in place of a nonepic
      feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each character class gains bonus epic feats according to the class description. These feats must be selected from
      the list of bonus epic feats for that class.
    </p>
    <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
      Most epic feats have prerequisites. A character must have the listed ability score, feat, skill, class feature, or
      base attack modifier in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain an epic feat at the same level at
      which he or she gains the prerequisite, just as with regular feats. A prerequisite expressed as a numerical value
      is a minimum; any value higher than the one given also meets the prerequisite. A character can’t use an epic feat
      if he or she has lost a prerequisite.
    </p>
    <h2 id="types-of-epic-feats">Types of Epic Feats</h2>
    <p>
      Most epic feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others may be item creation
      feats or metamagic feats, which follow all the normal rules for such feats, except as specified in the feat’s
      description. In addition, some feats are defined as divine feats or as wild feats. Such feats are described below.
    </p>
    <h3 id="divine-feats">Divine Feats</h3>
    <p>
      The feats in this category share a few characteristics. First, they all have as a prerequisite the ability to turn
      (or, in most cases, rebuke) undead. Thus, they are open to clerics, paladins of 4th level or higher, and any
      prestige class that has that ability. (An ability to turn other creatures does not qualify a character to select
      one of these feats.) Second, the force that powers a divine feat is the ability to channel positive or negative
      energy to turn or rebuke undead. Each use of a divine feat costs the character one turn/rebuke attempt from his or
      her number of attempts each day. If a character doesn’t have any turn/rebuke attempts left, he or she can’t use
      the feat. Since turning or rebuking is a standard action, activating any of these feats is also a standard action.
    </p>
    <h3 id="wild-feats">Wild Feats</h3>
    <p>
      The feats in this category share the characteristic of relating to the ability to use <i>wild shape</i> as a
      druid. These feats require the character to have the ability to use <i>wild shape</i> before acquiring the feat.
    </p>
    <h3 id="epic-psionic-feats">Epic Psionic Feats</h3>
    <p>
      Psionic characters can acquire epic “psionically flavored” feats. Some feats require so much translation that
      converted feats are provided. Whenever a feat concerns conferring or altering a spell in some fashion, some
      translation must be done to use it with psionics. Sometimes this translation is as straightforward as changing a
      few names. Translating epic metamagic feats to epic metapsionic feats requires that Spellcraft prerequisites be
      replaced with Psicraft. It also requires a little math—instead of casting a spell at a higher level, a psionic
      character pays more power points. For every spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level the
      metamagic feat requires, the metapsionic feat requires a character to pay a power point cost equal to its standard
      cost +2. Likewise, when a feat allows a spellcaster to “pay” one less level to use a metamagic feat, the psionic
      version allows a character to pay 2 power points less for a given metapsionic feat.
    </p>
    <h2 id="feats">Feats</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one type of magic item that has a limit on the number a character can

      <strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, a character is limited to one headband, hat, or helmet; one pair of
      eye lenses or goggles; one cloak, cape, or mantle; one amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab;
      one suit of armor; one robe; one vest, vestment, or shirt; one pair of bracers or bracelets; one pair of gloves or
      gauntlets; two rings; one belt; and one pair of boots.

      it applies to a new type of wearable magic item.
    </p>
    <h3 id="armor-skin">Armor Skin <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character gains a +1 natural armor bonus to Armor Class, or his or her existing
      natural armor bonus increases by 1.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Special:</strong> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.</p>
    <h3 id="augmented-alchemy">Augmented Alchemy <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Int 21, Craft(alchemy) 24 ranks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever creating an alchemical item or substance, the character can choose to make it
      more powerful than normal by adding +20 to the DC required to create it and multiplying its price by 5. If the
      item or substance deals damage, double the damage dealt. If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage, double the
      duration of its effect. If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage and doesn’t have a specific listed duration
      (or has an instantaneous duration), double all dimensions of its area. If the item or substance doesn’t fit any of
      these categories, then it cannot be affected by this feat. See the Craft (alchemy) skill description.

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character takes the feat, the
      spells of his or her next three lowest spell levels can now be quickened with no adjustment to their spell slots.
      This feat doesn’t increase the casting time for those spells that normally become full-round actions when cast in
      metamagic form.

      spells of his or her next three lowest spell levels can now be silenced with no adjustment to their spell slots.
      This feat doesn’t increase the casting time for those spells that normally become full-round actions when cast in
      metamagic form. However, since bard spells can’t be enhanced with the Silent Spell feat, they can’t be affected by
      this feat either.
    </p>

      without using higher-level spell slots.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character takes the feat, the
      spells of his or her next three lowest spell levels can now be stilled with no adjustment to their spell slots.
      This feat doesn’t increase the casting time for those spells that normally become full-round actions when cast in

      spells of those levels, as shown on Table: Expanded Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, but only if they already
      have at least one spell slot of that level (such as from the Improved Spell Capacity feat). A character without

      high enough to award them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the table only includes ability scores up to 61 and spell slots up to 25th level, the progression
      continues infinitely in both directions. For ability scores beyond 61, or for spell slots above 25th level, expand
      the table to follow the same patterns as shown.

    <h3 id="improved-spell-resistance">Improved Spell Resistance <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Must have spell resistance from a feat, class feature, or other permanent effect.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The character’s spell resistance increases by +2.</p>
    <p><strong>Special:</strong> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.</p>
    <h3 id="improved-stunning-fist">Improved Stunning Fist <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Dex 19, Wis 19, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add +2 to the DC of the character’s stunning attack.</p>
    <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat may be taken multiple times. Its effects stack.</p>
    <h3 id="improved-whirlwind-attack">Improved Whirlwind Attack <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Int 13, Dex 23, Combat Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind
      Attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> As a standard action, the character can make one melee attack for every five points of
      his or her base attack bonus (including epic attack bonus, round fractions down).
    </p>
    <p>
      The character cannot attack any one opponent more than once as part of this action. These attacks (as well as all
      other attacks made until the start of the character’s next turn) suffer a –4 penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using the Improved Whirlwind feat, the character also forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other
      spells or abilities (such as Cleave or the haste spell).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since these attacks are made as part of a standard action the character can’t make a 5-foot step between any two
      of the attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, using the Whirlwind Attack feat requires a full attack action, and the
      character can take a 5-foot step between any two of the attacks.
    </p>
    <h3 id="incite-rage">Incite Rage <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Cha 25, greater rage class feature.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When the character enters a rage, he or she can incite a barbarian rage in any or all
      allies within 60 feet. (Any ally who doesn’t wish to become enraged is unaffected.) The ally gains +4 to Strength,
      +4 to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a –2 penalty to AC, for as long as the
      character remains raging. The rage of affected allies lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + their Constitution
      modifier, regardless of whether they remain within 60 feet of the character. This is otherwise identical with
      normal barbarian rage (including the fatigue at its end).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Special:</strong> This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
    <h3 id="infinite-deflection">Infinite Deflection <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 25, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed Strike.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character may perform any number of deflections each round, as the Deflect Arrows
      feat.
    </p>
    <h3 id="inspire-excellence">Inspire Excellence <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Perform 30 ranks, bardic music class feature.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character can use song or poetics to grant a bonus to one ability score to his or
      her allies. To be affected, an ally must hear the bard sing for 1 full round. The effect lasts as long as the bard
      sings and for 5 rounds after the bard stops singing (or 5 rounds after the ally can no longer hear the bard).
      While singing, the bard can fight but cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as
      scrolls), or activate magic items by command word (such as wands). Each ally to be inspired gains a +4 competence
      bonus to the same ability score, which the character must choose before he or she begins inspiring. Inspire
      excellence is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability. Use of this feat counts as one of the character’s bardic
      music uses for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> This feat is treated as a bardic music inspiration ability for purposes of feats that
      affect such abilities.
    </p>
    <h3 id="instant-reload">Instant Reload <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Quick Draw, Rapid Reload, Weapon Focus (crossbow type to be selected).</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character may fire the selected type of crossbow at his or her full normal attack
      rate. Reloading the crossbow does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time a
      character takes the feat, it applies to a different type of crossbow.
    </p>
    <h3 id="intensify-spell">Intensify Spell [Metamagic]<small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, Spellcraft 30 ranks, ability to cast 9th-level
      arcane or divine spells.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> All variable, numeric effects of an intensified spell are maximized, then doubled. An
      intensified spell deals twice maximum damage, cures twice the maximum number of hit points, affects twice the
      maximum number of targets, and so forth, as appropriate. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. An
      intensified spell uses up a spell slot seven levels higher than the spell’s actual level. A character can’t
      combine the effects of this feat with any other feat that affects the variable, numeric effects of a spell.
    </p>
    <h3 id="keen-strike">Keen Strike <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Str 23, Wis 23, Improved Critical (unarmed strike), Improved Unarmed Strike,
      Stunning fist, <i>ki</i> strike (adamantine).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character’s unarmed strike has a critical threat range of 18-20 and deals slashing
      damage (at the character’s option any attack can deal bludgeoning damage, but cannot then take advantage of the
      enhanced threat range). This ability doesn’t stack with other abilities that expand that character’s unarmed
      strike’s threat range.

    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character can ignore any check penalties applied for accelerated climbing or rapid

    <p>
      <strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, a character takes a –5 penalty on Climb checks when attempting to
      cover his or her full speed in climbing distance in a round, or a –20 penalty when attempting to cover twice his
      or her speed in climbing distance in a round.

    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character doesn’t take a penalty on Ride checks when riding a mount without a saddle
      (bareback). The character never needs to make a Ride check to control a mount in combat (and even controlling a
      mount not trained for combat doesn’t require an action).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, a character takes a –5 penalty on Ride checks without a saddle, and
      must make a Ride check to control a mount in combat (and controlling a mount not trained for combat requires a
      move action).
    </p>

    <p>

      prepared spell to emulate a wand charge (the character may not lose prepared spells from his or her school of
      specialty, if any). The spell slot lost must be equal to or higher in level than the spell stored in the wand,
      including any level-increasing metamagic enhancements.
    </p>
    <h3 id="mighty-rage">Mighty Rage <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Str 21, Con 21, greater rage class feature, rage 5/day.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When the character rages, he or she gains a +8 bonus to Strength and Constitution and a

    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> If the character hits an opponent with two or more weapons (wielded in different hands)
      in the same round, he or she may automatically rend the opponent. This rending deals additional damage equal to
      the base damage of the smallest weapon that hit plus 1 1/2 times the character’s Strength modifier. The character
      can only rend once per round, regardless of how many successful attacks he or she makes.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat replaces the Two-Weapon Rend feat for creatures with more than two arms.</p>
    <h3 id="music-of-the-gods">Music of the Gods <small>[Epic]</small></h3>

      energy in a 60-foot-burst. Roll a normal rebuke (or command) check, except that the negative energy burst affects
      living creatures rather than undead. Any creature that would be rebuked by this result gains one negative level.
      Any creature that would be commanded by this check gains two negative levels. The Fortitude save DC to remove
      these levels one day later is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character’s effective turning level + the character’s Charisma
      modifier.
    </p>
    <h3 id="overwhelming-critical">Overwhelming Critical<small> [Epic] </small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Str 23, Cleave, Great Cleave, Improved Critical (chosen weapon), Power Attack,

      bonus damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is x3, add +2d6 points of bonus

      hits can’t be affected by this feat.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>Select a special material, such as adamantine.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character melee weapons (including natural weapons) are treated as being crafted
      from the chosen special material for the purposes of bypassing the damage reduction of any creature the character
      strikes. None of the other special properties of special materials are gained by the character’s melee weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time the feat is selected the
      character selects a different special material. The character’s melee attacks are treated as being crafted of all
      chosen materials for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.
    </p>
    <h3 id="perfect-health">Perfect Health <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Con 25, Great Fortitude.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Dex 25, three or more hands, Greater Multiweapon Fighting, Multiweapon Fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character can make as many attacks with each extra weapon as with his or her primary
      weapon, using the same base attack bonus. The character still takes the normal penalties for fighting with two
      weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Normal:</strong> A creature without this feat can make only one attack per round with each extra weapon
      (or two attacks per round with each weapon if it has Multiweapon Fighting, or three attacks per round with each
      extra weapon if it has Greater Multiweapon Fighting). Each attack after the first extra attack has a cumulative –5
      penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> This feat replaces the Perfect Two-Weapon Fighting feat for creatures with more than two
      arms.
    </p>
    <h3 id="perfect-two-weapon-fighting">Perfect Two-Weapon Fighting <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 25, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon
      Fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character can make as many attacks with his or her off-hand weapon as with his or
      her primary weapon, using the same base attack bonus. The character still takes the normal penalties for fighting
      with two weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, a character can only get a single attack with an off-hand weapon (or
      two attacks with an off-hand weapon if he or she has Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, or three attacks with an
      off-hand weapon if he or she has Greater Two-Weapon Fighting).
    </p>
    <h3 id="permanent-emanation">Permanent Emanation <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Spellcraft 25 ranks, ability to cast the spell to be made permanent.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Designate any one of the character’s spells whose area is an emanation from the
      character. This spell’s effect is permanent (though the character can dismiss or restart it as a free action).
      Effects that would normally dispel this spell instead suppress it for 2d4 rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> This feat may be taken multiple times. Each time, select a different spell to become
      permanent.
    </p>
    <h3 id="planar-turning">Planar Turning <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wis 25, Cha 25, ability to turn or rebuke undead.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character can turn or rebuke outsiders as if they were undead. An outsider has
      effective turn resistance equal to half its spell resistance (round down). If the character can turn undead, he or
      she turns (or destroys) all evil outsiders and rebukes (or commands) all nonevil outsiders. If the character can
      rebuke undead, he or she rebukes (or commands) all evil outsiders and turns (or destroys) all nonevil outsiders.
    </p>
    <h3 id="plant-wild-shape">Plant Wild Shape <small>[Wild][Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Knowledge (nature) 24 ranks, <i>wild shape</i> 4/day.</p>

    </p>
    <h3 id="positive-energy-aura">Positive Energy Aura <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Cha 25, ability to turn undead, ability to cast <i>dispel evil.</i></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Every undead creature that comes within 15 feet of the character is automatically
      affected as if the character had turned it. This doesn’t cost a turning attempt, and the character doesn’t have to
      roll turning damage (it automatically affects all undead in a 15-foot burst), but it only turns undead with Hit
      Dice equal to or less than the character’s effective cleric level minus 10 (and automatically destroys undead with
      Hit Dice equal to or less than the character’s effective cleric level minus 20). Just as with normal turning, the
      character can’t affect undead that have total cover relative to him or her.
    </p>
    <h3 id="power-knowledge">Power Knowledge <small>[Epic, Psionic]</small></h3>
    <p>You add two additional powers to your list of powers known.</p>

      The powers you select must be on your class list or the list for your discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, you learn two new powers at any level
      up to the highest level of power you can manifest.
    </p>
    <h3 id="psicrystal-power">Psicrystal Power <small>[Epic, Psionic]</small></h3>
    <p>Your psicrystal can manifest a power.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Character level 21st, Intelligence 25 or Charisma 25 (depending on which is your
      key ability score for manifesting).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one power you know of 8th level or lower. Your psicrystal can now manifest this
      power once per day at your manifester level (the psicrystal gains sufficient power points to manifest the power
      once). You cannot bestow a power upon your psicrystal if the power normally has any experience point cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, you can give your
      psicrystal knowledge of a new power (and it gains sufficient power points to manifest that power once).
    </p>
    <p>
      All power points gained by a psicrystal from multiple applications of this feat go into its reserve and can be
      used to manifest the powers it knows as you desire.

    <h3 id="ranged-inspiration">Ranged Inspiration <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Bardic music class feature, Perform 25 ranks</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Double the range of any bardic music ability that has a range. (If the creature must
      hear the bard to be affected by the ability, that requirement doesn’t change regardless of any extended range the
      bard’s ability may have.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack. Remember that two
      doublings equals a tripling, and so forth.
    </p>
    <h3 id="rapid-inspiration">Rapid Inspiration <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Perform 25 ranks, bardic music class feature.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character can use any of his or her bardic music inspiration abilities as a standard

    </p>
    <h3 id="reactive-countersong">Reactive Countersong <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Combat Reflexes, Perform 30 ranks, bardic music class feature.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character can begin a countersong at any time, even when it isn’t his or her turn
      (much like a wizard who has readied a counterspell action), though the character doesn’t have to ready an action
      to do so. The character can’t use Reactive Countersong at the same time he or she isusing another bardic music
      ability (though the character could stop the other bardic music ability to begin Reactive Countersong if so
      desired).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, a character can only use counter-song on his or her turn.</p>
    <h3 id="reflect-arrows">Reflect Arrows <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 25, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed Strike.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When the character deflects an arrow or other ranged attack, the attack is reflected
      back upon the attacker at the character’s base ranged attack bonus.
    </p>
    <h3 id="righteous-strike">Righteous Strike <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wis 19, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, any lawful alignment.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character’s unarmed strike is treated as an axiomatic weapon (it is lawfully aligned
      and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against creatures of chaotic alignment). This ability doesn’t stack with
      similar abilities.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ruinous-rage">Ruinous Rage <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Str 25, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, rage 5/day.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> While in a rage, the character ignores the hardness of any object he or she strikes.
      Also, double the character’s Strength bonus for the purposes of any Strength check made to break an object with
      sudden force rather than by dealing normal damage (including bursting bindings, such as ropes or manacles).
    </p>
    <h3 id="scribe-epic-scroll">Scribe Epic Scroll <small>[Item Creation][Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Scribe Scroll, Knowledge (arcana) 24 ranks, Spellcraft 24 ranks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character can scribe scrolls that exceed the normal limits for such items. Even this
      feat does not allow the character to scribe a scroll with an epic spell.
    </p>
    <h3 id="self-concealment">Self-Concealment <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 30, Hide 30 ranks, Tumble 30 ranks, improved evasion.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Attacks against the character have a 10% miss chance, similar to the effect of
      concealment. The character loses this benefit whenever he or she would lose his or her Dexterity bonus to AC.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> This feat may be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the miss chance increases
      by 10% to a maximum of 50% after it has been taken five times.
    </p>
    <h3 id="shattering-strike">Shattering Strike <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Epic Weapon Focus (unarmed strike), Weapon Focus (unarmed strike), Concentration
      25 ranks, <i>ki</i> strike (adamantine).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> When using an unarmed strike to attempt to break an object with sudden force (rather
      than by dealing normal damage), make a Concentration check rather than a Strength check. The break DC remains the
      same. Using Shattering Strike is a full-round action that incurs attacks of opportunity. The character can’t use
      Shattering Strike to escape bonds (unless he or she is so bound as to allow the character to make an unarmed
      strike against his or her bindings).

    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The character’s attacks deal damage normally against incorporeal creatures.</p>

      to deal no damage.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Ability to cast spells of the maximum normal spell level of an arcane spellcasting
      class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character learns two new arcane spells of any level up to the maximum level he or
      she can cast. This feat does not grant any additional spell slots.

    <p><strong>Special:</strong> A character can gain this feat multiple times.</p>
    <h3 id="spell-opportunity">Spell Opportunity <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Combat Casting, Combat Reflexes, Quicken Spell, Spellcraft 25 ranks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever the character is allowed an attack of opportunity, he or she may cast (and
      attack with) a touch spell as the character’s attack of opportunity. This incurs attacks of opportunity just as if
      the character had cast the spell normally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, a character can only make a melee attack as an attack of opportunity.

    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Spellcraft 24 ranks, caster level 12th.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose a spell-like ability the character knows, or a spell the character cam cast. The
      character is attuned to the magic he or she chooses. If another spellcaster within 300 feet of the character uses
      this magic, the character also immediately gains the magic’s effect as if it had been used on the character by the
      same caster. The character must have direct line of effect to the spellcaster in order to gain the benefit of the
      attuned magic (though the character does not have to know the spellcaster is present, and he or she can be
      flat-footed). The magic’s duration, effect, and other specifics are determined by its original caster’s level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time a
      character takes the feat, it applies to a different spell or spell-like ability.

      as a cleric channels energy to convert spells into <i>cure</i> spells.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character takes the feat, it
      applies to a different domain.
    </p>
    <h3 id="spontaneous-spell">Spontaneous Spell <small>[Epic]</small></h3>

      spells into <i>cure</i> spells.

      <strong>Special:</strong> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or she takes the feat, it

    </p>
    <h3 id="tenacious-magic">Tenacious Magic <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Spellcraft 15 ranks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one spell the character knows or spell-like ability the character possesses.
      Whenever the chosen form of magic would otherwise end due to a <i>dispel</i> effect, the magic is instead only
      suppressed for 1d4 rounds. The magic still ends when its duration expires, but the suppressed rounds do not count
      against its duration. The character can dismiss his or her own spell or spell-like ability (if dismissible) or
      dispel his or her own tenacious magic normally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or she takes the feat, it

      stack with similar abilities.
    </p>
    <h3 id="trap-sense">Trap Sense <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Search 25 ranks, Spot 25 ranks, trapfinding class ability.</p>

      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 15, base attack bonus +9, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon Fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> If the character hits an opponent with a weapon in each hand in the same round, he or
      she may automatically rend the opponent. This deals additional damage equal to the base damage of the smaller
      weapon plus 1 1/2 times the character’s Strength modifier. Base weapon damage includes an enhancement bonus on
      damage, if any. The character can only rend once per round, regardless of how many successful attacks he or she
      makes.
    </p>
    <h3 id="uncanny-accuracy">Uncanny Accuracy <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 21, base attack bonus +11, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Improved Precise
      Shot, Spot 20 ranks.
    </p>
    <p>

      concealment. The character must aim his or her attacks at the correct square to gain advantage of this feat.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> A character with at least 11 levels of ranger can qualify for this feat even if he or
      she does not have the prerequisites for it, but can only use it when wearing light or no armor.
    </p>
    <h3 id="undead-mastery">Undead Mastery <small>[Divine][Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Cha 21, ability to rebuke or command undead.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> Any weapon the character wields is treated as an unholy weapon (it is evil-aligned and
      deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against creatures of good alignment). This ability doesn’t stack with similar
      abilities. If the weapon already has an alignment, this feat has no effect on the weapon.
    </p>
    <h3 id="vermin-wild-shape">Vermin Wild Shape <small>[Wild][Epic]</small></h3>

      Strike, Stunning Fist, <i>ki</i> strike (adamantine).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character’s unarmed strike is considered to be a slashing vorpal weapon. (At the
      character’s option, any unarmed strike can do bludgeoning damage instead, but it loses the vorpal quality.) This
      ability doesn’t stack with similar abilities
    </p>
    <h3 id="widen-aura-of-courage">Widen Aura of Courage <small>[Epic]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Cha 25, aura of courage class ability.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The character can use a rebuke or command undead attempt to animate corpses within range
      of his or her rebuke or command attempt. The character animates a total number of HD of undead equal to the number
      of undead that would be commanded by the character’s result (though the character can’t animate more undead than
      there are available corpses within range). The character can’t animate more undead with any single attempt than
      the maximum number he or she can command (including any undead already under his or her command). These undead are
      automatically under the character’s command, though his or her normal limit of commanded undead still applies. If
      the corpses are relatively fresh, the animated undead are zombies. Otherwise, they are skeletons.
    </p>
    <p>
      These feats are not epic feats, so they may be selected by character any time he or she could select a new feat.

      is a melee attack, the creature provokes no attacks of opportunity from moving out of squares threatened by its
      target.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, a creature making an attack as part of a Flyby Attack maneuver
      provokes attacks of opportunity as normal from moving out of squares threatened by its target.
    </p>
    <h3 id="improved-multiattack">Improved Multiattack<small> [General]</small></h3>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Three or more natural weapons, Multiattack</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Benefit:</strong> The creature’s secondary attacks with natural weapons have no penalty. They still add
      only one-half the creature’s Strength bonus, if any, to damage dealt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, the creature’s secondary natural attacks have a –5 penalty (or a –2

      weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> This feat replaces the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat for creatures with more than
      two arms.
