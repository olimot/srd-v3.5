      Abominations are a grouping of the outsider type in the same way that demons are a grouping of the outsider type.
      The accompanying table indicates the average values an abomination of a given size might have for its basic
      physical scores. Abominations also share several other characteristics.

    <h4 id="abomination-traits">Abomination Traits</h4>
    <p>
      All abominations are born directly (or indirectly) from a god and some lesser creature (or idea), but none are
      favored, wanted, or loved. Still, they all share a tiny spark of deific energy, which grants them the qualities
      described in below. (Note: deity rules are used, abominations are rank 0 deities.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Immunities (Ex):</strong> Abominations are immune to polymorphing, petrification, or any form-altering
      attack. They are not subject to energy drain, ability drain, or ability damage. They are immune to mind-affecting
      effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and are immune to one of five energy types
      (specific to the abomination).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Resistances (Ex):</strong> Abominations have fire resistance 20, cold resistance 20, and damage reduction
      of at least 10/epic (certain abominations have higher damage reduction). Abominations all have significant spell
      resistance. Abominations resist detection, and are all treated as if affected by a <i>nondetection</i> spell of a
      caster level equal to the abomination’s HD.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special Qualities (Ex):</strong> All abominations have the spell-like ability to use <i>true seeing</i> at
      will. Abominations are not subject to death from massive damage, and they have maximum hit points per Hit Die.
      Abominations have the blindsight extraordinary ability to a range of 500 feet. Abominations can choose both
      nonepic and epic feats as part of their feat selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Telepathy (Su):</strong> Abominations can communicate telepathically with any creature within 1,000 feet
      that has a language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Summon Creature</i> (Sp):</strong> Abominations can summon creatures associated either with the
      portfolio of their godly progenitor or with their imprisonment. Summoned creatures serve the abomination without
      question. Summoned creatures automatically return whence they came after 1 hour, or sooner if slain. See specific
      abomination entries for additional details on summoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fast Healing and Regeneration:</strong> Most abominations have some measure of fast healing and
      regeneration, ranging from 5 to 55 for both abilities. Usually, higher HD abominations have higher values for fast
      healing and regeneration, though this not always the case. If an abomination has regeneration, it is usually
      subject to normal damage from at least two sources, one of which is the antithesis for their subtype, and the
      other of which is somehow tied to some unique feature of the abomination.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Natural Armor:</strong> All abominations have some degree of natural armor bonus ranging from +10 to +100.
      Usually, higher HD abominations have higher natural armor bonuses, but this is not always the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> All abominations have access to a variety of spells in the form of
      spell-like abilities, which they can use as 20th- or higher-level casters, depending on the abomination. No rule
      governs how many or how few spell-like abilities an abomination may claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Unique Abilities:</strong> All abominations have at least one or more unique abilities tied to their godly
      parent’s portfolio, or to the manner of their incarceration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> As a general rule of thumb, abominations have spell resistance equal to their
      CR +12.
    </p>
    <p>Abominations speak Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and often a language associated with their imprisonment.</p>

      reduction.

    <h3 id="atropal--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> At will—<i

      >5/day—<i>haste, project image, weird.</i> Caster level 30th; save DC 26 + spell level.
    </p>
    <p>The save DCs are Charisma-based</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rebuke/Command Undead (Su):</strong> Atropals can rebuke or command undead as a cleric with a level equal
      to the atropal’s HD + 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Negative Energy Aura (Su):</strong> A 30-foot-radius spread negative energy aura spreads from each
      atropal. All undead in the field (including the atropal) are treated as if having turn resistance +20 and a
      negative energy version of fast healing 20. Living creatures in the aura are treated as having ten negative levels
      unless they have some sort of negative energy protection or protection from evil. Creatures with 10 or fewer HD or
      levels perish (and, at the atropal’s option, rise as spectres under the atropal’s command 1 minute later).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Constitution Drain (Su):</strong> When the atropal hits a living opponent with a touch attack, the
      opponent takes 5 points of permanent Constitution drain, or 10 points on a critical hit. The atropal heals 20
      points of damage, or 40 points on a critical hit, whenever it drains Constitution, gaining any excess as temporary
      hit points. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. The attack allows a Fortitude save (DC 59). The
      DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Energy Drain (Su):</strong> When the atropal hits with a ranged touch attack (a ray of darkness that it
      shoots from one eye to a range of 400 feet), the resultant energy drain bestows four negative levels, or eight
      negative levels on a critical hit. For each negative level bestowed on an opponent, the atropal heals 10 points of
      damage, or 20 on a critical hit, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last a
      maximum of 1 hour. After 24 hours have passed, the afflicted opponent must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 59) for
      each negative level. If successful, the negative level goes away with no harm to the creature; otherwise, the
      creature’s level decreases by one. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Regeneration (Ex):</strong> Atropals take normal damage from good weapons or sentient weapons (or
      otherwise living weapons).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Summon Nightcrawler</i> (Sp):</strong> Five times per day an atropal can summon a nightcrawler.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Abomination Traits:</strong> Immune to polymorphing, petrification, and other form-altering attacks; not
      subject to energy drain, ability drain, ability damage, or death from massive damage; immune to mind-affecting
      effects; fire resistance 20; cold resistance 20; nondetection; true seeing at will; blindsight 500 ft.; telepathy
      out to 1,000 ft.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Undead Traits:</strong> Immune to poison, <i>sleep,</i> paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects,
      necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on
      objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Negative
      energy heals. Not at risk of death from massive damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less. Darkvision 60 ft.
      Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature is willing.

      A dream larvas’s natural weapons are treated as epic, evil, and chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
      damage reduction.
    </p>
    <h3 id="dream-larva--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Worst Nightmare (Su):</strong> Each time a living creature first views a specific dream larva from a
      distance of 30 feet or less (or from a scrying effect), the subject sees the image of the most fearsome creature
      imaginable. This is not an illusion or phantasm; the dream larva truly becomes, for just that instant, the
      subject’s worst nightmare. Even if simultaneously viewed by dozens of different creatures, the dream larva appears
      differently to each one of them. Creatures immune to fear or mind-affecting effects (or warded by
      <i>protection from evil</i> or <i>death ward</i> spells) are immune to worst nightmare; all others must make a
      Will save (DC 43) or die from the supernatural horror revealed. Survivors (and those resurrected) are immune to
      the effect from that individual dream larva in the future. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> At will—<i>fly, haste, nightmare, prismatic spray;</i>
      2/day—<i>dreamscape</i>(epic spell). Caster level 31st; save DC 23 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> If the dream larva hits with a claw or pincer, it deals normal damage and
      attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Dream larvae can use
      improved grab on a creature of any size. The dream larva has the option to conduct the grapple normally, simply
      use the claw or pincer to hold the opponent, or use sending (see below) on the opponent. Each successful grapple
      check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage listed for the attack that established the
      hold, unless it used sending on the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sending (Su):</strong> Grappled victims may be physically sent into a nightmare, at the dream larva’s
      option, on the dream larva’s next action after establishing the grapple. Victims must make a Will save (DC 43) or
      be apparently swarmed by thousands of worms making up the dream larva’s body. The victim is actually cast into a
      shrieking maelstrom of dream where it can take no actions but observe. The victim physically returns 2d4 rounds
      later, apparently ejected from the dream larva’s body (but appearing even if if the dream larva has left or is
      otherwise absent). The victim of the nightmare has taken 4d6 points of temporary Wisdom damage, but is otherwise
      free to act on the round it returns. If the victim takes more Wisdom damage than it has points of Wisdom, the
      extra points are instead treated as temporary Constitution damage. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Summon Nightwalker</i> (Sp):</strong> Five times per day, a dream larva can summon a nightwalker.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Abomination Traits:</strong> Immune to polymorphing, petrification, and other form-altering attacks; not
      subject to energy drain, ability drain, ability damage, or death from massive damage; immune to mind-affecting
      effects; fire resistance 20; cold resistance 20; nondetection; true seeing at will; blindsight 500 ft.; telepathy
      out to 1,000 ft.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Regeneration (Ex):</strong> Dream larvae take normal damage from good or lawful weapons or weapons forged
      by a sleepwalking weaponsmith.

    </p>
    <h3 id="hecatoncheires--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Superior Multiweapon Fighting (Ex):</strong> A hecatoncheires fights with a greatsword or a boulder in
      each hand. The hecatoncheires does not suffer an attack or damage penalty for attacking with one hundred weapons.
      However, the press of limbs prevents the creature from making iterative attacks with any of its arms, nor can it
      make more than ten attacks against a Small or smaller creature, fifteen attacks against a Medium-size creature, or
      twenty attacks against a Large creature in the same action (it can make all its attacks against a Huge or larger
      creature in one action).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Skills:</strong> A hecatoncheires’ fifty heads give it a +50 racial bonus on Listen, Spot, and Search
      checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> At will— <i>greater magic weapon, fly, shield.</i> Caster level 50th; save
      DC 17 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Summon Hecatoncheires</i> (Sp):</strong> A hecatoncheires can summon one other hecatoncheires once per
      day, though is loath to do so because then it will be similarly obligated to answer its sibling’s summoning. A
      summoned hecatoncheires cannot use its summoning power while “summoned.”

    <p>
      <strong>Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> If an infernal hits with a claw, it deals normal damage and attempts to start
      a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Infernals can use this ability on Large and
      smaller creatures. The infernal has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its claw to hold the
      opponent. Each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals standard claw
      damage, in addition to automatic spell suck damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell Suck (Su):</strong> If an infernal bites a foe, the foe loses one of its highest-level prepared
      spells or one of the spell slots for this day that it has not used. The victim chooses the prepared spell to lose.
      If the victim has no prepared spells or unused spell slots (either because it has exhausted its spellcasting for
      the day or because the victim is not a spellcaster), the bite instead deals 2 points of temporary Intelligence
      damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Learned Spell Immunity (Su):</strong> If an infernal is affected by a spell cast by a particular
      spellcaster, the infernal thereafter becomes immune to that spell when cast by that spellcaster.

    <p>A phaethon’s natural weapons are treated as epic and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
    <h3 id="phaethon--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p><strong>Fiery Touch (Ex):</strong> Touching or being touched by a phaethon deals 2d6 points of fire damage.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fiery Overrun (Ex):</strong> A foe who is successfully overrun by a phaethon is treated as if swallowed
      whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> If the phaethon hits with a pseudopod, it deals normal damage and attempts to
      start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Phaethons can use improved grab on a
      Huge or smaller creature. The phaethon has the option to conduct the grapple normally, simply maintaining a
      pseudopod hold, or attempting to absorb the opponent by swallowing the foe whole. Each successful grapple check it
      makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage listed for the pseudopod.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Swallow Whole (Ex):</strong> The phaethon can absorb opponents it holds with a second successful grapple
      check after a grab. The opponent must be Huge or smaller. Absorbed creatures take 20d6 points of fire damage and
      10d6 points of bludgeoning damage each round they remain inside a phaethon. Victims must make a successful grapple
      check to “swim” free of the living magma of the phaethon.

      A phanes’ natural weapons are treated as epic, evil, and chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
      reduction.
    </p>
    <h3 id="phane--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> At will—<i>detect good, detect magic, improved invisibility</i>
      (self only);
      <i
        >5/day—haste, slow, greater teleport, tongues, trap the soul, true strike, unholy aura; 2/day—safe time, time
        duplicate</i
      >
      (epic spell); <i>1/day—time stop.</i> Caster level 21st; save DC 21 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Stasis Touch (Su):</strong> As <i>temporal stasis,</i> except as an at-will supernatural ability. Caster
      level 25th; save DC 21 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Chronal Blast (Su):</strong> As a standard action, the phane can make a ranged touch attack against any
      creature within 100 feet. If it succeeds, the subject is targeted by a spasm of space-time flux, dealing 15d6
      points of damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Time Leach (Su):</strong> For every round of apparent time experienced by the phane, it automatically
      absorbs the “future” from any creature it has successfully encapsulated in static time via its stasis touch (not
      its null time field), no matter the distance separating victim and phane, and no matter the number of victims. Of
      course, to the victim no time passes at all, but each apparent round experienced by the phane ages the victim 1d4
      years, at the same time healing the phane of 20 hit points of damage. A victim who is not somehow released from
      static time by a friend who can cast <i>dispel magic, greater dispel magic,</i> or some other likely spell,
      eventually ages to death. Victims killed in this manner automatically fall out of static time as desiccated husks
      that disintegrate to a fine dust with even the lightest touch. Victims who are released prior to death immediately
      apply the physical effects of aging, but not the mental effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Summon Past Time Duplicate</i> (Sp):</strong> Once per day, a phane can summon a duplicate of one its
      foes stolen from a parallel alternate past. The stolen <i>time duplicate</i> has the same stats and possessions as
      the original, but is treated as if having two negative levels (which simulates a less experienced version of the
      original). The phane can never summon a past <i>time duplicate</i> of a creature with more than 25 HD (add
      sufficient negative levels to compensate for high foe HD, if necessary). The past <i>time duplicate,</i>despite
      having most of the knowledge of the original, serves the phane loyally like any summoned creature. If the past
      <i>time duplicate</i> is slain, the original is not harmed because the duplicate was pulled from a parallel past.
      However, the original does not necessarily realize this, and must make a Will save (DC 30) or be shaken for 1d4
      rounds after witnessing the death of a duplicate for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Abomination Traits:</strong> Immune to polymorphing, petrification, and other form-altering attacks; not
      subject to energy drain, ability drain, ability damage, or death from massive damage; immune to mind-affecting
      effects; fire resistance 20; cold resistance 20; nondetection; true seeing at will; blindsight 500 ft.; telepathy
      out to 1,000 ft.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Null Time Field (Ex):</strong> Phanes continually generate a 30-foot-radius spread null time field. All
      creatures and objects in the field, except the phane, must make a Will saving throw (DC 30) each round to take any
      actions. On a failed save, subjects are stuck in a static time stream until their next round of actions, at which
      time they must make another saving throw. While a subject is stuck in a static time stream induced by a null time
      field, the phane can use its static touch on the subject, though in all other ways, the subject is invulnerable to
      attacks and damage as if in temporal stasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Time Regression (Su):</strong> If the phane spends an action per round for four rounds, at the end of the
      4th round the phane regresses back in time 4 rounds, to the very 1st round it originally began concentrating on
      time regression. On its second pass through the time stream, it can take completely different actions, based on
      its knowledge of the future (though if it takes different actions from its first pass through the time stream, the
      events of the original time stream are also changed).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Regeneration (Ex):</strong> Phanes take normal damage from holy and good weapons, and from weapons forged
      in the future or an alternate reality’s time stream (if any).

      A xixecal’s natural weapons are treated as epic, evil, and chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
      reduction.
    </p>
    <h3 id="xixecal--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Rend (Ex):</strong> If the xixecal hits with both claw attacks, it latches onto the opponent’s body and
      tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 4d8+42 points of damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cold (Su):</strong> A hit from a xixecal’s melee attack induces numbing cold. The opponent must succeed at
      a Fortitude save (DC 58) or be affected as though by a <i>slow</i> spell for 10 rounds. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> At will—<i
        >blasphemy, cone of cold, desecrate, greater dispel magic, dominate monster, hold person, greater invisibility,
        unholy aura, wall of ice;</i
      >5/day—<i>haste, meteor swarm.</i> Caster level 36th; save DC 22 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Breath Weapon (Su):</strong> Cone of cold, 300 feet, 3/day, damage 12d6, Fort half DC 61. The DC is
      Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Summon White Dragon</i> (Sp):</strong> Five times per day a xixecal can summon an old white dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Constitution Drain (Su):</strong> This effect permanently reduces a living opponent’s Constitution score
      by 4 when the creature hits with a slam, bite, or rend, or twice that amount on a rend or critical hit. The
      creature heals 20 points of damage (or 40 on a rend or critical hit) whenever it drains Constitution, gaining any
      excess as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. The attack allows a Fortitude
      save (DC 58). The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Abomination Traits:</strong> Immune to polymorphing, petrification, and other form-altering attacks; not
      subject to energy drain, ability drain, ability damage, or death from massive damage; immune to mind-affecting
      effects; nondetection; true seeing at will; blindsight 500 ft.; telepathy out to 1,000 ft.
    </p>
    <p>The standard fire resistance 20 most abominations have is not shared by xixecales</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dire Winter (Su):</strong> A xixecal always stands at the center of a permanent <i>dire winter</i> (epic
      spell)spell effect. If dispelled, the effect returns 1 minute later— the only way to permanently remove the effect
      is to slay the xixecal that generates it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Regeneration(Ex):</strong> Xixecals take normal damage from Lawful weapons, and double damage from burning
      or fiery weapons.

    <p>
      <strong>Frightful Howl (Su):</strong> As a standard action, a brachyurus can emit a howl in a 60-foot-radius
      spread that affects opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the brachyurus has. The affected creature must
      make a successful Will save (DC 33) or become shaken. Success indicates that the target is immune to that
      brachyurus’s frightful howl for one day. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Savage (Ex):</strong> If a brachyurus successfully trips an opponent, it latches onto the opponent’s body
      and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 15d6+25 points of damage. If an opponent goes
      prone for any reason in an area a brachyurus threatens, the brachyurus can also savage the victim as a free action
      (treat as the brachyurus’s attack of opportunity for the round), even though it had nothing to do with tripping
      the foe.
    </p>
    <h2 id="colossus">Colossus</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Construct Traits:</strong> Immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and
      morale effects), and to poison, <i>sleep,</i> paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects,
      and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Cannot heal damage (though
      regeneration and fast healing still apply, if present). Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability
      damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Not at risk of death from massive damage, but destroyed when reduced to 0
      hit points or less; cannot be raised or resurrected. Darkvision 60 ft.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Magic Immunity (Ex):</strong> A colossus completely resists most magical and supernatural effects, except
      where otherwise noted below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Antimagic Field (Ex):</strong> A colossus constantly generates an antimagic field in a 100-foot-radius.
      The field is an invisible barrier that is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like
      abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within
      its confines, except for the colossus’s own supernatural abilities. This effect is otherwise as an
      <i>antimagic</i> field cast by a 25th-level caster.
    </p>
    <p>A colossus’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
    <h3 id="colossus--construction">Construction</h3>
    <p>
      The construction cost given for each colossus takes into account the physical body and all the materials and spell
      components that are consumed or become a permanent part of it. Except for the much tougher requirements,
      constructing a colossus is not unlike constructing a golem.

    <p>A stone colossus cannot speak or make any vocal noise.</p>
    <h4 id="stone-colossus--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Shatter (Su):</strong> A stone colossus can use <i>shatter</i>(DC 7)as a free action once every 2 rounds
      against an opponent’s weapon or other item as a 24th-level caster. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Magic Immunity (Ex):</strong> A stone colossus is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and
      supernatural effects, except as follows. A <i>transmute rock to mud</i> spell slows it (as the <i>slow</i> spell)
      for 1 round, with no saving throw, while <i>transmute mud to rock</i> heals all its lost hit points. A
      <i>stone to flesh</i> spell has no effect on a stone colossus.
    </p>
    <h4 id="stone-colossus--construction">Construction</h4>
    <p>
      A stone colossus’s body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone, such as granite, weighing at least 375,000
      pounds. The colossus costs 760,000 gp to create, which includes 100,000 gp for the body. Assembling the body
      requires a successful Craft (sculpting) or Craft (masonry) check (DC 37). The creator must be 25th level and able
      to cast epic spells. Completing the ritual drains 30,600 XP from the creator and requires
      <i>geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object,</i> and <i>shatter.</i>
    </p>
    <h3 id="flesh-colossus">Flesh Colossus</h3>
    <p>
      A flesh colossus knows all languages spoken in life by the ghost who acts as its control-ling spirit. When the
      controlling spirit is suppressed, it mutters in all the tongues spoken by its component corpses.
    </p>
    <h4 id="flesh-colossus--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Frightful Presence (Ex):</strong> All who come within a mile of the flesh colossus must make Will saves
      (DC 55). Those who make their saves are shaken. Those who fail by 20 points or less are frightened. Those who fail
      by 21 to 40 points are panicked. Those who fail by 41 points or more are cowering. The DC is Charisma-based.

      <strong>Horrific Appearance (Su):</strong> Once per day, the controlling spirit within a flesh colossus may draw
      upon the negative energy latent in the construct to transform its countenance into a horrible leering visage: All
      within 300 feet who see this must make a Fortitude save (DC 55) or take 2d4 points of temporary Strength,
      Dexterity, and Constitution damage. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Stomp (Ex):</strong> As a full-round action, a flesh colossus may stomp upon any adjacent foe (that is,
      any within the area it threatens). Its attack roll modifier for this special attack is +65 (+75 base, –2 Dex, –8
      size). If successful, the stomp deals double damage (8d6 +24) and pins the victim until the colossus chooses to
      release him or her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Stench (Ex):</strong> All creatures with a sense of smell who come within 300 feet of the construct must
      make a Fortitude save (DC 60) or be nauseated (unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do
      anything else requiring attention, except for a single move or move-equivalent action per round). Those who
      succeed on their saves take a –4 circumstance penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for the
      next 2d6+4 minutes. The DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Magic Immunity (Ex):</strong> A flesh colossus is immune to all magical and supernatural effects except
      those that use negative energy (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Negative Energy Affinity (Su):</strong> Any negative energy spell targeted at the colossus repairs damage
      taken by the colossus at the rate of 1d10 hit points per level of the spell.
    </p>
    <h4 id="flesh-colossus--construction">Construction</h4>
    <p>
      Only a master necromancer of surpassing power can create a flesh colossus. The bodies of not less than three
      hundred previously animated Medium-size humanoid creatures must be stripped of their flesh and the bones, which
      are then rendered in two great vats. The resulting semiliquid bone-paste is then cast into a new articulated
      skeleton of great size, to which the rendered flesh is applied like wet clay to shape the figure. Finally, the
      necromancer must bind a ghost of at least 10 HD (the more powerful the better) into the colossus to act as its
      controlling spirit. Without the controlling spirit, the colossus is just an oversized zombie; with it, it
      functions as a golem of great size and repugnant appearance. If no ghost is available, the necromancer may occupy
      the colossus himself by casting
      <i>magic jar</i>. The colossus costs 760,000 gp to create, which includes 100,000 gp for the body. Assembling the
      body takes no great skill, and many flesh colossi reveal that fact in their uncouth forms. The creator must be
      29th level and able to cast epic spells. Completing the ritual drains 30,600 XP from the creator and requires
      <i>magic jar, limited wish, polymorph any object,</i> and <i>finger of death</i>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="iron-colossus">Iron Colossus</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Breath Weapon (Su):</strong> Cone of poisonous gas, 80 feet, as a free action every 1d4 rounds, initial
      damage 3d6 temporary Con, secondary damage 2d6 temporary Con, Fort half (DC 58). The DC is Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Magic Immunity (Ex):</strong> An iron colossus is immune to all magical and supernatural effects, except
      as follows. An electricity effect restores 1 hit point to the iron colossus for each 3 points of damage it would
      otherwise deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rustproof (Ex):</strong> An iron colossus is not affected by rust attacks, unlike smaller iron golems.
    </p>
    <h4 id="iron-colossus--construction">Construction</h4>
    <p>
      An iron colossus’s body is sculpted from 150,000 pounds of pure iron. The colossus costs 1,000,000 gp to create,
      which includes 100,500 gp for the body. Assembling the body requires a successful Craft (armorsmithing) or Craft
      (weaponsmithing) check (DC 42). The creator must be 35th level and able to cast epic spells. Completing the ritual
      drains 50,000 XP from the creator and requires <i>cloudkill, geas/quest, limited wish,</i> and
      <i>polymorph any object.</i>

    <p>Demiliches speak the languages they knew as liches and as living creatures.</p>
    <p>A demilich’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
    <h3 id="demilich--combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Trap the Soul (Su):</strong> A demilich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use
      this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The target is allowed a Fortitude saving throw (DC
      36). If the target makes its saving throw, it gains four negative levels (this does not count as a use of trap the
      soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is instantly drawn from its body and trapped within
      one of the gems incorporated into the demilich’s form. The gem gleams for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul
      within. The soulless body collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If
      left to its own devices, the demilich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours—at the end of that time the soul is
      completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone. If the demilich is overcome before the soul is eaten,
      crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body
      by the use of either <i>resurrection,</i> <i>true resurrection, clone,</i> or <i>miracle.</i> A potential victim
      protected by a <i>death ward</i> spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude
      saving throw andis effective against the level loss on a successful save. The DC is Charisma-based
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fear Aura (Su):</strong> Demiliches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures of less
      than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the demilich must succeed at a Will save (DC 19) or be affected as
      though by <i>fear</i> as cast by a 21st-level caster. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Paralyzing Touch (Su):</strong> Any living creature a demilich touches must succeed at a Fortitude save
      (DC 36) or be permanently paralyzed. <i>Remove paralysis</i> or any spell that can remove a curse can free the
      victim. The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a demilich seems dead, though a successful Spot check
      (DC 20) or Heal check (DC 15) reveals that the victim is still alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells:</strong> The demilich can cast any spells it could cast as a lich. This sample demilich was a
      21st-level wizard (spells per day: 4/12/8/7/7/7/7/6/6/6/3). The last three spell slots are 10th-level slots and
      available for 0–9th level metamagic spells.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Perfect Automatic Still Spell (Ex):</strong> A demilich can cast all the spells it knows without gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> At will—<i
        >alter self, astral projection, create greater undead, create undead, death knell, enervation, greater dispel
        magic, harm</i
      >
      (usually used to heal itself ),
      <i>summon monster I–IX, telekinesis, weird;</i> 2/day—<i>greater planar ally.</i>
      Demiliches use these abilities as casters of a level equal to their spellcaster level, but the save DCs are all
      36. The DC is Charisma-based.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Magic Immunity (Ex):</strong> Demiliches are immune to all magical and supernatural effects, except as
      follows. A <i>shatter</i> spell affects a demilich as if it were a crystalline creature, but deals half the damage
      normally indicated. A <i>dispel evil</i> spell deals 3d6 points of damage (Fort save for half damage).
      <i>Holy smite</i> spells affect demiliches normally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Phylactery Transference (Su):</strong> Headbands, belts, rings, cloaks, and other wearable items kept in
      close association with the demilich’s phylactery transfer all their benefits to the demilich no matter how far
      apart the demilich and the phylactery are located. The standard limits on types of items utilized simultaneously
      still apply. The sample demilich “wears”
      <i>bracers of armor +8, headband of intellect +6, pink Ioun stone, ring of wizardry</i>
      I, <i>ring of protection +2,</i> and <i>gloves of Dexterity +2.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Undead Traits:</strong> Immune to poison, <i>sleep,</i> paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects,
      necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on
      objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Negative
      energy heals. Not at risk of death from massive dam-age, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less. Darkvision 60 ft.
      Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature is willing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Immunities (Ex):</strong> Demiliches are immune to cold, electricity, polymorph, and mind-affecting
      attacks.

    <h3 id="creating-a-demilich">Creating a Demilich</h3>
    <p>
      “Demilich” is a tem-plate that can be added to any lich. It uses all the lich’s statistics and special abilities
      except as noted here. A demilich’s form is concentrated into a single portion of its original body, usually its
      skull. Part of the process of becoming a demilich includes the incorporation of costly gems into the retained body
      part; see Creating Soul Gems, below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Size: Medium-size and Large liches become Diminutive demiliches, Huge liches become Small demiliches, Gargantuan
      liches become Medium-size demiliches, and Colossal liches become Large demiliches.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> As lich.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Speed:</strong> Replace with fly 180 ft. (perfect) or the lich’s supernatural (not natural) fly speed,
      whichever is better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>AC:</strong> The demilich retains the lich’s +5 natural armor bonus and gains an insight bonus equal to AC
      equal to its Hit Dice, as well as a probable size adjustment to AC.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Attack:</strong> The demilich gains an insight bonus equal to its Hit Dice as a bonus on its touch
      attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Damage:</strong> The demilich gains an enhanced touch attack over that of its previous lich form (it now
      uses its entire flying skull to make the touch attack), including paralyzing touch. The demilich’s touch attack
      uses negative energy to deal 10d6+20 points of damage to living creatures (no saving throw). Liches with other
      natural attacks lose them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special Attacks:</strong> The demilich retains all the lich’s special attacks and also gains those
      described below.
    </p>

      <strong><i>Trap the Soul (Su):</i></strong
      >A demilich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To use this power, it selects any target

    <p>
      <strong><i>Fear Aura (Su):</i> </strong>Demiliches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures of
      less than 5 HD in a 60- foot radius that look at the demilich must succeed at a Will save (DC 14 + demilich’s Cha
      modifier) or be affected as though by <i>fear</i> as cast by a 21st-level caster.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Paralyzing Touch (Su):</i> </strong>Any living creature a demilich touches must succeed at a Fortitude
      save (DC 10 + demilich’s HD + demilich’s Cha modifier) or be permanently paralyzed. <i>Remove paralysis</i> or any

      seems dead, though a successful Spot check (DC 20) or Heal check (DC 15) reveals that the victim is still alive.
    </p>
    <p>Spells: The demilich can cast any spells it could cast as a lich.</p>
    <p><em>Perfect Automatic Still Spell:</em> The demilich can cast all the spells it knows without gestures.</p>

    <p>
      The process of becoming a demilich can be undertaken only by a lich acting of its own free will. The demilich
      retains all class abilities it had as a lich.
    </p>
    <h3 id="creating-soul-gems">Creating Soul Gems</h3>
    <p>
      Liches have phylacteries that allow them to reappear 1d10 days after their apparent death, as do demiliches.
      Demiliches also have eight soul gems, each of which acts like a phylactery in its own right. If all the soul gems,
      as well as the demilich’s phylactery, are not destroyed after a demilich is downed, the demilich reappears 1d10
      days after its apparent death. The soul gems also allow the demilich to use its most devastating ability, trap the
      soul (see above). Each demilich must make its own soul gems, which requires the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The lich
      must be a sorcerer, wizard, or cleric of at least 21st level. Each soul gem costs 120,000 gp and 4,800 XP to
      create and has a caster level equal to that of its creator at the time of creation. Soul gems appear as egg-shaped
      gems of wondrous quality. They are always incorporated directly into the concentrated form of the demilich.

    <p><strong>Poison (Ex):</strong> Bite, Fort save (DC 93); initial and secondary damage 2d12 temporary Dex.</p>

      <strong>Web (Ex):</strong> A single web strand is strong enough to support the spider and one creature of
      Gargantuan size. Web-spinning devastation spiders can cast a web eight times per day. This is similar to an attack
      with a net but has a maximum range of 150 feet, with a range increment of 30 feet, and is effective against
      targets of up to Gargantuan size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement. An entangled creature
      can escape with a successful Escape Artist check (DC 38) or burst it with a Strength check (DC 44). Both are
      standard actions. Web-spinning spiders often create sheets of sticky webbing about 1,000 feet square. They usually
      position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures
      must succeed at a Spot check (DC 20) to notice a web; otherwise, they stumble into it and become trapped as though
      by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has
      something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section has 24 hit points, and sheet webs have damage
      reduction 20/fire. A devastation spider can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed and can determine the
      exact location of any creature caught in the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Skills:</strong> Web-spinning devastation spiders receive a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Spot checks.
      Hunting spiders receive a +6 racial bonus on Jump checks and a +8 racial bonus on Spot checks (using the modifiers
      given in parentheses). *All devastation spiders gain a +8 competence bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks when
      using their webs.

    <p>
      <strong>Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> To use this ability, the devastation scorpion must hit with its claw attack.
      If it gets a hold, it hangs on and squeezes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Squeeze (Ex):</strong> A devastation scorpion that gets a hold on a Gargantuan or smaller opponent
      automatically deals damage with both claws and its sting.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Poison (Ex):</strong> Sting, Fort save (DC 95); initial and secondary damage 2d12 temporary Str.</p>
    <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Devastation scorpions receive a +4 racial bonus on Climb, Hide, and Spot checks.</p>
    <h3 id="devastation-beetle">Devastation Beetle</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Trample (Ex):</strong> A devastation beetle can trample Gargantuan and smaller creatures for 30d10+24
      points of damage. Opponents who do not make attacks of opportunity against the devastation beetle can attempt a
      Reflex save (DC 90) to halve the damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Acid Cloud (Ex):</strong> A devastation beetle exudes a constant vapor that radiates outward in every
      direction for 60 feet. This vapor deals 6d6 points of acid damage each round to anyone caught in the cloud.

    <h2 id="dragon-advanced">Dragon, Advanced</h2>
    <p>
      The standard advancement rules allow dragons theoretically infinite progression even beyond the stage of great
      wyrm. The following rules let dragons improve more than their Hit Dice as they progress to epic heights of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Age Category:</strong> A standard dragon gains one “virtual age category” for every 3 Hit Dice it gains
      beyond the great wyrm stage. Abilities that function once per day per age category or otherwise use the dragon’s
      age category as part of a calculation use this adjusted number. Epic dragons gain one age category per 5 Hit Dice
      beyond great wyrm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Size:</strong> One important element of dragon advancement is increasing size. The dragons that don’t
      reach Colossal size by the great wyrm stage can never reach it according to the standard advancement rules. When
      advancing a dragon, consider its basic size group: lesser (white, black, brass, and copper dragons), ordinary
      (green, blue, and bronze dragons), greater (silver, red, and gold), or epic (force and prismatic). A dragon that
      is Tiny as a wyrmling is in the lesser group, a dragon that is Small as a wyrmling and never reaches Colossal size
      is in the ordinary group, and a dragon that is Small to Large as a wyrmling and reaches Colossal by the great wyrm
      stage is in the greater group. A lesser dragon becomes Colossal when it gains two age categories (6 Hit Dice)
      beyond great wyrm. It increases to Colossal+ when it gains an additional four age categories (12 HD). An ordinary
      dragon becomes Colossal when it gains one age category (3 Hit Dice) beyond great wyrm. It increases to Colossal+
      when it gains an additional four age categories (12 HD). A greater dragon becomes Colossal+ when it gains four age
      categories (12 HD) more than it needed to reach the Colossal size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Epic dragons, already Colossal+ by the time they reach the great wyrm stage, do not increase in size thereafter.
      Use the information presented under the epic dragon entry, below, to determine the statistics of a Colossal+
      dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Armor Class:</strong> A dragon’s natural armor bonus increases by +1 for every Hit Die it gains beyond the
      great wyrm stage. (This rule applies for lesser dragon advancement as well, since natural armor and Hit Dice
      always increase at the same rate.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Breath Weapon:</strong> If a dragon’s breath weapon deals damage, the damage typically increases by 2 dice
      for every virtual age category the dragon gains. The two exceptions among standard dragonsare the brass and white
      dragons, whose breath weapon damage increases by only 1 die per age category. The saving throw DC against a
      dragon’s breath weapon remains 10 + 1/2 the dragon’s Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> For standard advanced dragons, spell resistance increases by 2 per additional
      age category. For epic dragons, spell resistance increases by 3 (for force dragons) or 6 (for prismatic dragons)
      per additional age category.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Speed:</strong> When a dragon becomes Colossal, its fly speed increases by 50 feet and its maneuverability
      becomes clumsy. When it reaches Colossal+, its fly speed increases by another 50 feet, and its maneuverability
      remains clumsy. A dragon’s land speed and other special movement types (swim, burrow, and so on) do not change.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Scores:</strong> A great wyrm’s Strength and Constitution scores both increase by +2 for every
      virtual age category the dragon gains. Its Dexterity remains unchanged. Its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
      increase by +2 for every two age categories the dragon gains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Dragons do not gain additional spell-like abilities, but their damage
      reduction continues to increase as they gain Hit Dice. For most dragons (the exceptions being the force and
      prismatic dragons), the great wyrm’s damage reduction increases to 15/epic after exceeding the great wyrm age
      category and the dragon’s natural weapons count as epic weapons for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Force and prismatic dragons have the following DR progression: wyrmling 10/magic, young 15/magic, young adult
      15/epic, mature adult 20/epic, very old 25/epic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> A great wyrm’s caster level increases by 2 for every virtual age category the dragon gains.
      As with the epic dragons described later, advanced dragons gain the Improved Spell Capacity feat as a bonus feat
      once for every three caster levels above 20th.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Feats:</strong> Like ordinary dragons, advanced dragons receive one feat for every 3 Hit Dice they have.
      Feats gained after the dragon attains great wyrm status can be epic feats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> For standard dragons, CR increases by 2 per additional age category. For epic
      dragons, CR increases by 3 per additional age category. All other dragon statistics are as presented for dragons
      in general and specific dragon varieties.

      Epic dragons share all the combat characteristics of standard dragons. Even wyrmling epic dragons are Huge,
      however, and are capable of making tail sweep and crush attacks. Although there is no size category larger than
      Colossal, the oldest epic dragons deal more damage with their attacks than other Colossal dragons, as shown on the
      Epic Dragon Face and Reach and Epic Dragon Attacks tables below. In addition, the breath weapon of the oldest epic
      dragons is a larger cone than most Colossal dragons possess. The size modifier for these dragons remains –8.

      Wyrmling epic dragons possess certain abilities that common dragons do not acquire until later in life, including
      frightful presence, spellcasting, and spell resistance. An epic dragon with a caster level above 20th gains the
      Improved Spell Capacity feat as a bonus feat once for every three caster levels above 20th. Any epic dragon can
      choose epic feats for which it otherwise meets the prerequisites. Epic dragons also have access to dragon feats,
      as well as the additional feats described in this book.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Empower Spell-Like Ability:</strong> An epic dragon can apply the Empower Spell feat to one of its
      spell-like abilities that it can use at least twice per day. If the dragon has limited use of the spell-like
      ability, the empowered ability uses up two uses of the ability. If the dragon can use the ability at will, there
      is no cost for empowering the ability. The dragon does not need to specify a spell-like ability when it chooses
      this feat; it can apply the feat to any spell-like ability it possesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Maximize Spell-Like Ability:</strong> The dragon can apply the Maximize Spell feat to one of its
      spell-like abilities that it can use at least three times per day. If the dragon has limited use of the spell-like
      ability, the maximized ability uses up three uses of the ability. If the dragon can use the ability at will, there
      is no cost for maximizing the ability. The dragon does not need to specify a spell-like ability when it chooses
      this feat; it can apply the feat to any spell-like ability it possesses.
    </p>
    <p>Epic dragons fly even faster than common dragons, and can cover greater distances.</p>

      A force dragon’s natural weapons are treated as magic (wyrmling – juvenile) or epic (young adult – great wyrm) for
      the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <h4 id="force-dragon-epic--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Breath Weapon (Su):</strong> A force dragon has one type of breath weapon, a cone of force that tears
      through creatures and objects in its area to devastating effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Immune to Force (Ex):</strong> A force dragon cannot be harmed by any force effect, including
      <i>magic missiles, explosive runes, mage’s sword,</i> the <i>sphere</i> spells, or any other spell or effect with
      the Force descriptor. It can move freely through barriers made of force, such as a
      <i>wall of force.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Deflecting Force (Su):</strong> A force dragon is protected by a shield of force that provides a
      deflection bonus to its AC. The deflection bonus is equal to the dragon’s Charisma bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Blur (Su):</strong> When a force dragon reaches juvenile age, the force surrounding its body distorts the
      light around it so that it is hard to discern the dragon’s exact location. This functions as a continuous
      <i>blur</i> spell, giving the dragon concealment (20% miss chance).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Displacement (Su):</strong> An old force dragon’s deflecting force bends light even more ex-tremely,
      giving the dragon the benefit of the <i>displacement</i> spell (50% miss chance). This supersedes its
      <i>blur</i> ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Invisibility (Su):</strong> A great wyrm force dragon is a creature of pure force, and is completely
      invisible (as though protected by <i>greater invisibility).</i>A creature that can see invisible creatures must
      still contend with the dragon’s <i>displacement</i> ability.

    <h3 id="primal-air-elemental">Primal Air Elemental</h3>
    <p>Primal air elementals speak Auran.</p>
    <h4 id="primal-air-elemental-primal--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Air Mastery (Ex):</strong> Airborne creatures take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against an air
      elemental.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Whirlwind (Su):</strong> The elemental can transform itself into a whirlwind once every 10 minutes and
      remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has. In this form, the elemental can move through the air
      or along a surface at its fly speed. A primal air whirlwind is 10 feet wide at the base, 40 feet wide at the top,
      and up to 80 feet tall. The elemental controls its exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet. Gargantuan or
      smaller creatures might take damage when caught in the whirlwind and may be lifted into the air. An affected
      creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 53) when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take 4d8 points of
      damage. It must also succeed at a second Reflex save (DC 53) or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the
      powerful winds, automatically taking 4d8 points of damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex
      save (DC 53) each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is
      successful. The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the
      whirlwind happens to be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane.
      If the whirlwind’s base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the
      elemental and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including
      darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have one-half concealment, while those farther away have total
      concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 53) to cast a spell. The DC is
      Strength-based.

    <h3 id="primal-earth-elemental">Primal Earth Elemental</h3>
    <p>Earth elementals speak Terran.</p>
    <h4 id="primal-earth-elemental-primal--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Earth Mastery (Ex):</strong> An earth elemental gains a +1 attack and damage bonus if both it and its foe
      touch the ground. If an opponent is airborne or water-borne, the elemental takes a –4 penalty on attack and damage
      rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Push (Ex):</strong> An earth elemental can start a bull rush maneuver without provoking an attack of
      opportunity. The combat modifiers given for earth mastery, above, also apply to the elemental’s opposed Strength
      checks.
    </p>
    <h3 id="primal-fire-elemental">Primal Fire Elemental</h3>
    <p>
      A primal fire elemental cannot enter water or any other nonflammable liquid. Unlike lesser fire elementals, a
      primal fire elemental may attempt to evaporate a lesser body of water if blocked. Fire elementals speak Ignan.
    </p>
    <h4 id="primal-fire-elemental-primal--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Burn (Ex):</strong> Those hit by a primal fire elemental’s slam attack must succeed at a Reflex save (DC
      51) or catch fire. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds. A burning creature can take a move-equivalent action to put out
      the flame. Creatures hitting a fire elemental with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take fire damage as though
      hit by the elemental’s attack, and also catch fire unless they succeed at a Reflex save. The DC is
      Constitution-based.
    </p>
    <h3 id="primal-water-elemental">Primal Water Elemental</h3>
    <p>
      A primal water elemental can’t venture more than 360 feet from the body of water from which it emerged. Water
      elementals speak Aquan.
    </p>
    <h4 id="primal-water-elemental--combat">Combat</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Water Mastery (Ex):</strong> A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and
      its opponent touch water. If the opponent or elemental is land-bound, the elemental takes a –4 penalty on attack
      and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.) A primal water elemental can be a
      serious threat to a ship that crosses its path. It can easily overturn even large craft (ships of up to 5 feet in
      length per Hit Dice of the elemental) and stop massive vessels (ships of less than 10 feet in length per HD). Even
      ocean-going behemoths (ships of less than 20 feet in length per HD) can be slowed to half speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Drench (Ex):</strong> The elemental’s touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open
      flames of non-magical origin if these are Gargantuan or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches
      as <i>dispel magic</i> cast by a caster whose level equals the elemental’s HD total (64).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Vortex (Su):</strong> The elemental can transform itself into a whirlpool once every 10 minutes, provided
      it is underwater, and remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has (48 rounds). In vortex form, the
      elemental can move through the water or along the bottom at its swim speed. The vortex is 5 feet wide at the base,
      up to 50 feet wide at the top, and up to 80 feet tall. The elemental controls its exact height, but it must be at
      least 10 feet. Gargantuan and smaller creatures might take damage when caught in the vortex and may be swept up by
      it. An affected creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 58) when it comes into contact with the vortex or take
      4d10 points of damage. It must also succeed at a second Reflex save (DC 68) or be picked up bodily and held
      suspended in the powerful currents, automatically taking 4d10 points of damage each round. A creature that can
      swim is allowed a Reflex save (DC 58) each round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can
      leave if the save is successful. The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them
      wherever the vortex hap-pens to be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its
      home plane. If the vortex’s base touches the bottom, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered
      on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the vortex’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including
      dark-vision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have one-half concealment, while those farther away have total
      concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 58) to cast a spell. The DC is
      Strength-based.
