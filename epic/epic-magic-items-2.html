    <h1>EPIC MAGIC ITEMS 2</h1>

    <h2 id="scrolls">Scrolls</h2>
    <p>
      To generate an epic scroll randomly, first roll on Table: Scroll Types to determine whether the spells are arcane
      or divine. An epic scroll contains 1d8 spells. For each spell, roll on Table: Epic Scroll Spell Levels to
      determine its level and then on the appropriate section of Table: Actual Spell Levels to determine the spell’s
      actual level and total metamagic level adjustments. To determine the specific metamagic level adjustments, roll on
      the appropriate section of Table: Metamagic Level Adjustment to Spells. To determine the spell, use the
      appropriate sections of the nonepic scroll tables.

      grants its wielder fire resistance 30 whenever held. In addition, it has the following powers.

    <ul>
      <li><i>Wall of fire</i> (extended, 1 charge, DC 18)</li>
      <li><i>Delayed blast fireball</i> (intensified to 240 points of damage, 2 charges, DC 22)</li>

        <i>Summon monster IX</i> (extended, 2 charges, elder fire elemental only) A <i>staff of fiery power</i> can be
        broken in a retributive strike. The breaking of the staff must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All
        charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot- radius globe. All within 10 feet of the
        broken staff take points of damage equal to eight times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11
        feet and 20 feet away take six times the number of charges in damage, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take
        four times the number of charges in damage. Successful Reflex saving throws (DC 17) reduce the damage sustained
        by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence; if he or
        she does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him or her. After all charges are used up from the
        staff, it remains a +<i>5 quarterstaff</i>
        with no special abilities. (Once empty of charges, it cannot be broken in a retributive strike.)

    <h2 id="intelligent-items">Intelligent Items</h2>
    <p>
      Just like nonepic magic items, epic magic items sometimes possess intelligence of their own. Such items are fully
      sentient and should be treated as NPCs. The Random Epic Magic Items section details the chances that epic armor,
      shields, rings, rods, staffs, wondrous items, and weapons might be intelligent. In short, a ring, rod, staff,
      wondrous item, armor, or shield has a 1% chance to be intelligent, a ranged weapon has a 5% chance to be
      intelligent, and a melee weapon has a 15% chance to be intelligent. Rather than using the tables for nonepic
      items, use the tables below to determine the properties of an intelligent item: the number of powers, unusual
      properties, alignment, and special purpose of the item (if any). Of the three mental ability scores, two scores
      are favored (2d6 + some number) and one is completely random (3d6). Choose which scores get assigned which number,
      or roll 1d4 and determine randomly according to the following table.

    <p>
      To find the market price for an epic magic item, use these expanded guidelines, adjusting as necessary to find an
      appropriate final price. Each point of Intelligence bonus, Wisdom bonus, or Charisma bonus increases the item’s
      market price by 400 gp. Any form of communication possessed by the item increases its market price by the number
      shown on Table: Epic Item Communication. Each primary ability possessed by the item increases its market price by
      2,000 to 10,000 gp (average 6,000 gp). Each extraordinary ability possessed by the item increases its market price
      by 15,000 to 35,000 gp (average 25,000 gp). A special purpose increases the item’s market price by 50,000 gp. An
      awesome power increases the item’s market price by 100,000 gp.
    </p>
    <h3 id="intelligent-items--intelligent-item-alignment">Intelligent Item Alignment</h3>
    <p>
      Any item with Intelligence has an alignment. Make sure that the alignment choosen or determine randomly (using
      Table: Item Alignment) matches any alignment-oriented special abilities of the item. Any character whose alignment
      is not compatible with that of the item gains one negative level for every 10 points of the weapon’s Ego (see Item
      Ego, below) if he or she so much as picks up the item. Although this never results in actual level loss, the
      negative levels remain as long as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including
      <i>restoration</i> spells). These negative levels are cumulative with any other penalties the item might already
      place on inappropriate wielders.

    <p>
      If the same ability is rolled twice or more, the range, frequency, or effectiveness of the power is doubled,
      tripled, and so on. All abilities function only when the item is held, drawn, or otherwise brandished and the
      possessor is concentrating on the desired result. Activating a power is a standard action, but using a free feat
      is not. Feats may be used regardless of prerequisites, but the item still must be held and drawn (or worn, in the
      case of such items). An intelligent item might activate a power on its own.

      Unless otherwise stated, all awesome powers function at 20th caster level. If a power is rolled twice, the uses
      per day are doubled. Powers function only when the item is drawn and held, and the possessor is concentrating upon
      the desired effect. Activating a power is a standard action. An intelligent item might activate a power on its
      own.

    <h3 id="intelligent-items--items-against-characters">Items Against Characters</h3>
    <p>
      When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is, of course, absolutely true to its
      alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment’s goals or the item’s special
      purpose, personality conflict—item against character—results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or
      higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does
      not always agree with the item. When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw
      (DC = item’s Ego). If the possessor succeeds, he or she is dominant. If he or she fails, the item is dominant.
      Dominance lasts for one day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to
      either item or character, and so on). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character’s desires and
      demands concessions such as any of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.</li>
      <li>The character divesting him or herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.</li>
      <li>Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.</li>
      <li>Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.</li>
      <li>Magical protections and devices to protect the item from molestation when it is not in use.</li>
      <li>That the character carry the item with him or her on all occasions.</li>
      <li>
        That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or
        conduct.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Force its possessor into combat.</li>
      <li>Refuse to strike opponents.</li>
      <li>Strike at its wielder or his or her associates.</li>
      <li>Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.</li>
      <li>Cause itself to drop from the character’s grasp.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character’s and item’s alignments or when
      their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess
      it in order to easily command him or her, or a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals. All
      magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way, particularly
      combat. Such items are rivals of each other, even if they are of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to
      share its wielder with others. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within
      60 feet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract their host so that he or she ignores or
      destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might change this sort of behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters who possess them, even though
      they may never successfully control their possessor. They may be powerless to force their demands but remain
      undaunted and continue to air their wishes and demands.

      No character can gain any effect from an additional roll of the dice within 24 hours, with two exceptions. If a 2
      is rolled, the dice automatically roll themselves at the beginning of the character’s next turn and he or she must
      accept the additional result. If a 12 is rolled, the character may choose to roll again in the next round (if more
      than 1 full round elapses between the roll of 12 and this bonus roll, the character loses the bonus roll). There
      is no method (mundane or magical) to predict or influence the result of a roll of <i>Rogue’s dice.</i>Even
      powerful divination magic can’t predict the outcome of a roll before it is made.

      2 points of temporary Charisma damage; these points cannot be healed or restored in any way while the
      <i>Axe</i> is held. The current owner of the <i>Axe</i> gains a +10 bonus on Craft (armorsmithing, blacksmithing,
      gemcutting, stonemasonry, and weaponsmithing) checks. The wielder of the <i>Axe</i> can summon an elder earth
      elemental (as <i>summon monster IX;</i> duration 20 rounds) once per week.

      <strong id="major-artifacts--codex-of-the-infinite-planes">Codex of the Infinite Planes:</strong> The
      <i>Codex</i> is enormous—supposedly, it requires two strong men to lift it. No matter how many pages are turned,
      another always remains. Anyone opening the <i>Codex</i> for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a
      <i>destruction</i> spell (Fortitude DC 30 for only 10d6 damage). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn
      its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the <i>Codex</i> allows the reader to make a
      Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance
      bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also
      forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the
      <i>insanity</i> spell). The powers of the <i>Codex of the Infinite Planes</i> are as follows:
      <i
        >astral projection, banishment, elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar binding, plane
        shift,</i
      >
      and <i>soul bind.</i> Each is usable at will by the owner of the <i>Codex</i> (assuming that he or she has learned
      how to access the power). The <i>Codex of the Infinite Planes</i> has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of
      all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires both a
      Concentration check and a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can’t take
      10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below
      for the effect). A character can only incur one catastrophe per power use, even if he or she fails both checks.

      <i>Cup</i> is a large gem-set golden chalice requiring two hands to lift. It emits light (as the
      <i>daylight</i> spell) at all times and automatically dispels any darkness-based spells whose area it enters. If
      the cup is filled with holy water (requiring a full gallon), that substance will act as a
      <i>potion of cure critical wounds</i> or a <i>potion of neutralize poison</i> (owner’s choice) if drunk. This
      liquid can’t be saved or stored in any way. The <i>Talisman</i> is a small eight-pointed platinum star hanging
      from a chain of gold and pearls. The wearer gains a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma and may cast
      <i>remove blindness/deafness, remove curse,</i> and <i>remove disease</i> at will. Furthermore, if the
      <i>Talisman</i> is placed within the <i>Cup</i> and the <i>Cup</i> filled with holy water, that liquid acts as a
      special elixir of <i>resurrection</i> (as the spell). This effect will function only once per month. Any evil or
      chaotic creature that touches the <i>Cup</i> or <i>Talisman</i> is struck with a <i>holy word</i> (if evil) or
      <i>dictum</i> (if chaotic) spell (or both if the creature is chaotic evil).

      enhancement bonus to Strength and Charisma, and the orc’s darkvision range is doubled. Nonorcs who possess the
      <i>Eye</i> gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength but take a –2 penalty to Intelligence and Charisma. Regardless
      of the owner’s race, any weapon wielded by the owner of the <i>Eye</i> is considered an
      <i>elf bane weapon.</i>Furthermore, by holding the <i>Eye</i> before the character, he or she can perceive things
      as if he or she had <i>true seeing</i> cast upon him or her. This can be activated only once per day but lasts as
      long as the character concentrates on it (requiring a standard action each round).

      not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.
      <i>Golem Armor</i> is immune to rust attacks. The wearer of <i>Golem Armor</i> gains damage reduction

      keep followers or cohorts who are good or chaotic. Once per day, the wielder can use <i>implosion</i> as a

      The wearer of the <i>Ring</i> can, with a great deal of mental exertion, attempt to change the active facet away
      from one he or she does not desire. This requires a full-round action and a Concentration check (DC 50), and deals
      2d6 points of nonlethal damage regardless of success. If the save is successful, the new facet is determined
      randomly. If the <i>Ring</i> is removed, the former wearer takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage each minute until
      it is replaced or until his or her nonlethal damage exceeds his or her current hit points (though the nonlethal
      damage resumes again immediately when the former wearer regains consciousness).
