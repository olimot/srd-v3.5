    <h1>EPIC MAGIC ITEMS 1</h1>
    <p>
      While not truly an artifact, the epic magic item is a creation of such power that it surpasses other magic items.
      Epic magic items are objects of great power and value. The following are typical characteristics of an epic magic
      item. In general, an item with even one of these characteristics is an epic magic item.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Grants a bonus on attacks or damage greater than +5.</li>
      <li>Grants an enhancement bonus to armor higher than +5.</li>
      <li>Has a special ability with a market price modifier greater than +5.</li>
      <li>Grants an armor bonus of greater than +10 (not including magic armor’s enhancement bonus).</li>
      <li>Grants a natural armor, deflection, or resistance bonus greater than +5.</li>
      <li>Grants an enhancement bonus to an ability score greater than +6.</li>
      <li>Grants an enhancement bonus on a skill check greater than +30.</li>
      <li>Mimics a spell of an effective level higher than 9th.</li>
      <li>Has a caster level above 20th.</li>
      <li>
        Has a market price above 200,000 gp, not including material costs for armor or weapons, material component- or
        experience point-based costs, or additional value for intelligent items.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An epic magic item that grants a bonus beyond those allowed for normal magic itemshas a higher market price than
      indicated by the formulas for non-epic items.
    </p>
    <p>
      Epic magic items are not artifacts. They are not unique, though they are certainly very rare, and anyone with the
      proper item creation feats can build them. Even an epic magic item can never grant a dodge bonus, and the maximum
      inherent bonus that can be applied to an ability score is +5. An epic magic item cannot be created that uses or
      mimics an epic spell. A major artifact might be able to mimic such a spell, however.

    <h2 id="creating-epic-magic-items">Creating Epic Magic Items</h2>
    <p>
      The process of creating an epic magic item is very similar to creating a nonepic magic item. However, certain
      important differences exist.
    </p>
    <h2 id="caster-level">Caster Level</h2>
    <p>
      Spells with an effective level of 10th or higher are possible at epic levels. Because these spell slots aren’t
      automatically gained at a particular level like 0- to 9th-level spells are, they don’t have a minimum caster
      level. For this reason, the minimum caster level for any spell of 10th level or higher is set at 11 + spell level.
    </p>
    <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to the materials and tools required for nonepic magic items, any epic magic item requires at least two
      item creation feats: the epic and nonepic version.
    </p>
    <h2 id="market-price">Market Price</h2>
    <p>
      Use the guidelines for nonepic magic itemsto determine the market price of an epic magic item, with one addition:
      If the item gives a bonus beyond the limit allowed in for normal, nonepic magic items, multiply the portion of the
      market price derived from that characteristic by 10. Some epic characteristics, such as caster level, don’t
      trigger this multiplier.
    </p>
    <h3 id="experience-point-cost">Experience Point Cost</h3>
    <p>
      The experience point cost to create an epic magic item is determined differently than for a normal magic item. For
      all epic magic items other than scrolls, divide the market price by 100, then add 10,000 XP to the result. The
      final number is the experience point cost to create the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      For epic scrolls, divide the market price by 25 (as normal for creating a nonepic scroll), then add 1,000 XP to
      the result. The final number is the experience point cost to create the epic scroll.
    </p>
    <h3 id="magic-item-descriptions">Magic Item Descriptions</h3>
    <p>
      In the following sections, each general type of magic item, such as armor or scrolls, has an overall description,
      followed by descriptions of specific items, if any. Each magic item description and table follows the same format
      used for nonepic magic items. Specific exceptions are noted as necessary.
    </p>
    <h2 id="armor">Armor</h2>
    <p>
      Except when otherwise stated, epic magic armor and shields follow the rules for nonepic magic armor and shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no limit to the enhancement bonus of epic magic armor or shields, to the market price modifier of epic
      magic armor or shield special abilities, or to the total enhancement bonus and market price modifier of epic magic
      armor or shields.
    </p>
    <h3 id="epic-armor-and-shield-base-price">Epic Armor and Shield Base Price</h3>
    <p>
      To find the base price of an epic suit of magic armor or an epic magic shield, roll on Table: Armor and Shields.
      Note that the +6 to +10 rows apply only to armor and shields that provide an enhancement bonus of +6 to +10 or
      armor and shields with a single special ability whose market price modifier is +6 to +10. Magic armor and shields
      with a total effective bonus of +6 to +10 but that have an enhancement bonus of +5 or less and special abilities
      whose individual market price modifiers are +5 or less use the table for nonepic magic armorto determine price.

    <p>
      Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have special abilities, such as
      those detailed below and nonepic abilities. Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least a +1
      enhancement bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Acid Warding:</strong> The armor absorbs the first 50 points of acid damage per round that the wearer
      would normally take (similar to the <i>resist energy</i> spell).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>protection from energy; Market Price:</i> +6 bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cold Warding:</strong> The armor absorbs the first 50 points of cold damage per round that the wearer
      would normally take (similar to the <i>resist energy</i> spell).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>protection from energy; Market Price:</i> +6 bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Exceptional Arrow Deflection:</strong> This shield functions like a
      <i>shield of arrow deflection</i> except that it can deflect any type of ranged attack (including spells that
      require a ranged touch attack) as if it were an arrow. Any time the bearer would normally be struck by a ranged
      attack, he or she can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20). If the ranged attack has an enhancement bonus (or a
      spell level), the DC increases by that amount. If he or she succeeds, the shield deflects the attack. The bearer
      must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged attack doesn’t count as an action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 23rd; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>shield, wall of force; Market Price: +</i>8 bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fire Warding:</strong> The armor absorbs the first 50 points of fire damage per round that the wearer
      would normally take (similar to the <i>resist energy</i> spell).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>protection from energy; Market Price: +</i>6 bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Great Invulnerability:</strong> This suit of armor or shield grants the wearer damage reduction. The
      damage reduction can be 10/magic, 15/magic, 5/epic, or 10/epic, depending on the armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 19th (10/magic), 20th (15/magic), 21st (5/epic), 22nd (10/epic);
      <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, <i>stoneskin, wish,</i> or
      <i>miracle; Market Price:+</i>4 bonus (10/magic),+5 bonus (15/magic),+6 bonus (5/epic),+7 bonus (10/epic).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Great Reflection:</strong> Any time its bearer of this shield is targeted with a spell, it automatically
      reflects the spell back at the caster (as the <i>spell turning</i> spell). The wearer can lower or raise this
      effect as a free action (thus allowing beneficial spells in as desired).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 25th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>spell turning; Market Price: +</i>10 bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Great Spell Resistance:</strong> This suit of armor or shield grants the wearer spell resistance. The
      spell resistance can be 21, 23, 25, or 27, depending on the armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 21st (SR 21), 22nd (SR 23), 23rd (SR 25), 24th (SR 27); <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magic
      Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, <i>spell resistance; Market Price: +</i>6 bonus (SR 21), +7 bonus
      (SR 23), +8 bonus (SR 25), +9 bonus (SR 27).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Infinite Arrow Deflection:</strong> This shield functions like a <i>shield of arrow deflection</i>, though
      it can deflect any number of projectiles or thrown weapons each round. Any time the bearer would normally be
      struck by a ranged weapon, he or she can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20). If the ranged weapon has an
      enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he or she succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. The
      bearer must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn’t count as an
      action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or ranged spells, can’t be deflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>protection from arrows, shield; Market Price: +</i>6 bonus.
    </p>

      <em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <i>Prereq-uisites:</i> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>protection from energy; Market Price: +</i>6 bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Negating:</strong> Immediately after the wearer of this armor is hit with a magic weapon, the armor casts
      <i>greater dispelling</i> on the weapon. (In the case of projectile weapons, the armor casts
      <i>greater dispelling</i> on the weapon that fired the projectile if it is in range. If it is out of range, the
      armor does nothing.) No weapon can be affected by the armor more than once per day (regardless of the success of
      the dispel check).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 20th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>greater dispelling; Market Price: +</i>5 bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sonic Warding:</strong> The armor absorbs the first 50 points of sonic damage per round that the wearer
      would normally take (similar to the <i>resist energy</i> spell).

      <strong>Armor of the Abyssal Horde:</strong> This+<i>6 full plate armor’s</i> clawed gauntlets are effectively +4
      keen weapons (1d10/19–20) that afflict the target as if she had been struck by an <i>energy drain</i> spell
      (Fortitude negates DC 23). The armor bestows two negative levels on any nonevil creature wearing it. These
      negative levels persist as long as the armor is worn and disappear when the armor is removed. The negative levels
      never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including <i>restoration</i> spells)
      while the armor is worn.

      <strong>Bulwark of the Great Dragon:</strong> This +<i>6 heavy shield</i> bears the image of a dragon’s head.
      Three times per day, the bearer of the shield can command it to belch forth a breath weapon of the appropriate

    <p>
      Most magic weapons only have enhancement bonuses. They can also have special abilities, such as those detailed
      below and nonepic abilities.A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Acidic Blast:</strong> On command, an acidic blast weapon drips acid (though this deals no damage to the
      wielder). On any hit, this acid splashes the creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus acid damage. On a
      successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of acid damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or
      +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus
      acid damage upon their ammunition.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>acid fog; Market Price: +</i>6 bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Anarchic Power:</strong> This weapon is chaos-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage
      reduction. When a weapon of anarchic power strikes a lawful target, this power deals +3d6 points of bonus chaotic
      damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a
      successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of chaotic damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6
      and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical
      multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. These
      negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These
      negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including
      <i>restoration</i> spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability
      bestow the anarchic power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic anarchic
      special ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>word of chaos; Market Price: +</i>8 bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Axiomatic Power:</strong> This weapon is lawful-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damager
      reduction. When a weapon of axiomatic power strikes a chaotic target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6
      points of bonus lawful damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24
      hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of lawful damage and bestows two negative
      levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if
      the critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any chaotic creature attempting to
      wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer
      wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way
      (including <i>restoration</i> spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special
      ability bestow the lawful power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic
      axiomatic special ability.

      <strong>Distant Shot:</strong> A distant shot weapon can be used against any target within line of sight at no
      penalty for range.

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dread:</strong> A dread weapon excels at attacking one type of creature. Against its designated foe, its
      effective enhancement bonus is +4 better than its normal enhancement bonus. Further, it deals +4d6 points of bonus
      damage against the foe, and if it scores a successful critical hit against the foe, that creature must make a
      Fortitude save (DC 27) or be destroyed instantly and turned to dust. (This even affects creatures immune to
      critical hits or death magic.) To randomly determine a dread weapon’s designated foe, roll on the following table.

      <strong>Everdancing:</strong> An everdancing weapon is much like a dancing weapon, though it can be loosed with a
      free action and will fight as long as desired. It can move up to 60 feet away from its owner. Its owner can
      instruct it to move to a different target as a move-equivalent action. If its owner is rendered unconscious or
      otherwise unable to direct it, it will fight the same opponent as long as that opponent is conscious and within
      range. The owner of an everdancing weapon can grasp it again as a free action (assuming it is within reach).

      <strong>Fiery Blast:</strong> On command, a fiery blast weapon is sheathed in fire (though this deals no damage to

      successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of fire damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or

      <strong>Holy Power:</strong> This weapon is good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damager reduction.
      When a weapon of holy power strikes an evil target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus holy
      (good) damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later).
      On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of holy (good) damage and bestows two negative levels
      (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the
      critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any evil creature attempting to wield it.
      These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded.
      These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including
      <i>restoration</i> spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability

      On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of cold damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is

      points of bonus electricity damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of electricity
      damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and

      damage to the wielder). On any hit, this becomes a thunderous roar that deals +3d6 points of bonus sonic damage to
      the creature struck. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of sonic damage (or +9d6 if the
      critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this
      special ability bestow the bonus sonic damage upon their ammunition.

      <strong>Triple-Throw:</strong> This special ability can only be placed on a weapon that can be thrown. (If this
      property is rolled for a weapon that cannot be thrown, reroll.) A triple-throw weapon creates two duplicates of
      itself when thrown. Both the original and the duplicate weapons attack separately (at the same attack bonus).
      Regardless of the success of any of the attacks, the duplicates immediately disappear after the attack is
      completed. Any bonuses on damage due to accuracy or precision (including those from sneak attacks, the Precise
      Shot feat, or the ranger’s favored enemy bonus) apply only to the original weapon’s damage, not to the duplicates.

      <strong>Unerring Accuracy:</strong> Ranged attacks made with this weapon negate the AC bonus granted by any cover
      short of total cover. The weapon’s ranged attacks also ignore any miss chance from concealment (including total
      concealment, but the must still aim his or her attacks at the correct square).

      <strong>Unholy Power:</strong> This weapon is evil-aligned and this bypasses the corresponding damage reduction.
      When a weapon of unholy power strikes a good target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus unholy
      (evil) damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later).
      On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of unholy (evil) damage and bestows two negative levels
      (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the
      critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any good creature attempting to wield it.
      These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded.
      These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including
      <i>restoration</i> spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability
      bestow the unholy power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic unholy special
      ability.

      <strong>Virtuous Good:</strong> The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in a <i>holy aura</i> effect. It
      bestows one negative level on any evil creature that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring is
      worn and disappears when the ring is removed. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it
      cannot be over-come in any way (including <i>restoration</i> spells) while the ring is worn.

      <strong>Epic Psionics:</strong> This special crystal ring comes in a variety of types useful only to psionic
      characters (characters who have power points per day). The wearer’s total power points per day are increased,
      depending on the ring. The points granted are not bonus points—while the ring is worn, it actually increases the
      wearer’s points per day, but a night’s rest is required before gaining access to the increased power point per day
      total. (Power points are not actually stored in the ring, as would be the case for a crystal capacitor. Instead,
      the ring grants power points by magnifying the manifester’s own power.)

    <h3 id="epic-rod-descriptions">Epic Rod Descriptions</h3>
    <p>Standard epic rods are described below.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Besiegement:</strong> This rod functions as a +<i>3 light mace.</i> In addition, it is useful for
      besieging fortifications. Whenever the wielder makes a charge attack, the rod improves to a +6 weapon. Twice per
      day, the rod can create a battering ram that lasts for 24 rounds. This ram can strike once per round, dealing 20
      points of damage with each hit. It cannot be used to target individuals, only fortifications. It can be damaged by
      normal means (65 hp, AC 22), and <i>disintegrate</i> or <i>dispel magic</i> destroys it. The rod also has the
      following powers: <i>Siege Engine:</i> One heavy catapult, two light catapults, or three siege towers may be
      generated with each use of this power. Each weapon created lasts for 12 hours. The power can be used three times
      per day. Ammunition for 20 shots is included with each weapon created.
    </p>
    <p><em>Transmute Rock to Mud:</em> This power can be used three times per day (caster level 24th, save DC 17).</p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 24th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor,
      <i>clenched fist, passwall, telepathic bond, transmute rock to mud; Market Price:</i>
      447,745 gp; <i>Cost to Create:</i> 224,025 gp + 14,474 XP.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Epic Absorption:</strong> Like a <i>rod of absorption,</i> this rod draws single-target or ray spells and
      spell-like abilities into itself, nullifying the effect and storing the potential spell levels until the wielder
      releases the energy in the form of spells of his or her own. Spells of any level (including those boosted beyond
      9th level by metamagic) can be absorbed, although epic spells cannot. The rod absorbs a maximum of 150 spell
      levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 23rd; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Empower Spell, Maximize Spell,
      empowered maximized <i>spell turning; Market Price:</i> 1,500,000 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Epic Cancellation:</strong> This rod’s touch drains an item of all magical properties, including the
      magical energy in epic magic items (but not most artifacts). The item touched gets a Will saving throw (DC 26). If
      a creature is holding the magic item at the time, then the item can use the holder’s Will save bonus in place of
      its own. In such cases, contact is established by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining three items, the
      rod becomes brittle and useless. Drained items can only be restored by <i>wish, miracle,</i> or epic spells
      specifically designed to restore lost power. A <i>rod of epic cancellation</i> can neutralize a normal
      <i>sphere of annihilation</i> without itself being cancelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 25th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod,
      <i>dispel magic; Market Price:</i> 330,000 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Epic Might:</strong> This rod is similar to a <i>rod of lordly might,</i> although it is far more
      powerful. It is larger than its normal counterpart, and it is constructed of adamantine rather than normal metal.
      It has six buttons, several spell-like functions, and several mundane uses, and it can also be used as a magic
      weapon of various sorts.
    </p>
    <p>The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Dominate Person:</i> Touched foe is recipient of a <i>dominate person</i> spell, if the wielder so commands
        (Will save DC 24). The wielder must choose to use this power and then succeed with a melee touch attack to
        activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Stun:</i> Upon command, all enemies viewing the rod are stunned, as per the <i>power word, stun</i> spell
        (10-foot maximum range, Will save DC 24). Invoking this power is a standard action.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Damage:</i> Upon command, the rod deals 10d8 points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack and
        cures the wielder of a like amount of damage (Will save DC 26). The wielder must choose to use this power before
        attacking, as with <i>dominate person.</i>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following weapon uses of the rod have no limits on their use.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +<i>6 heavy mace.</i></li>
      <li>When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +<i>3 longsword of fiery blasting.</i></li>
      <li>When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +<i>8 battleaxe.</i></li>
      <li>When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +<i>10 shortspear</i> or +<i>10 longspear.</i></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following mundane uses of the rod also have no limits on their use.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Climbing pole/ladder: When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in granite is extruded from the ball,
        while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 150 feet in a single
        round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot
        apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 10,000 pounds.
        The wielder can retract the pole by pushing button 5.
      </li>
      <li>
        The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod’s base 30 feet or less from the
        portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength bonus of +24.
      </li>
      <li>
        When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder a knowledge of his or her
        approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Epic Negation:</strong> This rod negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of magic items,
      including epic magic items (but not artifacts). The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a beam shoots
      forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray negates any currently active
      item function and has a 75% chance to negate any other spell or spell-like functions of that device, regardless of
      the level or power of the functions, for 2d4 rounds. To negate instantaneous effects, the rod wielder needs to
      have readied an action. The target item gets no saving throw or means to resist this effect. The rod can function
      three times per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 24th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, <i>dispel magic, limited wish</i> or
      <i>miracle; Market Price:</i> 446,000 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Epic Rulership:</strong> This rod appears to be a royal scepter worth at least 25,000 gp in materials and
      work-manship alone. The wielder can command the obedience and fealty of creatures within 360 feet when he or she
      activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 900 Hit Dice can be ruled, but creatures with
      Intelligence scores of 17 or higher are entitled to a Will saving throw (DC 29) to negate the effect. Ruled
      creatures obey the wielder as if he or she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command
      that is contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is broken. The rod can be used for 1,500
      total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration need not be continuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 25th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Improved Heighten Spell, improved
      heightened <i>mass charm; Market Price:</i> 575,000 gp; <i>Cost to Create:</i> 300,000 gp + 15,500 XP.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Epic Spellcaster:</strong> This magnificent adamantine rod grants its wielder a +10 insight bonus on
      Spellcraft checks made to cast epic spells for as long as he or she holds or carries the rod.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod; <i>Market Price:</i> 245,400 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Epic Splendor:</strong> This rod grants its wielder a +8 enhancement bonus to Charisma for as long as he
      or she holds or carries the item. Three times per day, the rod creates and garbs him or her in clothing of the
      finest fabrics, plus adornments of fur and jewels. Apparel created by the rod can remain in existence up to 24
      hours. The value of the garb ranges from 70,000 to 100,000 gp (1d4+6 x10,000 gp)—10,000 gp for the fabric, 50,000
      gp for the furs, and the rest for jewel trim (maximum of 40 gems, maximum value 1,000 gp each). In addition, the
      rod can, once per week, create a palatial mansion in any floor plan the user desires. The mansion is palatial,
      able to accommodate up to 250 people, housing them in private chambers and serving them fine banquets. The mansion
      lasts for three days, after which time it, and everything originally in it (including items removed from the
      mansion), disappear.
    </p>

      <em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod,

      XP.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Excellent Magic:</strong> Once per day when casting a nonepic or epic spell that has an experience point
      component, the rod supplies up to 2,000 XP, not the caster. If more experience points are required to cast the
      spell, the caster provides them. As a special use of the rod, the caster can substitute the power inherent in the
      rod for the experience point development cost of an epic spell. Doing so drains all the power from the rod,
      rendering it useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod; <i>Market Price:</i> 650,000 gp;
      <i>Cost to Create:</i> 325,000 gp + 26,000 XP.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fortification:</strong> This rod functions as a +<i>3 light mace.</i> In addition, it is useful for the
      construction and defense of fortifications. Whenever the wielder is benefiting from cover, the rod improves that
      to nine-tenths cover (+10 cover AC bonus and +4 cover Reflex save bonus; failure on the save results in half
      damage and success results in no damage). Three times per day, the rod can create food and water, as per the
      cleric spell, for twenty-four people. The rod also has the following powers: <i>Fortify:</i> Four times per day, a
      stone wall can be created that is 12 inches thick, 10 feet high, and 30 feet long. This wall has a parapet and
      battlements across the top. (Alternatively, the power can be used to mend a broken existing wall. The gap to be
      filled can be no more than 300 square feet in area.) In addition, once per day, a great door of iron can be
      created that is set into one of the newly created walls. This door, 4 inches thick, may be a double door, a

      catapults, or three ballistae may be generated with each use of this power. The power can be used four times per
      day. Ammunition for 20 shots is included with each weapon created.

      <strong>Nightmares:</strong> Anyone who comes within 20 feet of the wielder of this rod feels a grave sense of
      unease. Each person so affected must make a Will save (DC 17) or suffer the effects of a <i>nightmare</i> spell
      the next time he or she falls asleep. The wielder is immune to this effect. Three times per day, the wielder can
      utter a command word that causes the rod to emit a horrid, inhuman scream. Up to twenty of the closest creatures
      within a 30-foot radius who hear this terrible wail believe that their worst nightmares have become reality and
      suffer the effects of a <i>wail of the banshee</i> spell (DC 23).

      <strong>Paradise:</strong> This item creates a nondimensional space, similar in effect to a
      <i>rod of security.</i>However, the rod’s possessor and up to 999 other creatures can stay in complete safety for
      up to 1,000 days divided by the number of creatures affected. Natural healing takes place at five times the normal
      pace. The rod functions like its nonepic counterpart in all other ways.

      <strong>The Path:</strong> This rod serves as an aid to trailblazing and travel. It grants the wielder a +30
      enhancement bonus on Wilderness Lore checks for tracking and Intuit Direction checks. The handle of the rod is
      hollow, functioning like a telescope. When the wielder peers through it, the limits of vision are three times
      normal (and spotting distances for encounters are tripled). In addition, the telescoping handle enables the
      wielder to view things as though affected by a <i>true seeing</i> spell. The rod also has the following powers.
      <i>Map:</i> Three times per day a section of the rod unrolls like a scroll from a tube, revealing a map of the
      surrounding area, centered on the location of the rod. The area shown on the map covers an area as small as 50
      feet in radius to as large as 24 miles in radius, zooming in or out with a set of command words. The map reveals
      natural topography and all types of structures (even hidden ones), but it will not show the location of creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Passage:</em> Three times per day, this power allows the wielder and up to five others in a 20-foot radius to
      move unhindered through natural plant growth or bodies of water (as per the <i>freedom of movement</i> spell).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Bridge:</em> Once per day, this power allows the user to create a 5-foot-wide, 40-foot-long stone cause-way
      across chasms and canyons. The bridge created lasts for 1 hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Pass without Trace:</em> Once per day, this power can be used on the wielder and twenty others, for 21
      minutes. It is otherwise as the spell of the same name (caster level 24th).

      <strong>Restless Death:</strong> The holder of this rod can rebuke or control undead as if he or she were four
      levels higher. (The rod doesn’t grant the ability to rebuke or control undead if the holder doesn’t already have
      it.) In addition, the wielder may speak a command word to cast <i>animate dead</i>. Any skeletons or zombies
      animated by the rod’s power are automatically controlled by the rod, up to the rod’s maximum limit of 42 HD, and
      they follow the orders of the rod’s wielder. These undead don’t count toward the wielder’s limit of controlled
      undead. Finally, the wielder can speak a second command word to cast <i>slay living</i> (heightened to 10th level;
      DC 25).

    <p>
      <strong>Wyrm:</strong> Any of the various rods in this series functions as a +<i>5 quarterstaff.</i> Upon casting
      the rod to the ground (a standard action) and uttering a command word, the rod grows into a specific type of
      dragon (depending on the specific type of rod) by the end of the round. The dragon created is a wyrm and obeys the
      commands of the owner. The dragon returns to rod form (a full-round action) whenever the wielder desires, or
      whenever it moves farther than 500 feet from the owner. If the dragon form is slain, it returns to rod form and
      cannot be activated again for three days. A <i>wyrm rod</i> only functions if the possessor is of the same
      alignment as the dragon type.
