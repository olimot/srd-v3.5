    <h1>EPIC SKILLS</h1>
    <p>
      Despite the near-magical nature of some epic level skill uses, all uses of skills are considered exceptional
      abilities (except if noted otherwise), and thus function normally even within areas of antimagic.

    <h2 id="skill-synergy">Skill Synergy</h2>
    <p>
      Many skills are noted as granting a synergy bonus to the use of another skill when a character has 5 or more ranks
      in the first skill. This synergy bonus increases by +2 for every additional 20 ranks the character has in the
      skill.

    <p>
      <strong>Detect Magic:</strong> The character can sense if an item has a magical aura. He or she can then use
      Spellcraft to learn more about the item as if he or she had already cast <i>detect magic</i> on the item. This
      requires a full-round action.

      The character can implant a nonmagical suggestion in a target, display a false alignment, or disguise his or her
      surface thoughts.

        </tr>

          <td>100</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      <strong>Instill Suggestion in Target:</strong> This is identical to the effect of the <i>suggestion</i> spell,
      except that it is nonmagical and lasts for only 10 minutes. It can be sensed as if it were an enchantment effect
      (Sense Motive DC 25).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Display False Alignment:</strong> The character can fool alignment-sensing effects by displaying a false
      alignment of his or her choice. Once set, a false alignment remains as long as the character remains conscious and
      awake. Setting or changing a false alignment requires a full-round action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Disguise Surface Thoughts:</strong> The character can fool spells such as <i>detect thoughts</i> (or
      similar effects) by displaying false surface thoughts. While the character can’t completely mask the presence of
      his or her thoughts, he or she can change his or her apparent Intelligence score (and thus the character’s
      apparent mental strength) by as much as 10 points and can place any thought in his or her “surface thoughts” to be
      read by such spells or effects. If a character attempts to use Sense Motive to detect his or her surface thoughts
      (see the Sense Motive skill description), this becomes an opposed check (though any result lower than 100
      automatically fails).
    </p>
    <h2 id="climb">Climb</h2>
    <p>The character can climb otherwise unclimbable surfaces.</p>

          <td>A perfectly smooth, flat, overhang or ceiling</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      <strong>Rapid Climbing:</strong> A character can climb his or her speed as a move-equivalent action, or double his
      or her speed as a full-round action (requiring two Climb checks), but the character takes a –20 penalty on his or
      her check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Special: The Legendary Climber feat allows a character to ignore any penalties for accelerated or rapid climbing.
    </p>
    <h2 id="concentration">Concentration</h2>
    <p>The character can cast spells with somatic components even while grappled.</p>

    <h2 id="epic-skills--craft">Craft</h2>
    <p>The character can craft items more quickly than normal.</p>
    <table data-debug="no-caption" class="half-width-table">

          <th>Task</th>

          <td>+10 or more to DC</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      <strong>Quick Creation:</strong> A character can voluntarily increase the DC of crafting an item by any multiple
      of 10. This allows the character to create an item more quickly (since he or she will be multiplying this higher
      DC by his or her skill check result to determine progress). The character must decide the increase to the DC
      before making the check.

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      <strong>Create Augmented Alchemical Item or Substance:</strong> This requires the Augmented Alchemy feat, and
      allows a character to create alchemical items and substances of greater power than normal. To augment an
      alchemical substance, add +20 to the DC required to create the item and multiply the cost by 5. If the item or
      substance deals damage, double the damage dealt. If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage, double the duration
      of its effect. If the item or substance doesn’t deal damage and doesn’t have a specific listed duration (or has an
      instantaneous duration), double all dimensions of its area. If the item or substance doesn’t fit any of these
      categories, then it cannot be improved in this manner. A character can create an item with multiple degrees of
      augmentation. For every additional multiplier applied to damage, duration, or area, add an additional +20 to the
      DC and add an additional 5 to the cost multiplier.

      <strong>Fanatic:</strong> The attitude of fanatic is added here. In addition to the obvious effects, any NPC whose
      attitude is fanatic gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution scores, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves,
      and a –1 penalty to AC whenever fighting for the character or his or her cause. This attitude will remain for one
      day plus one day per point of the character’s Charisma bonus, at which point the NPC’s attitude will revert to its
      original attitude (or indifferent, if no attitude is specified).
    </p>
    <p>
      Treat the fanatic attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment effect for purposes of immunity, save bonuses, or being
      detected by the Sense Motive skill. Since it is nonmagical, it can’t be dispelled; however, any effect that
      suppresses or counters mind-affecting effects will affect it normally. A fanatic NPC’s attitude can’t be further
      adjusted by the use of skills.

      <strong>Extremely Tight Space:</strong> This is the DC for getting through a space when one’s head shouldn’t even
      be able to fit; this can be as small as 2 inches square for Medium-size creatures. Halve this limit for each size
      category less than Medium-size; double it for each size category greater than Medium-size. If the space is long,
      such as in a chimney, multiple checks may be called for.

      <strong>Pass through <i>Wall of Force</i>:</strong> This allows a character to find a gap of weakness in a

      A character can accelerate the process of teaching or training a creature, reducing the time required to the

      reduce the required time to less than 1 minute.

      he or she had provided long-term care for a full day (2 or 3 hit points per level, based on activity). The
      character can quicken the recovery of up to six patients at a time. No character’s recovery can be quickened more

      another adjacent creature whose size is no more than one category larger than the character’s own. Modifiers to
      the check for the size of the creature still apply, as do all other penalties, including those for moving faster
      than half speed. Likewise, a character can only hide another creature when it is not under direct observation by a
      third party. The creature the character hides remains hidden until it is spotted or it takes some other action
      that breaks its concealment, as normal.

      he or she must be able to hear its auditory component). Special: A character can use Listen to notice the presence
      of an invisible creature (generally opposed by a Move Silently check). If the character beats the DC by 20 or
      more, he or she can pinpoint the location of the invisible creature, though it still maintains total concealment

      <strong>Fanatic:</strong> The attitude of fanatic is added here. In addition to the obvious effects, any NPC whose
      attitude is fanatic gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution scores, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves,
      and a –1 penalty to AC whenever fighting for the character or his or her cause. This attitude will remain for one
      day plus one day per point of the character’s Charisma bonus, at which point the NPC’s attitude will revert to its
      original attitude (or indifferent, if no attitude is specified).
    </p>
    <p>
      Treat the fanatic attitude as a mind-affecting enchantment effect for purposes of immunity, save bonuses, or being
      detected by the Sense Motive skill. Since it is nonmagical, it can’t be dispelled; however, any effect that
      suppresses or counters mind-affecting effects will affect it normally. A fanatic NPC’s attitude can’t be further
      adjusted by the use of skills.

      <strong>Unconscious Control:</strong> As a free action, the character can attempt to control a light horse, pony,

      A character does not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.

      <strong>Attack from Cover:</strong> The character can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside his or her

    <p>
      <strong>Discern Partial Alignment:</strong> This use of the skill lets a character discern one component of a
      target’s alignment. When making the check, the character states whether he or she is trying to discern the
      law–chaos or good–evil component. A character can’t retry the check, and he or she can’t use this to discern more
      than one component of the alignment (but see below). The target must be visible and within 30 feet of the
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Discern Full Alignment:</strong> This use of the skill lets a character determine both components of a
      target’s alignment. The character can’t retry the check. The target must be visible and within 30 feet of the
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Detect Surface Thoughts:</strong> This lets a character read the surface thoughts of a single target (as
      the 3rd-round effect of the <i>detect thoughts</i> spell). There is no saving throw to resist this effect, though
      the target can use Bluff to disguise his or her surface thoughts (see the Bluff skill description), in which case
      this becomes an opposed check (any result lower than 100 automatically fails). The target must be visible and
      within 30 feet of the character.

      <strong>Identify Basic Property of Magic Item:</strong> This use of the skill requires one round of inspection,

      this on the same item more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Identify All Properties of Magic Item:</strong> This requires one minute of inspection, and reveals all

      caster level.

      <strong>Quick Identification:</strong> A character can identify a substance or potion in the field as a full-round
      action, without an alchemical lab or any cost. The character can’t retry this check (or take 20); if he or she
      fails, the character must identify the substance in an alchemical lab, as normal.

      With a successful check, the character knows the direction to the desired location. This merely points the
      character in the direction of the location; it doesn’t provide him or her with information on how to get there,
      nor does it take into account any obstacles in the path. “Very familiar” represents a place where the character
      has been very often and where he or she feels at home. “Studied carefully” represents a place the character knows
      well, either because he or she has been there often or has used other means to study the place. “Seen casually” is
      a place that the character has viewed more than once, but which he or she has not studied. “Viewed once” is a
      place that the character has seen once, possibly using magic. “Description only” is a place whose location and
      appearance the character knows through someone else’s description.

      <strong>Swim up Waterfall:</strong> This use of the skill allows a character to swim an angled or vertical
      surface, as long as he or she remains completely or mostly immersed in water. Other examples might include
      swimming up a whirlpool or an incredibly large wave.

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Climb Vertical Surface:</strong> The character can climb up to 20 feet (as part of normal move-ment) by
      jumping and bouncing off walls, trees, or similar vertical surfaces. The character must have at least two vertical
      surfaces to bounce off, and the two must be within 10 feet of each other.

    <p><strong>Ignore Falling Damage:</strong> The character can fall from any height and take no damage.</p>

      Special: A character with 25 or more ranks in Tumble gains a +5 dodge bonus when executing the fight defensively
      standard or full-round action, instead of a +2 bonus (or the +3 bonus from having 5 or more ranks). Increase this
      dodge bonus by +1 for every 10 additional ranks above 25 the character has. A character with 25 or more ranks in
      Tumble gains a +10 dodge bonus to AC when executing the total defense standard action, instead of a +4 bonus (or

    <p><strong>Quick Splicing:</strong> The character can splice two ropes together as a move-equivalent action.</p>

      <strong>Tie Unique Knot:</strong> The character can tie a knot that only he or she knows how to untie. This
      doesn’t affect any Escape Artist checks made to escape these bindings.

    <p>
      <strong>Animate Held Rope:</strong> The character can command any rope he or she holds as if it had the
      <i>animate rope</i> spell cast upon it (except that using the skill in this way doesn’t grant any bonus on Use
      Rope checks made with the animated rope). Each command requires a separate Use Rope check. Because the effect
      isn’t magical, it can’t be dispelled.

            When poisoned, the character can make an Autohypnosis check on his or her next action. A successful check

            If a failed saving throw indicates the character is affected by any mind-affecting powers, spells, or
            spell-like effects, a successful Autohypnosis check allows an immediate second saving throw to resist the
            effect. If the mind-affecting effect normally does not allow a saving throw, a successful Autohypnosis check

      <strong>Learn Scryer:</strong> If you determine that you’re being scried upon, you can learn the identity of the
      scryer with a DC 30 caster level check. If successful, you learn the name, race, and location of the scryer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Return Scrying:</strong> If you determine that you’re being scried upon, you can look back through the
      sensor at the scryer with a DC 50 caster level check. This allows you to spy on the scrying being as if you had
      cast a <i>scrying</i> spell upon that person. This return scrying can be detected by your target as normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Break Scrying:</strong> If you determine that you’re being scried, you can make an opposed caster level
      check with the scryer. (Your caster level must be at least 21st to attempt this task.) If you are successful, the
      scrying ends, and the scryer may not target you with a Divination (Scrying) spell or effect for a number of hours
      equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).
