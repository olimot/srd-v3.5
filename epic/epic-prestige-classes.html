    <p>
      These are classes that characters cannot pursue until they have already become epic characters in some other
      fashion. Characters add levels of epic prestige classes using the same rules as when multiclassing into a new
      character class at epic levels. As with other epic classes, a character can take as many levels in an epic
      prestige class as he or she desires.

    <h3 id="agent-retriever--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>The following are class features of the agent retriever prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> An agent retriever gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or
      shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells per Day/Spells Known:</strong> At each agent retriever level, the character gains new spells per
      day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he or she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he
      or she belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an epic spellcaster, the character gains only
      the benefit noted under the Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other benefit
      a character of that class would have gained. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming
      an agent retriever, the player must decide to which class to add the new level for the purpose of determining
      spells per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Uncanny Location</i> (Sp):</strong> When a agent retriever spends one day attuning him or herself to a
      person or object he or she is seeking, he or she automatically determines that person’s or item’s location as the
      <i>discern location</i> spell. Once he or she has established a sense of the location, the agent retriever can
      maintain this uncanny link even if the target moves, but only so long as he or she hunts down this person or item
      to the exclusion of all other pursuits. If he or she ever turns aside to undertake a second pursuit, the
      <i>uncanny location</i> ends, and the agent retriever must spend another day to reattune him or herself to the
      target.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tracking Bonus (Ex):</strong> The agent retriever gains a +10 insight bonus on Wilderness Lore checks to
      track the quarry. This bonus increases by +10 every five levels thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Plane Shift</i> (Sp):</strong> The agent retriever can use <i>plane shift</i> as a 14th-level caster
      once per day starting at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Force Sphere</i> (Sp):</strong> The agent retriever gains the ability to call forth a
      <i>force sphere.</i> The agent retriever can attempt to enclose any creature or object he or she can see within 30
      feet. The target is allowed a Reflex saving throw (DC 20 + 1/2 the class level of the agent retriever + the agent
      retriever’s Dexterity modifier). Those who fail are then encapsulated in a sphere of force with a radius of up to
      50 feet (the sphere is only as large as it needs to be, up to its maximum radius). Those trapped inside cannot
      escape except with methods that can bypass or destroy a <i>wall of force.</i>The sphere persists as long as the
      agent retriever desires, up to a maximum of seven days. A captured target does not count toward the capacity of
      the agent retriever’s <i>plane shift</i> ability, and the agent retriever can plane shift with the target despite
      the presence of the <i>force sphere.</i> The agent retriever can use this power once per day at 3rd level, plus
      one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Ethereal Jaunt</i> (Sp):</strong> The agent retriever can use <i>ethereal jaunt</i> as a 14th-level
      caster once per day at 4th level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Feats:</strong> The agent retriever gets a bonus feat at 5th level and an additional bonus feat
      every five levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Epic Endurance, Epic
      Prowess, Epic Speed, Epic Toughness, Epic Weapon Focus, Fast Healing, Improved Combat Casting, Improved Spell
      Capacity, Legendary Climber, Legendary Rider, Legendary Tracker, Perfect Health, Permanent Emanation, Spontaneous
      Spell, Storm of Throws, Swarm of Arrows, and Uncanny Accuracy.

    <h3 id="cosmic-descryer--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>The following are class features of the cosmic descryer prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A cosmic descryer gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or
      shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells per Day/Spells Known:</strong> At every other cosmic descryer level, the character gains new spells
      per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he or she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which
      he or she belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an epic spellcaster, the character gains
      only the benefit noted under the Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other
      benefit a character of that class would have gained. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before
      becoming a cosmic descryer, the player must decide to which class to add the new level for the purpose of
      determining spells per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Superior Planar Summoning (Ex):</strong> Beginning at 1st level, the cosmic descryer can increase the
      power of any of the following spells—<i
        >elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar binding, summon monster IX,</i
      >
      or <i>summon nature’s ally IX—to</i>affect or summon outsiders of 4 Hit Dice higher than the spell’s normal limit
      or conjure creatures with 4 Hit Dice of advancement. Every four levels thereafter, the cosmic descryer can
      increase the number of extra Hit Dice by 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Naturalization (Ex):</strong> Starting at 2nd level, the cosmic descryer develops a natural affinity for
      one plane that he or she has visited, becoming resistant to any spells and spell-like effects that would normally
      affect any creature not native to that plane. Every two levels thereafter, the cosmic descryer gains
      naturalization to one additional plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Enduring Gate (Su):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, as a full-round action, the cosmic descryer can make
      any casting of the <i>gate</i> spell remain for a full day, rather than disappearing after 1 round per caster
      level. Every three levels thereafter, the cosmic descryer can increase the duration of <i>gate</i> by one
      additional day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Feat (Ex):</strong> The cosmic descryer gains a bonus feat at 5th level and an additional bonus feat
      every five levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Augmented Alchemy,
      Automatic Quicken Spell, Automatic Silent Spell, Automatic Still Spell, Combat Casting, Craft Epic Magic Arms and
      Armor, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Epic Staff, Craft Epic Wondrous Item, Efficient Item Creation, Enhance Spell, Epic
      Spell Focus, Epic Spell Penetration, Epic Spellcasting, Familiar Spell, Forge Epic Ring, Ignore Material
      Components, Improved Combat Casting, Improved Heighten Spell, Improved Metamagic, Improved Spell Capacity,
      Intensify Spell, Multispell, Permanent Emanation, Scribe Epic Scroll, Spell Focus, Spell Knowledge, Spell Mastery,
      Spell Opportunity, Spell Penetration, Spell Stowaway, Spontaneous Spell, Tenacious Magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cosmic Connection (Su):</strong> At 7th level, the cosmic descryer may join with the massive energy of the
      multiverse once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter. The cosmic descryer can
      remain connected for a number of minutes equal to his or her class level. While connected, the character is immune
      to critical hits, is a native on any plane he or she visits, and can use <i>dimension door</i> at will as a
      20th-level caster. The cosmic descryer can draw off excess energy from the multiverse itself to increase his or
      her effective caster level or enhance any attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check. Drawing off
      excess energy from the multiverse is dangerous, and it deals the cosmic descryer 5 points of damage for each +1
      bonus applied to a single roll or +1 caster level on a single spell.

    <h3 id="divine-emissary--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are features of the divine emissary prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells per Day/Spells Known:</strong> At each divine emissary level, the character gains new spells per
      day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he or she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he
      or she belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an epic spell-caster, the character gains only
      the benefit noted under the Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other benefit
      a character of that class would have gained. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming
      a divine emissary, the player must decide to which class to add the new level for the purpose of determining
      spells per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special Mount:</strong> If he or she has one, the divine emissary’s special mount continues to increase in
      power. Every five levels after 1st, the special mount gains +2 bonus Hit Dice, its natural armor increases by +2,
      its Strength adjustment increases by +1, and its Intelligence increases by +1. The mount’s spell resistance equals
      the divine emissary’s class level + the class level that provided the special mount + 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Granted Domain (Ex):</strong> A divine emissary gains access to one of his or her deity’s domains, as well
      as the granted power of that domain. The extra domain expands a paladin’s selection of spells, but he or she does
      not gain the ability to cast higher-level spells than he or she otherwise could. Clerics gain an additional domain
      but otherwise use the rules for preparing spells from their domains normally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Divine Inspiration</i> (Sp):</strong> A divine emissary gains a +2 luck bonus on his or her attack and
      damage rolls for 10 rounds, once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day every three levels
      thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Extra Smite (Su):</strong> A divine emissary can use his or her smite ability two extra times per day,
      plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter. To determine the damage with any smite attack, a
      divine emissary adds together his or her divine emissary levels and class levels that originally conferred the
      smite ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Greater Planar Ally</i> (Sp):</strong> The emissary can call a <i>greater planar ally</i> (as the
      spell) once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day every ten levels thereafter. The ally does not
      request a return favor when a divine emissary uses this ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Feats:</strong> The divine emissary gains a bonus feat at 6th level and an additional bonus feat
      every ten levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Armor Skin, Devastating
      Critical, Epic Leadership, Epic Prowess, Epic Reputation, Epic Toughness, Epic Weapon Focus, Great Smiting, Holy
      Strike, Improved Aura of Courage, Improved Combat Casting, Improved Spell Capacity, Legendary Commander, Legendary
      Rider, Overwhelming Critical, Perfect Health, Permanent Emanation, Planar Turning, Positive Energy Aura, Spectral
      Strike, Spontaneous Spell, Widen Aura of Courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Divine Hand (Su):</strong> As a free action, the emissary gains a +20 sacred (or profane if appropriate)
      bonus on his next melee or ranged attack roll, as long as the attack is made with the deity’s favored weapon. The
      emissary can use divine hand once per day at 9th level, plus one additional time per day every ten levels
      thereafter.

    <h3 id="epic-infiltrator--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>The following are class features of the epic infiltrator prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> An epic infiltrator is proficient with all simple and martial
      weapons, all armor, and shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved Cover Identity (Ex/Su):</strong> At 1st level, an epic infiltrator establishes three specific
      cover identities, plus one additional cover identity every four levels thereafter. While operating in a cover
      identity, the epic infiltra-tor gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +2 circumstance bonus on
      Bluff and Gather Information checks. When the epic infiltrator has the option of adding a new cover identity, he
      or she may instead work on further perfecting a cover identity already possessed. An improved cover identity
      grants a +6 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Gather Information
      checks while operating in that identity. A specific cover identity may be improved multiple times, each time
      adding +2 to the bonuses. It is impossible to detect the epic infiltrator’s alignment with any form of divination.
      This ability functions exactly like an <i>undetectable alignment</i> spell, except that it is always active as a
      supernatural ability. Only divinations are confounded; spells that function only against certain alignments affect
      the epic infiltrator normally. Should the epic infiltrator wish to “retire” a cover identity and develop a new
      one, he or she must spend one week practicing the new identity before he or she earns the bonuses. Cover
      identities do not in themselves provide the epic infiltrator with additional skills, proficiencies, or class
      features that others might expect of the pretended professions. The epic infiltrator can switch cover identities
      or don a disguise using the Disguise skill in 1d3 minutes. He or she can also put on or take off armor in one-half
      the normal time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sneak Attack:</strong> If an epic infiltrator can catch an opponent when the opponent is unable to defend
      effectively from his or her attack, he or she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time the epic
      infiltrator’s target would be denied his or her Dexterity bonus to AC (whether he or she actually has a Dexterity
      bonus or not), the epic infiltrator’s attack deals +1d6 points of damage. This extra damage increases by +1d6
      points every three levels. Should the epic infiltrator score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage
      is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is 30 feet away or less. With a
      sap or an unarmed strike, the epic infiltrator can make a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal
      damage. He or she cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack, not even
      with the usual –4 penalty. An epic infiltrator can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible
      anatomies—undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Additionally,
      any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. Also, the epic infiltrator must also be
      able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital spot. The epic
      infiltrator cannot sneak attack while striking at a creature with concealment or by striking the limbs of a
      creature whose vitals are beyond reach. If an epic infiltrator gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the
      bonuses to damage stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Specialist Training (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, the epic infiltrator gains the benefit of focusing his or
      her craft on a particular type of work, specializing in one of the following categories and receiving a +3 bonus
      on all checks with the listed skills. Every three levels thereafter, the epic infiltrator gains specialist
      training again. He or she may select the same category more than once.
    </p>
    <p><em>Concealment:</em> Bluff, Disguise, and Forgery.</p>
    <p><em>Subterfuge:</em> Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, and Pick Pocket.</p>
    <p><em>Espionage:</em> Listen, Search, and Spot.</p>
    <p><em>Interaction:</em> Diplomacy, Gather Information, Intimidate, and Sense Motive.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Read Thoughts (Su):</strong> Beginning at 3rd level, the epic infiltrator can <i>detect thoughts</i> as
      the spell cast by a 15th-level caster, except that it targets a single mind. Every four levels thereafter, the
      epic infiltrator can per-form this ability one additional time per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Far Senses (Su):</strong> Starting at 4th level, the epic infiltrator can extend his or her vision or
      hearing into an area beyond his or her normal range, once per day, to a distance of 20 feet plus an additional 20
      feet per epic infiltrator level. The epic infiltrator must have personally visited the physical location earlier
      to use far senses on it. Barriers do not impede far senses, and low-light vision or darkvision function normally
      if the epic infiltrator has one or both of those abilities. Far senses can also apply to the epic infiltrator’s
      read thoughts ability. Every two levels beyond 4th the epic infiltrator can perform this ability one additional
      time per day. This ability functions as the <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i> spell cast by a 15th-level caster,
      except for the limit on range, the need to know the locale beforehand, and the ability to use the read thoughts
      ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Mind Blank</i> (Sp):</strong> At 3rd level, the epic infiltrator can become immune to all
      mind-affecting spells and divinations once per day, plus one additional time per day every eight levels
      thereafter. This ability works as the <i>mind blank</i> spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

    <h3 id="guardian-paramount--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>The following are class features of the guardian paramount prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A guardian paramount is proficient with all simple and martial
      weapons, all armor, and shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Feats:</strong> The guardian paramount gets a bonus feat at 1st level and an additional bonus feat
      every three levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Bulwark of Defense,
      Combat Archery, Damage Reduction, Dexterous Fortitude, Dexterous Will, Epic Dodge, Epic Fortitude, Epic Reflexes,
      Epic Reputation, Epic Skill Focus, Epic Speed, Epic Toughness, Epic Trapfinding, Epic Will, Exceptional
      Deflection, Fast Healing, Great Dexterity, Improved Combat Reflexes, Improved Sneak Attack, Improved Spell
      Resistance, Infinite Deflection, Legendary Climber, Lingering Damage, Mobile Defense, Perfect Health, Reflect
      Arrows, Self-Concealment, Sneak Attack of Opportunity, Spellcasting Harrier, and Uncanny Accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uncanny Dodge Enabler (Ex):</strong> The guardian paramount must have the uncanny dodge class feature to
      qualify for the prestige class, so at a minimum the guardian paramount has the extraordinary ability to retain his
      or her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker.
      It is possible that the character has higher-level aspects of the uncanny dodge ability. Whatever the level of
      uncanny dodge attained by the character, the guardian paramount can extend the features of his or her uncanny
      dodge ability to include any one creature he or she designates within 5 feet of him or her (he or she can
      designate a creature or change designations as a free action once per round). The guardian paramount can extend
      his or her uncanny dodge ability three times per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day every three
      levels thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Evasive Preceptor (Ex):</strong> The guardian paramount must have the evasion class feature, which allows
      the character to take no damage from an area attack with a successful Reflex save. He or she may also have
      improved evasion, though this is not a prerequisite. The character can extend evasion or improved evasion to
      include any one creature he or she designates within 5 feet of him or her. The guardian paramount can extend his
      or her evasion ability once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Protective Aura</i> (Sp):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, the guardian paramount can use a special form
      of <i>shield other</i> once per day, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter. When a
      guardian paramount creates a <i>protective aura,</i>the transferred wounds are dealt to the guardian paramount as
      subdual damage, not normal damage, as with the <i>shield other</i> spell. Otherwise, the guardian paramount’s
      <i>protective aura</i> functions like the <i>shield other spell</i> cast by an 8th-level cleric.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Adjust Probability (Ex):</strong> On reaching 5th level, the guardian paramount gains the ability to
      affect probability twice per day, plus one additional time per day per three levels thereafter. The guardian
      paramount can force a reroll of one attack roll, check, or saving throw that another creature within 25
      feet—friend or enemy—just made. The guardian paramount can find out whether the attack roll, check, or save would
      have succeeded before using this ability. The recipient must take the second roll, whether it’s better or worse
      than the original roll. The use of this ability takes place outside the normal initiative order, but the paramount
      guardian can’t use it if he or she is flat-footed or unable to see the situation resulting in the roll. The
      guardian paramount must decide whether to reroll as soon as the result of the attack roll, check, or save is
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Call Back</i> (Sp):</strong> On reaching 6th level, the guardian paramount gains the ability to return
      a dead creature that he or she has previously used any of his or her other class abilities on back to life, as if
      he or she had cast <i>true resurrection</i> as a 20th-level cleric. The character can use this ability once per
      day, plus one additional time per day every six levels.

    <h3 id="high-proselytizer--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>The following are class features of the high proselytizer prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> High proselytizers are proficient with all simple weapons, all
      armor, and all shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells per Day:</strong> At every other high proselytizer level, the character gains new spells per day as
      if he or she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which he or she belonged before adding the
      prestige class level. If already an epic spellcaster, the character gains only the benefit noted under the Spells
      entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would
      have gained. If the character had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a high proselytizer, the
      player must decide to which class to add each high proselytizer level for the purpose of determining spells per
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Proselytize</i> (Sp):</strong> At 1st level, the high proselytizer gains the ability to preach the word
      of his or her deity to large crowds with great effect. He or she may speak in such a manner once per day, plus one
      additional time per day per ten class levels thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Proselytize</i> has three effects. First, any time the high proselytizer is speaking in this manner, he or she
      is treated as though affected by a <i>sanctuary</i> spell. Second, his or her voice can be heard clearly by anyone
      within a radius of 100 feet plus 50 feet per class level, regardless of background noise, and his or her speech
      can be understood as though the audience were affected by a <i>comprehend languages</i> spell. Finally, everyone
      in the range of the high proselytizer’s voice immediately has a chance of becoming enraptured:

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      Enraptured audience members act as though affected by a
      <i>symbol of persuasion</i>, changing alignment as appropriate and otherwise functioning according to the
      <i>charm person</i> spell. The high proselytizer can inspire the crowd to take any of a number of actions,
      depending on his or her alignment. Any suicidal suggestion grants audience members a new saving throw to break the
      rapture (with the exception of low-level followers of the same deity, who never got a save in the first place).
      This rapture lasts for 10 minutes plus an additional 5 minutes per high proselytizer level.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 3rd level, the high proselytizer’s proselytize ability includes deific touch once per day, plus one additional
      time per day per ten levels thereafter. During his or her speech, the high proselytizer can move among the
      enraptured, shaking hands, caressing brows, and otherwise making contact with audience members. Anyone so touched
      is healed of 1d4 points of damage and cured of any natural disease or poison. Up to six individuals per round can
      be so affected. An audience member can only benefit from deific touch once per proselytize session. The high
      proselytizer can use deific touch as long as his or her proselytize ability lasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 5th level, the <i>proselytize</i> ability includes <i>deific word</i> once per day, plus one additional time
      per day per ten levels thereafter. The words spoken by the high proselytizer can, if he or she chooses, function
      as a triple-strength <i>sound burst</i> spell (3d8 points of sonic damage and a Will save to avoid being stunned
      for 3 rounds) to all who are not enraptured, as the spell cast by a 20th-level cleric. The <i>deific word</i> can
      occur at any point during his or her <i>proselytize</i> speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 7th level, the <i>proselytize</i> ability includes <i>deific face</i> once per day, plus one additional time
      per day per ten levels thereafter. When the high proselytizer speaks, he or she can cause a blinding burst to
      shine from his or her face. <i>Deific face</i> functions against all in the audience who are not enraptured as the
      <i>sunburst</i> spell cast by a 20th-level cleric. The <i>deific face</i> can occur at any point during his or her
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 9th level, the <i>proselytize</i> ability includes <i>deific aura</i> once per day, plus one additional time

    <p>The following are class features of the legendary dreadnought prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A legendary dreadnought is proficient with all simple and martial
      weapons, all armor, and all shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Unstoppable (Ex):</strong> At 1st level, the legendary dreadnought can concentrate his or her power,
      gaining a +20 bonus on his or her Strength check to break or burst a door or item once per day, plus one
      additional time per day every five levels thereafter. As a special use of this ability, the legendary dreadnought
      can attempt to break a <i>wall of force</i> (Strength DC 32, and the character applies his or her unstoppable
      bonus to this check as well). Alternatively, the legendary dreadnought can apply the +20 bonus to a single attack
      roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Unmovable (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, the legendary dreadnought can concentrate his or her power, making
      him or herself unmovable once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter. This power
      grants the character a +20 bonus on any one of the following:
    </p>
    <p>A grapple check made to avoid being grabbed with the improved grab ability.</p>
    <p>A Strength check to avoid the effects of a bull rush, trip attempt, or similar effect.</p>
    <p>A Strength check against any effect that would move the character either physically or magically.</p>
    <p>
      Any one saving throw. If an effect that would move the character either physically or magically does not normally
      allow a saving throw, the legendary dreadnought can use this ability to gain a Will saving throw. He or she still
      gains the +20 bonus on the saving throw in such a case.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shrug off Punishment (Ex):</strong> The legendary dreadnought gains 12 bonus hit points at 3rd level and
      12 more every five levels thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Thick Skinned (Ex):</strong> At 4th level, the legendary dreadnought gains damage reduction 3/–. This does
      not stack with damage reduction granted by magic items or nonpermanent magical effects, but it does stack with any
      damage reduction granted by permanent magical effects, class features, the Damage Reduction feat, and this ability
      itself. The damage reduction improves by 3 points every five levels thereafter
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Feats:</strong> The legendary dreadnought gets a bonus feat at 5th level and an additional bonus
      feat every five levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Armor Skin,
      Devastating Critical, Dire Charge, Epic Fortitude, Epic Prowess, Epic Toughness, Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon
      Specialization, Fast Healing, Great Constitution, Great Strength, Improved Combat Reflexes, Overwhelming Critical,
      Penetrate Damage Reduction.

    <h3 id="perfect-wight--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>The following are class features of the perfect wight prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A perfect wight gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or
      shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Greater Invisibility (Su):</strong> Starting at 1st level, the perfect wight gains the benefit of
      <i>greater invisibility</i> once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter. The
      <i>greater invisibility</i> is as the spell cast by a 20th-level caster.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved Legerdemain (Su):</strong> A perfect wight can perform the following class skills at a range of
      30 feet: Disable Device, Open Lock, Pick Pocket, and Search. If desired, the perfect wight can take 10 on the
      check. Any object manipulated during the skill check must weigh 100 pounds or less. Alternatively, the perfect
      wight can use improved legerdemain to make one melee sneak attack against any creature within 30 feet. The perfect
      wight executes the sneak attack (or death attack, if applicable) as if attacking from a flanking position. If the
      attack is successful, the victim is dealt the appropriate sneak attack damage despite the fact that the perfect
      wight and his or her weapon do not physically cross the intervening distance. A perfect wight can use improved
      legerdemain once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Incorporeal (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, the perfect wight can become incorporeal once per day, plus one
      additional time per day every five levels thereafter. A perfect wight can remain incorporeal for a number of
      rounds equal to 20 + his or her perfect wight level. As an incorporeal creature, the perfect wight can be harmed
      only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, and
      supernatural abilities. He or she is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic
      weapons, the perfect wight has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for force
      effectsor attacks made with ghost touch weapons). An incorporeal perfect wight has no natural armor but has a
      deflection bonus equal to his or her Charisma modifier (always at least +1, even if his or her Charisma score does
      not normally provide a bonus). An incorporeal perfect wight can pass through solid objects at will, but not force
      effects. His or her attack ignores natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force
      effects work normally against it. An incorporeal perfect wight moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen
      checks if he or she doesn’t wish to be. While incorporeal, the perfect wight has no Strength score, so his or her
      Dexterity modifier applies to both melee and ranged attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shadow Form (Su):</strong> At 4th level, the perfect wight can take shadow form once per day, plus one
      additional time per day every five levels thereafter. The perfect wight’s shadow form lasts 1 minute per level of
      the prestige class. While in shadow form the perfect wight is incorporeal (see above), is immune to critical hits,
      and can fly at a speed of 100 feet (good). The perfect wight can also use the substance of his or her own shadow
      to enhance his or her effective level on any attack roll, check, or saving throw. Drawing power from his or her
      own shadow form deals the perfect wight 7 points of damage for each +1 bonus on a single roll or +1 effective
      level for any other single use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Feats:</strong> The perfect wight gets a bonus feat at 5th level and an additional bonus feat every
      five levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Blinding Speed, Combat
      Archery, Dexterous Fortitude, Dexterous Will, Epic Dodge, Epic Reputation, Epic Skill Focus, Epic Speed, Epic
      Trapfinding, Improved Combat Reflexes, Improved Sneak Attack, Legendary Climber, Lingering Damage,
      Self-Concealment, Sneak Attack of Opportunity, Spellcasting Harrier, Superior Initiative, Uncanny Accuracy.
