    <h3 id="barbarian--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are class features of the barbarian.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barbarian--class-features--weapon-and-armor-proficiency">Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A
      barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower
      shields).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barbarian--class-features--fast-movement-ex">Fast Movement (Ex):</strong> A barbarian’s land speed is
      faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor,
      or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian’s speed because of
      any load carried or armor worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barbarian--class-features--illiteracy">Illiteracy:</strong> Barbarians are the only characters who do
      not automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and
      write all languages he is able to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a
      barbarian level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barbarian--class-features--rage-ex">Rage (Ex):</strong> A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain
      number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to
      Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in
      Constitution increases the barbarian’s hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end
      of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way
      temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based
      skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that
      require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a
      spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has
      except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds
      equal to 3 + the character’s (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At
      the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (–2 penalty to
      Strength, –2 penalty to Dexterity, can’t charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a
      17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies; see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At
      4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times
      per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action,
      not in response to someone else’s action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barbarian--class-features--uncanny-dodge-ex">Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a barbarian
      retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker.
      However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a
      different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barbarian--class-features--trap-sense-ex">Trap Sense (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian
      gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps.
      These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap
      sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barbarian--class-features--improved-uncanny-dodge-ex">Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> At 5th
      level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack
      the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has
      barbarian levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character
      automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack
      to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barbarian--class-features--damage-reduction-ex">Damage Reduction (Ex):</strong> At 7th level, a
      barbarian gains Damage Reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from
      a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th
      level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barbarian--class-features--greater-rage-ex">Greater Rage (Ex):</strong> At 11th level, a barbarian’s
      bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves
      increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at –2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barbarian--class-features--indomitable-will-ex">Indomitable Will (Ex):</strong> While in a rage, a
      barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks
      with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barbarian--class-features--tireless-rage-ex">Tireless Rage (Ex):</strong> At 17th level and higher, a
      barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="barbarian--class-features--mighty-rage-ex">Mighty Rage (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a barbarian’s
      bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves
      increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at –2.
    </p>
    <h3 id="barbarian--ex-barbarians">Ex-Barbarians</h3>
    <p>
      A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. He retains
      all the other benefits of the class (damage reduction, fast movement, trap sense, and uncanny dodge).
    </p>

    <p><strong id="bard--hit-die">Hit Die:</strong> d6.</p>
    <h3 id="bard--class-skills">Class Skills</h3>
    <p>
      The bard’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb
      (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist
      (Dex), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Listen
      (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Speak
      Language (n/a), Spellcraft (Int), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).

    <h3 id="bard--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are class features of the bard.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="bard--class-features--weapon-and-armor-proficiency">Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A bard is
      proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are
      proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light
      armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard
      wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question
      has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for
      arcane spells received from other classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="bard--class-features--spells">Spells:</strong> A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the
      bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal
      component (singing, reciting, or music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at
      least 10 + the spell. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the
      bard’s Charisma modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base
      daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Bard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high
      Charisma score. When Table: Bard Spells Known indicates that the bard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell
      level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bard’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your
      choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Bard Spells Known.
      (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on
      Table: Bard Spells Known are fixed.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to
      learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard “loses” the old spell in exchange for the
      new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two
      levels lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given
      level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time,
      assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="bard--class-features--bardic-knowledge">Bardic Knowledge:</strong> A bard may make a special bardic
      knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some
      relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more
      ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its
      general function. A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random.

      <strong id="bard--class-features--bardic-music">Bardic Music:</strong> Once per day per bard level, a bard can use
      his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While
      these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing
      instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies,
      whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each
      ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a
      bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music
      ability until he acquires the needed ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which
      means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that
      doesn’t require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as
      scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just as for casting a spell with a verbal
      component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt
      still counts against his daily limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="bard--class-features--bardic-music--countersong-su">Countersong (Su):</em> A bard with 3 or more ranks in
      a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that
      simply have verbal components). Each round of the countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30
      feet of the bard (including the bard himself ) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack
      may use the bard’s Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the
      Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the
      effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the
      effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard’s Perform check result for the save.
      Countersong has no effect against effects that don’t allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10
      rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="bard--class-features--bardic-music--fascinate-sp">Fascinate (Sp):</em> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a
      Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each
      creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him.
      The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the
      ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with
      a single use of this ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature’s Will
      save against the effect. If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature
      again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other
      actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level).
      While fascinated, a target takes a –4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks.
      Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw
      against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target,
      automatically breaks the effect.
      <i>Fascinate</i> is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="bard--class-features--bardic-music--inspire-courage-su">Inspire Courage (Su):</em> A bard with 3 or more
      ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himself ), bolstering
      them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard
      sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally
      receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and
      weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3
      at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="bard--class-features--bardic-music--inspire-competence-su">Inspire Competence (Su):</em> A bard of 3rd
      level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a
      task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the
      ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear
      the bard’s music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates,
      up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can’t inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting
      ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="bard--class-features--bardic-music--suggestion-sp">Suggestion (Sp):</em> A bard of 6th level or higher
      with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a <i>suggestion</i> (as the spell) to a creature that he has
      already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not break the bard’s concentration on the
      <i>fascinate</i> effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the <i>fascinate</i> effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making a <i>suggestion</i> doesn’t count against a bard’s daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving
      throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard’s level + bard’s Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single
      creature (but see <i>mass suggestion</i>, below). <i>Suggestion</i> is an enchantment (compulsion),
      mind-affecting, language dependent ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="bard--class-features--bardic-music--inspire-greatness-su">Inspire Greatness (Su):</em> A bard of 9th level
      or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a
      single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard
      attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three
      at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts
      for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains
      2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target’s Constitution
      modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on
      Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit
      Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="bard--class-features--bardic-music--song-of-freedom-sp">Song of Freedom (Sp):</em> A bard of 12th level or
      higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the
      <i>break enchantment</i> spell (caster level equals the character’s bard level). Using this ability requires 1
      minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can’t
      use <i>song of freedom</i> on himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="bard--class-features--bardic-music--inspire-heroics-su">Inspire Heroics (Su):</em> A bard of 15th level or
      higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself
      or a single willing ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can
      inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard
      sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC.
      The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is
      a mind-affecting ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="bard--class-features--bardic-music--mass-suggestion-sp">Mass Suggestion (Sp):</em> This ability functions
      like <i>suggestion,</i> above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill
      can make the <i>suggestion</i> simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already fascinated (see
      above). <i>Mass suggestion</i> is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.

    <h3 id="cleric--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are class features of the cleric.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="cleric--class-features--weapon-and-armor-proficiency">Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Clerics
      are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields
      (except tower shields).
    </p>
    <p>
      A cleric who chooses the War domain receives the Weapon Focus feat related to his deity’s weapon as a bonus feat.
      He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that
      category.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="cleric--class-features--aura-ex">Aura (Ex):</strong> A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful
      deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity’s alignment (see the <i>detect evil</i> spell
      for details). Clerics who don’t worship a specific deity but choose the Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain have
      a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="cleric--class-features--spells">Spells:</strong> A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from
      the cleric spell list. However, his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or
      ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in
      advance (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The
      Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric’s Wisdom
      modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base
      daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Cleric. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a
      high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level.
      When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see Deities,
      Domains, and Domain Spells, below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day
      in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect
      on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided
      that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="cleric--class-features--deity-domains-and-domain-spells">Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells:</strong> A
      cleric’s deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. A cleric
      chooses two domains from among those belonging to his deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil,
      Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two domains to represent his spiritual
      inclinations and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as
      a granted power. The cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his domain
      spell slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell
      slot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="cleric--class-features--spontaneous-casting">Spontaneous Casting:</strong> A good cleric (or a neutral
      cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead
      of time. The cleric can “lose” any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any
      <i>cure</i> spell of the same spell level or lower (a <i>cure</i> spell is any spell with “cure” in its name).
    </p>
    <p>
      An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), can’t convert prepared spells to <i>cure</i> spells but can
      convert them to <i>inflict</i> spells (an <i>inflict</i> spell is one with “inflict” in its name).
    </p>
    <p>
      A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either
      <i>cure</i> spells or <i>inflict</i> spells (player’s choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be
      reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or commands undead (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="cleric--class-features--chaotic-evil-good-and-lawful-spells"
        >Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:</strong
      >
      A cleric can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity’s (if he has one). Spells associated
      with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell
      descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="cleric--class-features--turn-or-rebuke-undead-su">Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su):</strong> Any cleric,
      regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by channeling the power of his faith through his
      holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead).
    </p>
    <p>
      A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil cleric
      (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures. A neutral cleric of a
      neutral deity must choose whether his turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once
      this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous
      <i>cure</i> or <i>inflict</i> spells (see above).
    </p>
    <p>
      A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5
      or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="cleric--class-features--bonus-languages">Bonus Languages:</strong> A cleric’s bonus language options
      include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders,
      respectively). These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his
      race.
    </p>
    <h3 id="cleric--ex-clerics">Ex-Clerics</h3>
    <p>
      A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells and class features, except
      for armor and shield proficiencies and proficiency with simple weapons. He cannot thereafter gain levels as a
      cleric of that god until he atones (see the
      <i>atonement</i> spell description).
    </p>

    <h3 id="druid--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are class features of the druid.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--weapon-and-armor-proficiency">Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Druids are
      proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and
      spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with
      wild shape (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear
      only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the
      <i>ironwood</i> spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the <i>ironwood</i> spell description)
      Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her
      supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--spells">Spells:</strong> A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the
      druid spell list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical
      beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance
      (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The
      Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid’s Wisdom modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base
      daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a
      high Wisdom score. She does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.
    </p>
    <p>
      A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a
      <i>cure</i> spell in its place (but see Spontaneous Casting, below). A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the
      druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare
      during her daily meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--spontaneous-casting">Spontaneous Casting:</strong> A druid can channel stored
      spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn’t prepared ahead of time. She can “lose” a prepared spell in
      order to cast any <i>summon nature’s ally</i> spell of the same level or lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--chaotic-evil-good-and-lawful-spells"
        >Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:</strong
      >
      A druid can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells associated
      with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell
      descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--bonus-languages">Bonus Languages:</strong> A druid’s bonus language options
      include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to
      the character because of her race.
    </p>
    <p>
      A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level
      druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of
      languages and it doesn’t take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.
    </p>
    <p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--animal-companion-ex">Animal Companion (Ex):</strong> A druid may begin play
      with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk,
      horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or
      partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark,
      and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A 1st-level druid’s companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As a druid advances in
      level, the animal’s power increases as shown on the table. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may
      gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace
      an animal companion that has perished.
    </p>
    <p>
      A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals (see below). Should she select an
      animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character’s druid
      level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the
      character’s druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the table to determine the animal
      companion’s powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid’s effective level to 0 or lower, she can’t have
      that animal as a companion.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--nature-sense-ex">Nature Sense (Ex):</strong> A druid gains a +2 bonus on
      Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--wild-empathy-ex">Wild Empathy (Ex):</strong> A druid can improve the attitude
      of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The
      druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be
      within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute
      but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes
      a –4 penalty on the check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--woodland-stride-ex">Woodland Stride (Ex):</strong> Starting at 2nd level, a
      druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar
      terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars,
      and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--trackless-step-ex">Trackless Step (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, a druid
      leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--resist-natures-lure-ex">Resist Nature’s Lure (Ex):</strong> Starting at 4th
      level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--wild-shape-su">Wild Shape (Su):</strong> At 5th level, a druid gains the
      ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms
      include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>polymorph</i> spell, except as
      noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or
      back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.</p>
    <p>
      A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal,
      untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her
      new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, as noted on Table: The
      Druid. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th
      level, and a Huge animal at 15th level.
    </p>
    <p>The new form’s Hit Dice can’t exceed the character’s druid level.</p>
    <p>
      At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant creature with the same size
      restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can’t use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn’t a
      creature.)
    </p>
    <p>
      At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air,
      earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In
      addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental’s extraordinary, supernatural, and
      spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental’s feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but she
      retains her own creature type.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three
      times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--venom-immunity-ex">Venom Immunity (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a druid gains
      immunity to all poisons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--a-thousand-faces-su">A Thousand Faces (Su):</strong> At 13th level, a druid
      gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self</i> spell, but only while in her
      normal form.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="druid--class-features--timeless-body-ex">Timeless Body (Ex):</strong> After attaining 15th level, a
      druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have
      already incurred, however, remain in place.
    </p>
    <p>Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>
    <h3 id="druid--ex-druids">Ex-Druids</h3>
    <p>
      A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a
      nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor,
      and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the
      <i>atonement</i> spell description).
    </p>
    <h3 id="druid--the-druids-animal-companion">The Druid’s Animal Companion</h3>
    <p>
      A druid’s animal companion is different from a normal animal of its kind in many ways. A druid’s animal companion
      is superior to a normal animal of its kind and has special powers, as described below.

    <p>
      <em id="druid--the-druids-animal-companion--animal-companion-basics--class-level">Class Level:</em> The
      character’s druid level. The druid’s class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to an
      animal companion for the purpose of determining the companion’s abilities and the alternative lists available to
      the character.

    <p>
      <em id="druid--the-druids-animal-companion--animal-companion-basics--bonus-hd">Bonus HD:</em> Extra eight-sided
      (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Remember that extra Hit Dice improve the
      animal companion’s base attack and base save bonuses. An animal companion’s base attack bonus is the same as that
      of a druid of a level equal to the animal’s HD. An animal companion has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it
      as a character whose level equals the animal’s HD). An animal companion gains additional skill points and feats
      for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster’s Hit Dice.

      <em id="druid--the-druids-animal-companion--animal-companion-basics--bonus-tricks">Bonus Tricks:</em> The value
      given in this column is the total number of “bonus” tricks that the animal knows in addition to any that the druid
      might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill). These bonus tricks don’t require any training time or
      Handle Animal checks, and they don’t count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. The druid
      selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can’t be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="druid--the-druids-animal-companion--animal-companion-basics--link-ex">Link (Ex):</em> A druid can handle
      her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn’t have any ranks in the
      Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks
      made regarding an animal companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="druid--the-druids-animal-companion--animal-companion-basics--share-spells-ex">Share Spells (Ex):</em> At
      the druid’s option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts upon herself also affect her
      animal companion. The animal companion must be within 5 feet of her at the time of casting to receive the benefit.
      If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the animal companion if the
      companion moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the animal again, even if it returns to the druid
      before the duration expires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the druid may cast a spell with a target of “You” on her animal companion (as a touch range spell)
      instead of on herself. A druid and her animal companion can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect
      creatures of the companion’s type (animal).

      <em id="druid--the-druids-animal-companion--animal-companion-basics--evasion-ex">Evasion (Ex):</em> If an animal
      companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage
      if it makes a successful saving throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="druid--the-druids-animal-companion--animal-companion-basics--devotion-ex">Devotion (Ex):</em> An animal
      companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="druid--the-druids-animal-companion--animal-companion-basics--multiattack">Multiattack:</em> An animal
      companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that
      feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second
      attack with its primary natural weapon, albeit at a –5 penalty.

    </table>
    <h3 id="monk--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are class features of the monk.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--weapon-and-armor-proficiency">Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Monks are
      proficient with club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai,
      shuriken, siangham, and sling.
    </p>
    <p>Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields</p>
    <p>
      When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her
      fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--ac-bonus-ex">AC Bonus (Ex):</strong> When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk
      adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus
      increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).
    </p>
    <p>
      These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when
      she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium
      or heavy load.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--flurry-of-blows-ex">Flurry of Blows (Ex):</strong> When unarmored, a monk may
      strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round
      at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a –2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round.
      The resulting modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of Blows Attack Bonus column on Table: The
      Monk. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make before her
      next action. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to –1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must
      use a full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama,
      nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk weapons
      interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus
      (not Str bonus x 1-1/2 or x 1/2) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in
      one or both hands. The monk can’t use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows
      ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse unarmed strikes with
      quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra
      attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--unarmed-strike">Unarmed Strike:</strong> At 1st level, a monk gains Improved
      Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk’s attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows,
      knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing
      as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls
      for all her unarmed strikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually a monk’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no
      penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.
    </p>
    <p>
      A monk’s unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells
      and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table: The Monk.
      The unarmed damage on Table: The Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given
      there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed
      Damage.

    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--bonus-feat">Bonus Feat:</strong> At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved
      Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may select either Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as
      a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may select either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. A monk need
      not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--evasion-ex">Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a
      successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead
      takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not
      gain the benefit of evasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--fast-movement-ex">Fast Movement (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a monk gains an
      enhancement bonus to her speed, as shown on Table: The Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load
      loses this extra speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--still-mind-ex">Still Mind (Ex):</strong> A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a
      +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--ki-strike-su"><i>Ki</i> Strike (Su):</strong> At 4th level, a monk’s unarmed
      attacks are empowered with <i>ki.</i> Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing
      damage to creatures with damage reduction. <i>Ki</i> strike improves with the character’s monk level. At 10th
      level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with
      damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of dealing
      damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--slow-fall-ex">Slow Fall (Ex):</strong> At 4th level or higher, a monk within
      arm’s reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the
      fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk’s ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the
      effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk level until at 20th level she can use a
      nearby wall to slow her descent and fall any distance without harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--purity-of-body-ex">Purity of Body (Ex):</strong> At 5th level, a monk gains
      immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--wholeness-of-body-su">Wholeness of Body (Su):</strong> At 7th level or higher, a
      monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level
      each day, and she can spread this healing out among several uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--improved-evasion-ex">Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a monk’s
      evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but
      henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved
      evasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--diamond-body-su">Diamond Body (Su):</strong> At 11th level, a monk gains
      immunity to poisons of all kinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--abundant-step-su">Abundant Step (Su):</strong> At 12th level or higher, a monk
      can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell <i>dimension door,</i> once per day. Her caster level for
      this effect is one-half her monk level (rounded down).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--diamond-soul-ex">Diamond Soul (Ex):</strong> At 13th level, a monk gains spell
      resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get
      a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk’s spell resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--quivering-palm-su">Quivering Palm (Su):</strong> Starting at 15th level, a monk
      can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She
      can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack roll.
      Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be
      affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering
      palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is
      made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to
      die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + the
      monk’s Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that
      particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--timeless-body-ex">Timeless Body (Ex):</strong> Upon attaining 17th level, a monk
      no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that
      she has already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her
      time is up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--tongue-of-the-sun-and-moon-ex">Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex):</strong> A monk
      of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--empty-body-su">Empty Body (Su):</strong> At 19th level, a monk gains the ability
      to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day, as though using the spell <i>etherealness</i>. She
      may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds
      spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="monk--class-features--perfect-self">Perfect Self:</strong> At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical
      creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk’s creature
      type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic,
      which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any
      natural attack made by a creature that doesn’t have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can
      still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.
    </p>
    <h3 id="monk--ex-monks">Ex-Monks</h3>
    <p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p>
    <p>
      Like a member of any other class, a monk may be a multiclass character, but multiclass monks face a special
      restriction. A monk who gains a new class or (if already multiclass) raises another class by a level may never
      again raise her monk level, though she retains all her monk abilities.
