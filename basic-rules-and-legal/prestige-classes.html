    <h1>PRESTIGE CLASSES</h1>
    <p>
      Prestige classes offer a new form of multiclassing. Unlike the basic classes, characters must meet Requirements
      before they can take their first level of a prestige class. The rules for level advancement apply to this system,
      meaning the first step of advancement is always choosing a class. If a character does not meet the Requirements
      for a prestige class before that first step, that character cannot take the first level of that prestige class.
      Taking a prestige class does not incur the experience point penalties normally associated with multiclassing.

    <h3 id="arcane-archer--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are Class Features of the arcane archer prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> An arcane archer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons,
      light armor, medium armor, and shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Enhance Arrow (Su):</strong> At 1st level, every nonmagical arrow an arcane archer nocks and lets fly
      becomes magical, gaining a +1 enhancement bonus. Unlike magic weapons created by normal means, the archer need not
      spend experience points or gold pieces to accomplish this task. However, an archer’s magic arrows only function
      for her. For every two levels the character advances past 1st level in the prestige class, the magic arrows she
      creates gain +1 greater potency (+1 at 1st level, +2 at 3rd level, +3 at 5th level, +4 at 7th level, and +5 at 9th
      level).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Imbue Arrow</i> (Sp):</strong> At 2nd level, an arcane archer gains the ability to place an area spell
      upon an arrow. When the arrow is fired, the spell’s area is centered on where the arrow lands, even if the spell
      could normally be centered only on the caster. This ability allows the archer to use the bow’s range rather than
      the spell’s range. It takes a standard action to cast the spell and fire the arrow. The arrow must be fired in the
      round the spell is cast, or the spell is wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Seeker Arrow</i> (Sp):</strong> At 4th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a
      target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable
      obstacle or the limit of the arrow’s range prevents the arrow’s flight. This ability negates cover and concealment
      modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the
      arrow is part of the action).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Phase Arrow</i> (Sp):</strong> At 6th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a
      target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target in a straight path, passing through any
      nonmagical barrier or wall in its way. (Any magical barrier stops the arrow.) This ability negates cover,
      concealment, and even armor modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally.
    </p>
    <p>Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action).</p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Hail of Arrows</i> (Sp):</strong> In lieu of her regular attacks, once per day an arcane archer of 8th
      level or higher can fire an arrow at each and every target within range, to a maximum of one target for every
      arcane archer level she has earned. Each attack uses the archer’s primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be
      targeted by a single arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Arrow of Death</i> (Sp):</strong> At 10th level, an arcane archer can create an
      <i>arrow of death</i> that forces the target, if damaged by the arrow’s attack, to make a DC 20 Fortitude save or
      be slain immediately. It takes one day to make an <i>arrow of death</i>, and the arrow only functions for the
      arcane archer who created it. The <i>arrow of death</i> lasts no longer than one year, and the archer can only
      have one such arrow in existence at a time.

    <h3 id="arcane-trickster--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are Class Features of the arcane trickster prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Arcane tricksters gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells per Day:</strong> When a new arcane trickster level is gained, the character gains new spells per
      day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He
      does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained, except for an increased
      effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an arcane
      trickster, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ranged Legerdemain:</strong> An arcane trickster can perform one of the following class skills at a range
      of 30 feet: Disable Device, Open Lock, or Sleight of Hand. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check
      DC by 5, and an arcane trickster cannot take 10 on this check. Any object to be manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or
      less.
    </p>
    <p>
      An arcane trickster can use ranged legerdemain once per day initially, twice per day upon attaining 5th level, and
      three times per day at 9th level or higher. He can make only one ranged legerdemain skill check each day, and only
      if he has at least 1 rank in the skill being used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sneak Attack:</strong> This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt
      increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If an arcane trickster gets a sneak attack
      bonus from another source the bonuses on damage stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Impromptu Sneak Attack:</strong> Beginning at 3rd level, once per day an arcane trickster can declare one
      melee or ranged attack he makes to be a sneak attack (the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if the
      impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of an impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to
      AC, but only against that attack. The power can be used against any target, but creatures that are not subject to
      critical hits take no extra damage (though they still lose any Dexterity bonus to AC against the attack).
    </p>
    <p>At 7th level, an arcane trickster can use this ability twice per day.</p>
    <h2 id="archmage">Archmage</h2>

    <h3 id="archmage--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All the following are <b>Class Features</b> of the archmage prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Archmages gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells per Day/Spells Known:</strong> When a new archmage level is gained, the character gains new spells
      per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class
      in which he could cast 7th-level spells before he added the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any
      other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting
      class in which he could cast 7th-level spells before he became an archmage, he must decide to which class he adds
      each level of archmage for the purpose of determining spells per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>High Arcana:</strong> An archmage gains the opportunity to select a special ability from among those
      described below by permanently eliminating one existing spell slot (she cannot eliminate a spell slot of higher
      level than the highest-level spell she can cast). Each special ability has a minimum required spell slot level, as
      specified in its description.
    </p>
    <p>
      An archmage may choose to eliminate a spell slot of a higher level than that required to gain a type of high
      arcana.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Arcane Fire (Su):</em> The archmage gains the ability to change arcane spell energy into arcane fire,
      manifesting it as a bolt of raw magical energy. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range (400 feet + 40
      feet/level of archmage) that deals 1d6 points of damage per class level of the archmage plus 1d6 points of damage
      per level of the spell used to create the effect. This ability costs one 9th-level spell slot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Arcane Reach (Su):</em> The archmage can use spells with a range of touch on a target up to 30 feet away. The
      archmage must make a ranged touch attack. Arcane reach can be selected a second time as a special ability, in
      which case the range increases to 60 feet. This ability costs one 7th-level spell slot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Mastery of Counterspelling:</em> When the archmage counterspells a spell, it is turned back upon the caster as
      if it were fully affected by a <i>spell turning</i> spell. If the spell cannot be affected by
      <i>spell turning</i>, then it is merely counterspelled. This ability costs one 7th-level spell slot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Mastery of Elements:</em> The archmage can alter an arcane spell when cast so that it utilizes a different
      element from the one it normally uses. This ability can only alter a spell with the acid, cold, fire, electricity,
      or sonic descriptor. The spell’s casting time is unaffected. The caster decides whether to alter the spell’s
      energy type and chooses the new energy type when he begins casting. This ability costs one 8th-level spell slot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Mastery of Shaping:</em> The archmage can alter area and effect spells that use one of the following shapes:
      burst, cone, cylinder, emanation, or spread. The alteration consists of creating spaces within the spell’s area or
      effect that are not subject to the spell. The minimum dimension for these spaces is a 5-foot cube. Furthermore,
      any shapeable spells have a minimum dimension of 5 feet instead of 10 feet. This ability costs one 6th-level spell
      slot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Spell Power:</em> This ability increases the archmage’s effective caster level by +1 (for purposes of
      determining level-dependent spell variables such as damage dice or range, and caster level checks only). This
      ability costs one 5th-level spell slot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Spell-Like Ability:</em> An archmage who selects this type of high arcana can use one of her arcane spell
      slots (other than a slot expended to learn this or any other type of high arcana) to permanently prepare one of
      her arcane spells as a spell-like ability that can be used twice per day. The archmage does not use any components
      when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so and a spell with a costly material
      component instead costs her 10 times that amount in XP. This ability costs one 5th-level spell slot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell-like ability normally uses a spell slot of the spell’s level, although the archmage can choose to make a
      spell modified by a metamagic feat into a spell-like ability at the appropriate spell level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archmage may use an available higher-level spell slot in order to use the spell-like ability more often. Using
      a slot three levels higher than the chosen spell allows her to use the spell-like ability four times per day, and
      a slot six levels higher lets her use it six times per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      If spell-like ability is selected more than one time as a high arcana choice, this ability can apply to the same
      spell chosen the first time (increasing the number of times per day it can be used) or to a different spell.

    <h3 id="assassin--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are Class Features of the assassin prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Assassins are proficient with the crossbow (hand, light, or heavy),
      dagger (any type), dart, rapier, sap, shortbow (normal and composite), and short sword. Assassins are proficient
      with light armor but not with shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sneak Attack:</strong> This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt
      increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If an assassin gets a sneak attack bonus from
      another source the bonuses on damage stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Death Attack:</strong> If an assassin studies his victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a
      melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either
      paralyzing or killing the target (assassin’s choice). While studying the victim, the assassin can undertake other
      actions so long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the assassin or
      recognize the assassin as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin’s
      class level + the assassin’s Int modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against
      the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of
      the assassin. If the victim’s saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the assassin
      has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if the assassin does not launch the attack
      within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death
      attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Poison Use:</strong> Assassins are trained in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning
      themselves when applying poison to a blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells:</strong> Beginning at 1st level, an assassin gains the ability to cast a number of arcane spells.
      To cast a spell, an assassin must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell’s level, so an assassin
      with an Intelligence of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Assassin bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and
      saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the assassin’s Intelligence bonus. When the
      assassin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based
      on his Intelligence score for that spell level.
    </p>
    <p>The assassin’s spell list appears below. An assassin casts spells just as a bard does.</p>
    <p>
      Upon reaching 6th level, at every even-numbered level after that (8th and 10th), an assassin can choose to learn a
      new spell in place of one he already knows. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being
      exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level assassin spell the assassin can cast.
      An assassin may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at
      the same time that he gains new spells known for that level.

    <p>
      <strong>Save Bonus against Poison:</strong> The assassin gains a natural saving throw bonus to all poisons gained
      at 2nd level that increases by +1 for every two additional levels the assassin gains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> Starting at 2nd level, an assassin retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any)
      regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to
      AC if immobilized.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge
      (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> At 5th level, an assassin can no longer be flanked, since he can
      react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies
      rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the assassin. The exception to this defense is that a
      rogue at least four levels higher than the assassin can flank him (and thus sneak attack him).
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class the character automatically gains improved
      uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hide in Plain Sight (Su):</strong> At 8th level, an assassin can use the Hide skill even while being
      observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, an assassin can hide himself from view in the
      open without having anything to actually hide behind.
    </p>
    <p>He cannot, however, hide in his own shadow.</p>

    <h3 id="blackguard--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are Class Features of the blackguard prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Blackguards are proficient with all simple and martial weapons,
      with all types of armor, and with shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Aura of Evil (Ex):</strong> The power of a blackguard’s aura of evil (see the <i>detect evil</i> spell) is
      equal to his class level plus his cleric level, if any.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Detect Good</i> (Sp):</strong> At will, a blackguard can use <i>detect good</i> as a spell-like
      ability, duplicating the effect of the <i>detect good</i> spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Poison Use:</strong> Blackguards are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning
      themselves when applying poison to a blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dark Blessing (Su):</strong> A blackguard applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all
      saving throws.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells:</strong> A blackguard has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a
      blackguard spell, a blackguard must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell’s level, so a blackguard with a
      Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blackguard bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level
      + the blackguard’s Wisdom modifier. When the blackguard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level he gains only
      the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The blackguard’s spell
      list appears below. A blackguard has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just
      as a cleric. A blackguard prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a blackguard cannot
      spontaneously cast
      <i>cure</i> or <i>inflict</i> spells).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Smite Good (Su):</strong> Once a day, a blackguard of 2nd level or higher may attempt to smite good with
      one normal melee attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      He adds his Charisma modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class level.
      If a blackguard accidentally smites a creature that is not good, the smite has no effect but it is still used up
      for that day.
    </p>
    <p>At 5th level, and again at 10th level, a blackguard may smite good one additional time per day.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Aura of Despair (Su):</strong> Beginning at 3rd level, the blackguard radiates a malign aura that causes
      enemies within 10 feet of him to take a –2 penalty on all saving throws.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Command Undead (Su):</strong> When a blackguard reaches 3rd level, he gains the supernatural ability to
      command and rebuke undead. He commands undead as would a cleric of two levels lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sneak Attack:</strong> This ability, gained at 4th level, is like the rogue ability of the same name. The
      extra damage increases by +1d6 every third level beyond 4th (7th and 10th). If a blackguard gets a sneak attack
      bonus from another source the bonuses on damage stack.
    </p>
    <h3 id="blackguard-spell-list">Blackguard Spell List</h3>
    <p>Blackguards choose their spells from the following list:</p>
    <p>
      1st Level:
      <i>cause fear, corrupt weapon, cure light wounds, doom, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, summon monster I*.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      2nd Level:
      <i
        >bull’s strength, cure moderate wounds, darkness, death knell, eagle’s splendor, inflict moderate wounds,
        shatter, summon monster II*.</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      3rd Level:
      <i
        >contagion, cure serious wounds, deeper darkness, inflict serious wounds, protection from elements, summon
        monster III*.</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      4th Level:
      <i>cure critical wounds, freedom of movement, inflict critical wounds, poison, summon monster IV*.</i>
    </p>
    <p>* Evil creatures only.</p>
    <h3 id="corrupt-weapon">Corrupt Weapon</h3>
    <p>
      Blackguards have access to a special spell, <i>corrupt weapon,</i> which is the opposing counterpart of the
      paladin spell <i>bless weapon</i>. Instead of improving a weapon’s effectiveness against evil foes
      <i>corrupt weapon</i> makes a weapon more effective against good foes.
    </p>
    <h3 id="fallen-paladins">Fallen Paladins</h3>
    <p>
      Blackguards who have levels in the paladin class (that is to say, are now ex-paladins) gain extra abilities the
      more levels of paladin they have.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fallen paladin who becomes a blackguard gains all of the following abilities that apply, according to the number
      of paladin levels the character has.
    </p>
    <p>1–2: Smite good 1/day. (This is in addition to the ability granted to all blackguards at 2nd level.</p>
    <p>
      3–4: Lay on hands. Once per day, the blackguard can use this supernatural ability to cure himself or his fiendish
      servant of damage equal to his Charisma bonus x his level.
    </p>
    <p>5–6: Sneak attack damage increased by +1d6. Smite good 2/day.</p>
    <p>
      7–8: Fiendish summoning. Once per day, the blackguard can use a
      <i>summon monster I</i> spell to call forth an evil creature. For this spell, the caster level is double the
      blackguard’s class level.
    </p>
    <p>
      9–10: Undead companion. In addition to the fiendish servant, the blackguard gains (at 5th level) a Medium-size
      skeleton or zombie as a companion. This companion cannot be turned or rebuked and gains all special bonuses as a
      fiendish servant when the blackguard gains levels. Smite good 3/day.
    </p>
    <p>
      11 or more: A fallen paladin of this stature immediately gains a blackguard level for each level of paladin he
      trades in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character level of the character does not change. With the loss of paladin levels, the character no longer
      gains as many extra abilities for being a fallen paladin.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-blackguards-fiendish-servant">The Blackguard’s Fiendish Servant</h3>
    <p>
      Upon or after reaching 5th level, a blackguard can call a fiendish bat, cat, dire rat, horse, pony, raven, or toad
      to serve him. The blackguard’s servant further gains HD and special abilities based on the blackguard’s character
      level (see the table below).
    </p>
    <p>A blackguard may have only one fiendish servant at a time.</p>
    <p>
      Should the blackguard’s servant die, he may call for another one after a year and a day. The new fiendish servant
      has all the accumulated abilities due a servant of the blackguard’s current level.

    <p>
      <em>Character Level:</em> The character level of the blackguard (his blackguard level plus his original class
      level).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Bonus HD:</em> Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Extra
      Hit Dice improve the servant’s base attack and base save bonuses, as normal.
    </p>
    <p><em>Natural Armor Adj.:</em> This is an improvement to the servant’s existing natural armor bonus.</p>
    <p><em>Str Adj.:</em> Add this figure to the servant’s Strength score.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Int:</em> The servant’s Intelligence score. (A fiendish servant is smarter than normal animals of its kind.)
    </p>
    <p>The abilities mentioned in the “Special” column of the accompanying table are described below.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Empathic Link (Su):</strong> The blackguard has an empathic link with his servant out to a distance of up
      to 1 mile. The blackguard cannot see through the servant’s eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of
      the limited nature of the link, only general emotional content can be communicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the empathic link between the servant and the blackguard, the blackguard has the same connection to a
      place or an item that the servant does.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> If the servant is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex
      saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage on a successful saving throw and only half damage on a failed
      saving throw. Improved evasion is an extraordinary ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Share Saving Throws:</strong> For each of its saving throws, the servant uses either its own base save
      bonus or the blackguard’s, whichever is higher. The servant applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it
      doesn’t share any other bonuses on saves that the blackguard might have.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Share Spells:</strong> At the blackguard’s option, he may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability)
      he casts on himself also affect his servant. The servant must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive
      the benefit. If the spell has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the servant if it moves
      farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the servant again even if the servant returns to the blackguard
      before the duration expires. Additionally, the blackguard may cast a spell with a target of “You” on his servant
      (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself. A blackguard and his servant can share spells even if the spells
      normally do not affect creatures of the servant’s type (magical beast).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Speak with Blackguard (Ex):</strong> If the blackguard’s character level is 13th or higher, the blackguard
      and servant can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand
      the communication without magical help.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Blood Bond (Ex):</strong> If the blackguard’s character level is 16th or higher, the servant gains a +2
      bonus on all attack rolls, checks, and saves if it witnesses the blackguard being threatened or harmed.
    </p>
    <p>This bonus lasts as long as the threat is immediate and apparent.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell Resistance (Ex):</strong> If the blackguard’s character level is 19th or higher, the servant gains
      spell resistance equal to the blackguard’s level + 5. To affect the servant with a spell, another spellcaster must
      get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the servant’s spell resistance.

    <h3 id="dragon-disciple--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are Class Features of the dragon disciple prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Dragon disciples gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Spells:</strong> Dragon disciples gain bonus spells as they gain levels in this prestige class, as
      if from having a high ability score, as given on Table: The Dragon Disciple. A bonus spell can be added to any
      level of spells the disciple already has the ability to cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character has more than one spellcasting class, he must decide to which class he adds each bonus spell as it
      is gained. Once a bonus spell has been applied, it cannot be shifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Natural Armor Increase (Ex):</strong> At 1st, 4th, and 7th level, a gains an increase to the character’s
      existing natural armor (if any), as indicated on Table: The Dragon Disciple (the numbers represent the total
      increase gained to that point). As his skin thickens, a dragon disciple takes on more and more of his progenitor’s
      physical aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Claws and Bite (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a dragon disciple gains claw and bite attacks if he does not
      already have them. Use the values below or the disciple’s base claw and bite damage values, whichever are greater.
    </p>
    <table data-debug="no-caption" class="half-width-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Size</th>
          <th>Bite Damage</th>
          <th>Claw Damage</th>

    </table>
    <p>
      A dragon disciple is considered proficient with these attacks. When making a full attack, a dragon disciple uses
      his full base attack bonus with his bite attack but takes a –5 penalty on claw attacks. The Multiattack feat
      reduces this penalty to only –2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Boost (Ex):</strong> As a dragon disciple gains levels in this prestige class, his ability scores
      increase as noted on Table: The Dragon Disciple.
    </p>
    <p>These increases stack and are gained as if through level advancement.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Breath Weapon (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, a dragon disciple gains a minor breath weapon. The type and
      shape depend on the dragon variety whose heritage he enjoys (see below). Regardless of the ancestor, the breath
      weapon deals 2d8 points of damage of the appropriate energy type.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 7th level, the damage increases to 4d8, and when a disciple attains dragon apotheosis at 10th level it reaches
      its full power at 6d8. Regardless of its strength, the breath weapon can be used only once per day. Use all the
      rules for dragon breath weapons except as specified here.
    </p>
    <p>The DC of the breath weapon is 10 + class level + Con modifier.</p>
    <p>
      A line-shaped breath weapon is 5 feet high, 5 feet wide, and 60 feet long. A cone-shaped breath weapon is 30 feet
      long.

    <p>
      <strong>Blindsense (Ex):</strong> At 5th level, the dragon disciple gains blindsense with a range of 30 feet.
      Using nonvisual senses the dragon disciple notices things it cannot see. He usually does not need to make Spot or
      Listen checks to notice and pinpoint the location of creatures within range of his blindsense ability, provided
      that he has line of effect to that creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any opponent the dragon disciple cannot see still has total concealment against him, and the dragon disciple still
      has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a
      creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against
      attacks from creatures it cannot see. At 10th level, the range of this ability increases to 60 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Wings (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a dragon disciple grows a set of draconic wings. He may now fly at a
      speed equal to his normal land speed, with average maneuverability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dragon Apotheosis:</strong> At 10th level, a dragon disciple takes on the half-dragon template. His breath
      weapon reaches full strength (as noted above), and he gains +4 to Strength and +2 to Charisma. His natural armor
      bonus increases to +4, and he acquires low-light vision, 60-foot darkvision, immunity to <i>sleep</i> and
      paralysis effects, and immunity to the energy type used by his breath weapon (see above).

    <h3 id="duelist--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> The duelist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, but
      no type of armor or shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Canny Defense (Ex):</strong> When not wearing armor or using a shield, a duelist adds 1 point of
      Intelligence bonus (if any) per duelist class level to her Dexterity bonus to modify Armor Class while wielding a
      melee weapon. If a duelist is caught flat-footed or otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus, she also loses this
      bonus.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Improved Reaction (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a duelist gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks.</p>
    <p>
      At 8th level, the bonus increases to +4. This bonus stacks with the benefit provided by the Improved Initiative
      feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Enhanced Mobility (Ex):</strong> When wearing no armor and not using a shield, a duelist gains an
      additional +4 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity caused when she moves out of a threatened square.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Grace (Ex):</strong> At 4th level, a duelist gains an additional +2 competence bonus on all Reflex saving
      throws. This ability functions for a duelist only when she is wearing no armor and not using a shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Precise Strike (Ex):</strong> At 5th level, a duelist gains the ability to strike precisely with a light
      or one-handed piercing weapon, gaining an extra 1d6 damage added to her normal damage roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      When making a precise strike, a duelist cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield. A duelist’s
      precise strike only works against living creatures with discernible anatomies. Any creature that is immune to
      critical hits is not vulnerable to a precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from
      critical hitsalso protects a creature from a precise strike. At 10th level, the extra damage on a precise strike
      increases to +2d6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Acrobatic Charge (Ex):</strong> At 6th level, a duelist gains the ability to charge in situations where
      others cannot. She may charge over difficult terrain that normally slows movement. Depending on the circumstance,
      she may still need to make appropriate checks to successfully move over the terrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Elaborate Parry (Ex):</strong> At 7th level and higher, if a duelist chooses to fight defensively or use
      total defense in melee combat, she gains an additional +1 dodge bonus to AC for each level of duelist she has.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deflect Arrows: At 9th level, a duelist gains the benefit of the Deflect Arrows feat when using a light or
      one-handed piercing weapon.

    <h3 id="dwarven-defender--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are Class Features of the dwarven defender prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>AC Bonus (Ex):</strong> The dwarven defender receives a dodge bonus to Armor Class that starts at +1 and
      improves as the defender gains levels, until it reaches +4 at 10th level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A dwarven defender is proficient with all simple and martial
      weapons, all types of armor, and shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Defensive Stance:</strong> When he adopts a defensive stance, a defender gains phenomenal strength and
      durability, but he cannot move from the spot he is defending. He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2
      resistance bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The increase in Constitution increases the defender’s
      hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the
      Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points
      are. While in a defensive stance, a defender cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shift his
      position. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character’s (newly improved)
      Constitution modifier. A defender may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the
      defensive stance, the defender is winded and takes a –2 penalty to Strength for the duration of that encounter. A
      defender can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level (see
      Table: The Dwarven Defender). Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a defender can only do so
      during his action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> Starting at 2nd level, a dwarven defender retains his Dexterity bonus to AC
      (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity
      bonus to AC if immobilized.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge
      (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Trap Sense (Ex):</strong> At 4th level, a dwarven defender gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid
      traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 8th level, these bonuses rise to +2. These bonuses
      stack with trap sense bonuses gained from other classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Damage Reduction (Ex):</strong> At 6th level, a dwarven defender gains damage reduction. Subtract 3 points
      from the damage the dwarven defender takes each time he is dealt damage. At 10th level, this damage reduction
      rises to 6/–. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> At 6th level, a dwarven defender can no longer be flanked. This
      defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the dwarven defender.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the dwarven defender can flank him
      (and thus sneak attack him).
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class the character automatically gains improved
      uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mobile Defense (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, a dwarven defender can adjust his position while maintaining a
      defensive stance. While in a defensive stance, he can take one 5-foot step each round without losing the benefit
      of the stance.

    <p>All of the following are features of the eldritch knight prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Eldritch knights gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Feat:</strong> At 1st level, an eldritch knight may choose a bonus feat from the list of feats
      available to fighters. This is in addition to the feats that a character of any class normally gets from advancing
      levels. The character must still meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats, including levels of fighter for the
      Weapon Specialization, Greater Weapon Focus, and Greater Weapon Specialization feats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells per Day:</strong> From 2nd level on, when a new eldritch knight level is gained, the character
      gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class she belonged to
      before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would
      have gained. This essentially means that she adds the level of eldritch knight to the level of whatever other
      arcane spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before she became an eldritch knight, she must decide
      to which class she adds each level of eldritch knight for the purpose of determining spells per day.

    <p>
      <em>Blast Infidel (Su):</em> A hierophant can use negative energy spells to their maximum effect on creatures with
      an alignment opposed to the hierophant. (See the table below for a list of which alignments are opposed to each
      alignment.) Any spell with a description that involves inflicting or channeling negative energy cast on a creature
      of the opposed alignment works as if under the effect of a Maximize Spell feat (without using a higher-level spell
      slot). Undead affected by this ability heal the maximized amount of damage.

    <p>
      <em>Divine Reach (Su):</em> A hierophant with this ability can use touch spells on targets up to 30 feet away. If
      the spell requires a melee touch attack, the hierophant must make a ranged touch attack instead. Divine reach can
      be selected a second time as a special ability, in which case the range increases to 60 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Faith Healing (Su):</em> A hierophant can use healing spells to their maximum effect on creatures of the same
      alignment as the hierophant (including the hierophant himself ). Any spell with the healing descriptor cast on
      such creatures works as if under the effects of a Maximize Spell feat (without using a higher-level spell slot).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Gift of the Divine (Su):</em> Available only to hierophants with cleric levels, this ability allows a
      hierophant to transfer one or more uses of his turn undead ability to a willing creature. (Hierophants who rebuke
      undead transfer uses of rebuke undead instead.) The transfer lasts anywhere from 24 hours to one week (chosen at
      the time of transfer), and while the transfer is in effect, the number of turning attempts per day allowed to the
      hierophant is reduced by the number transferred. The recipient turns undead as a cleric of the hierophant’s cleric
      level but uses her own Charisma modifier.

      <em>Mastery of Energy (Su):</em> Available only to hierophants with cleric levels, this ability allows a
      hierophant to channel positive or negative energy much more effectively, increasing his ability to affect undead.
      Add a +4 bonus to the hierophant’s turning checks and turning damage rolls. This ability only affects undead, even
      if the hierophant can turn other creatures, such as with a granted power of a domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Metamagic Feat:</em> A hierophant can choose a metamagic feat in place of one of the special abilities
      described here if desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Power of Nature (Su):</em> Available only to hierophants with druid levels, this ability allows a hierophant
      to temporarily transfer one or more of his druid Class Features to a willing creature. The transfer lasts anywhere
      from 24 hours to one week (chosen at the time of transfer), and while the transfer is in effect, the hierophant
      cannot use the transferred power. He can transfer any of his druid powers except spellcasting and the ability to
      have an animal companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The druid’s wild shape ability can be partially or completely transferred. The heirophant choses how many uses of
      wild shape per day to give to transfer and retains the rest of the uses for himself. If the hierophant can assume
      the form of Tiny or Huge animals, the recipient can as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with the <i>imbue with spell ability</i> spell, the hierophant remains responsible to his deity for any use to
      which the recipient puts the transferred abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Spell Power:</em> This special ability increases a hierophant’s effective caster level by 1 for purposes of
      determining level-dependent spell variables and for caster level checks. This ability can be selected more than
      once, and changes to effective caster level are cumulative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Spell-Like Ability:</em> A hierophant who selects this special ability can use one of his divine spell slots
      to permanently prepare one of his divine spells as a spell-like ability that can be used twice per day. The
      hierophant does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does
      so, and a spell with a costly material component instead costs him 10 times that amount in XP.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell normally uses a spell slot of the spell’s level (or higher, if the hierophant chooses to permanently
      attach a metamagic feat to the spell chosen). The hierophant can use an available higher-level spell slot to use
      the spell-like ability more than once per day. Allocating a slot three levels higher allows him to cast the spell
      four times per day, and a slot six levels higher lets him cast it six times per day. If selected more than one
      time as a special ability, this ability can apply to the same spell (increasing the number of times per day it can
      be used) or to a different spell.

    <h3 id="horizon-walker--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are features of the horizon walker prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Horizon walkers gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Terrain Mastery:</strong> At each level, the Horizon Walker adds a new terrain environment to their
      repertoire from those given below. Terrain mastery gives a horizon walker a bonus on checks involving a skill
      useful in that terrain, or some other appropriate benefit. A horizon walker also knows how to fight dangerous
      creatures typically found in that terrain, gaining a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against
      creatures with that terrain mentioned in the Environment entry of their descriptions. The horizon walker only
      gains the bonus if the creature description specifically lists the terrain type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horizon walkers take their terrain mastery with them wherever they go. They retain their terrain mastery bonuses
      on skill checks, attack rolls, and damage rolls whether they’re actually in the relevant terrain or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Planar Terrain Mastery:</strong> Planar terrain mastery functions just like terrain mastery, except that
      the horizon walker can choose one of the planar categories at each level. The horizon walker can take a non-planar
      terrain type instead, if she wishes.
    </p>
    <h3 id="terrain-mastery-benefits">Terrain Mastery Benefits</h3>

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fiery (Planar):</strong> This kind of planar terrain mastery provides you with resistance to fire 20. You
      gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders and elementals with the fire subtype.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weightless (Planar):</strong> You gain a +30-foot bonus to your fly speed on planes with no gravity or

      your character level) once every 1d4 rounds. You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against
      outsiders and elementals native to a shifting plane.

      You incur none of the penalties for having an alignment at odds with that of the plane, and spells and abilities
      that harm those of the opposite alignment don’t affect you. You have the dominant alignment of the plane with
      regard to magic, but your behavior and any alignment-related Class Features you have are unaffected.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Cavernous (Planar):</strong> You gain tremorsense with a 30-foot range.</p>
    <p><strong>Other (Planar):</strong> If other planes are in use additional Planar Terrains can be created.</p>

    <h3 id="loremaster--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are Class Features of the loremaster prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Loremasters gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells per Day/Spells Known:</strong> When a new loremaster level is gained, the character gains new
      spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she
      belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that
      class would have gained. This essentially means that she adds the level of loremaster to the level of some other
      spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Secret:</strong> At 1st level and every two levels higher than 1st (3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th), the
      loremaster chooses one
    </p>
    <p>
      secret from the table below. Her level plus Intelligence modifier determines the total number of secrets she can
      choose. She can’t choose the same secret twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Lore:</strong> At 2nd level, a loremaster gains the ability to know legends or information regarding
      various topics, just as a bard can with bardic knowledge. The loremaster adds her level and her Intelligence
      modifier to the lore check, which functions otherwise exactly like a bardic knowledge check.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Bonus Languages:</strong> A loremaster can choose any new language at 4th and 8th level.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Greater Lore (Ex):</strong> At 6th level, a loremaster gains the ability to understand magic items, as
      with the <i>identify</i> spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>True Lore (Ex):</strong> At 10th level, once per day a loremaster can use her knowledge to gain the effect
      of a <i>legend lore</i> spell or an <i>analyze dweomer</i> spell.

    <h3 id="mystic-theurge--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are features of the mystic theurge prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Mystic theurges gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells per Day:</strong> When a new mystic theurge level is gained, the character gains new spells per day
      as if he had also gained a level in any one arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige
      class and any one divine spellcasting class he belonged to previously. He does not, however, gain any other
      benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the level of mystic
      theurge to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class and divine spellcasting class the character has,
      then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting
      class or more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a mystic theurge, he must decide to which class
      he adds each level of mystic theurge for the purpose of determining spells per day.

    <h3 id="shadowdancer--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are features of the shadowdancer prestige class.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Shadowdancers are proficient with the club, crossbow (hand, light,
      or heavy), dagger (any type), dart, mace, morningstar, quarterstaff, rapier, sap, shortbow (normal and composite),
      and short sword. Shadowdancers are proficient with light armor but not with shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hide in Plain Sight (Su):</strong> A shadowdancer can use the Hide skill even while being observed. As
      long as she is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, a shadowdancer can hide herself from view in the open
      without anything to actually hide behind. She cannot, however, hide in her own shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a shadowdancer gains evasion. If exposed to any effect that normally
      allows her to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw.
      The evasion ability can only be used if the shadowdancer is wearing light armor or no armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Darkvision (Su):</strong> At 2nd level, a shadowdancer can see in the dark as though she were permanently
      under the effect of a <i>darkvision</i> spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> Starting at 2nd level, a shadowdancer retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if
      any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (She still loses any Dexterity
      bonus to AC if immobilized.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge
      (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Shadow Illusion</i> (Sp):</strong> When a shadowdancer reaches 3rd level, she can create visual
      illusions. This ability’s effect is identical to that of the arcane spell <i>silent image</i> and may be employed
      once per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summon Shadow (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, a shadowdancer can summon a shadow, an undead shade. Unlike a
      normal shadow, this shadow’s alignment matches that of the shadowdancer, and the creature cannot create spawn. The
      summoned shadow cannot be turned, rebuked, or commanded by any third party. This shadow serves as a companion to
      the shadowdancer and can communicate intelligibly with the shadowdancer. Every third level gained by the
      shadowdancer adds +2 HD (and the requisite base attack and base save bonus increases) to her shadow companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a shadow companion is destroyed, or the shadowdancer chooses to dismiss it, the shadowdancer must attempt a DC
      15 Fortitude save. If the saving throw fails, the shadowdancer loses 200 experience points per shadowdancer level.
      A successful saving throw reduces the loss by half, to 100 XP per prestige class level. The shadowdancer’s XP
      total can never go below 0 as the result of a shadow’s dismissal or destruction. A destroyed or dismissed shadow
      companion cannot be replaced for 30 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shadow Jump (Su):</strong> At 4th level, a shadowdancer gains the ability to travel between shadows as if
      by means of a <i>dimension door</i> spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an
      area with at least some shadow. A shadowdancer can jump up to a total of 20 feet each day in this way; this may be
      a single jump of 20 feet or two jumps of 10 feet each. Every two levels higher than 4th, the distance a
      shadowdancer can jump each day doubles (40 feet at 6th, 80 feet at 8th, and 160 feet at 10th). This amount can be
      split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Defensive Roll (Ex):</strong> Starting at 5th level, once per day, when a shadowdancer would be reduced to
      0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), she can
      attempt to roll with the damage. She makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt) and, if successful, takes
      only half damage from the blow. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her
      defensive roll. If she is in a situation that would deny her any Dexterity bonus to AC, she can’t attempt a
      defensive roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> At 5th level, a shadowdancer can no longer be flanked. This defense
      denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the shadowdancer. The exception to this defense is
      that a rogue at least four levels higher than the shadowdancer can flank her (and thus sneak attack her).
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class the character automatically gains improved
      uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Slippery Mind (Ex):</strong> At 7th level, if a shadowdancer is affected by an enchantment and fails her
      saving throw, 1 round later she can attempt her saving throw again. She only gets this one extra chance to succeed
      at her saving throw. If it fails as well, the spell’s effects occur normally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved Evasion (Ex):</strong> This ability, gained at 10th level, works like evasion (see above). A
      shadowdancer takes no damage at all on successful saving throws against attacks that allow a Reflex saving throw
      for half damage. What’s more, she takes only half damage even if she fails her saving throw.
    </p>
    <h2 id="thaumaturgist">Thaumaturgist</h2>
    <p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d4.</p>
    <h3 id="thaumaturgist--requirements">Requirements</h3>
    <p>To qualify to become a thaumaturgist, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.</p>
    <p><strong>Feats:</strong> Spell Focus (conjuration).</p>
    <p><strong>Spells:</strong> Able to cast <i>lesser planar ally</i>.</p>
    <h3 id="thaumaturgist--class-skills">Class Skills</h3>
    <p>
      The thaumaturgist’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int),
      Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis),
      Speak Language (none), and Spellcraft (Int).

    <h3 id="thaumaturgist--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are features of the thaumaturgist prestige class.</p>
    <p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Thaumaturgists gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells per Day:</strong> When a new thaumaturgist level is gained, the character gains new spells per day
      as if he had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class.
      He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means
      that he adds the level of thaumaturgist to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then
      determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he became a thaumaturgist, he must decide to which
      class he adds each level of thaumaturgist for the purpose of determining spells per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved Ally:</strong> When a thaumaturgist casts a <i>planar ally</i> spell (including the
      <i>lesser</i> and <i>greater</i> versions), he makes a Diplomacy check to convince the creature to aid him for a
      reduced payment. If the thaumaturgist’s Diplomacy check adjusts the creature’s attitude to helpful the creature
      will work for 50% of the standard fee, as long as the task is one that is not against its nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thaumaturgist’s improved ally class feature only works when the planar ally shares at least one aspect of
      alignment with the thaumaturgist.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thaumaturgist can have only one such ally at a time, but he may bargain for tasks from other planar allies
      normally.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Augment Summoning:</strong> At 2nd level, a thaumaturgist gains the Augment Summoning feat.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Extended Summoning:</strong> At 3rd level and higher, all spells from the summoning subschool that the
      thaumaturgist casts have their durations doubled, as if the Extend Spell feat had been applied to them. The levels
      of the summoning spells don’t change, however. This ability stacks with the effect of the Extend Spell feat, which
      does change the spell’s level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Contingent Conjuration:</strong> A 4th-level thaumaturgist can prepare a summoning or calling spell ahead
      of time to be triggered by some other event. This functions as described for the <i>contingency</i> spell,
      including having the thaumaturgist cast the summoning or calling spell beforehand. The spell is cast instantly
      when the trigger event occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. If complicated
      or convoluted condition as are prescribed, the contingent conjuration may fail when triggered. The conjuration
      spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether the thaumaturgist wants it to, although
      most conjurations can be dismissed normally. A thaumaturgist can have only one contingent conjuration active at a
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Planar Cohort:</strong> A 5th-level thaumaturgist can use any of the <i>planar ally</i> spells to call a
      creature to act as his cohort. The called creature serves loyally and well as long as the thaumaturgist continues
      to advance a cause important to the creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      To call a planar cohort, the thaumaturgist must cast the relevant spell, paying the XP costs normally. It takes an
      offering of 1,000 gp x the HD of the creature to convince it to serve as a planar cohort, and the improved ally
      class feature can’t be used to reduce or eliminate this cost. The planar cohort can’t have more Hit Dice than the
      thaumaturgist has, and must have an ECL no higher than the thaumaturgist’s character level –2.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thaumaturgist can have only one planar cohort at a time, but he can continue to make agreements with other
      called creatures normally. A planar cohort replaces a thaumaturgist’s existing cohort, if he has one by virtue of
      the Leadership feat.
