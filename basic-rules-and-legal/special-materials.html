    <h1>SPECIAL MATERIALS</h1>
    <p>In addition to magic items created with spells, some substances have innate special properties.</p>
    <p>
      If you make a suit of armor or weapon out of more than one special material, you get the benefit of only the most
      prevalent material. However, you can build a double weapon with each head made of a different special material.
    </p>

    <h2 id="special-weapons-materials">Special Weapons Materials</h2>
    <p>
      Each of the special materials described below has a definite game effect. Some creatures have damage reduction
      based on their creature type or core concept. Some are resistant to all but a special type of damage, such as that
      dealt by evil-aligned weapons or bludgeoning weapons. Others are vulnerable to weapons of a particular material.
      Characters may choose to carry several different types of weapons, depending upon the campaign and types of
      creatures they most commonly encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-weapons-materials--adamantine">Adamantine:</strong> This ultrahard metal adds to the quality
      of a weapon or suit of armor. Weapons fashioned from adamantine have a natural ability to bypass hardness when
      sundering weapons or attacking objects, ignoring hardness less than 20. Armor made from adamantine grants its
      wearer damage reduction of 1/– if it’s light armor, 2/– if it’s medium armor, and 3/– if it’s heavy armor.
      Adamantine is so costly that weapons and armor made from it are always of masterwork quality; the masterwork cost
      is included in the prices given below. Thus, adamantine weapons and ammunition have a +1 enhancement bonus on
      attack rolls, and the armor check penalty of adamantine armor is lessened by 1 compared to ordinary armor of its
      type. Items without metal parts cannot be made from adamantine. An arrow could be made of adamantine, but a
      quarterstaff could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only weapons, armor, and shields normally made of metal can be fashioned from adamantine. Weapons, armor and
      shields normally made of steel that are made of adamantine have one-third more hit points than normal. Adamantine
      has 40 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 20.

    <p>
      <strong id="special-weapons-materials--darkwood">Darkwood:</strong> This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood
      but very light. Any wooden or mostly wooden item (such as a bow, an arrow, or a spear) made from darkwood is
      considered a masterwork item and weighs only half as much as a normal wooden item of that type. Items not normally
      made of wood or only partially of wood (such as a battleaxe or a mace) either cannot be made from darkwood or do
      not gain any special benefit from being made of darkwood. The armor check penalty of a darkwood shield is lessened
      by 2 compared to an ordinary shield of its type. To determine the price of a darkwood item, use the original
      weight but add 10 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item.
    </p>
    <p>Darkwood has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-weapons-materials--dragonhide">Dragonhide:</strong> Armorsmiths can work with the hides of
      dragons to produce armor or shields of masterwork quality. One dragon produces enough hide for a single suit of
      masterwork hide armor for a creature one size category smaller than the dragon. By selecting only choice scales
      and bits of hide, an armorsmith can produce one suit of masterwork banded mail for a creature two sizes smaller,
      one suit of masterwork half-plate for a creature three sizes smaller, or one masterwork breastplate or suit of
      full plate for a creature four sizes smaller. In each case, enough hide is available to produce a small or large
      masterwork shield in addition to the armor, provided that the dragon is Large or larger.
    </p>
    <p>Because dragonhide armor isn’t made of metal, druids can wear it without penalty.</p>
    <p>
      Dragonhide armor costs double what masterwork armor of that type ordinarily costs, but it takes no longer to make
      than ordinary armor of that type.
    </p>
    <p>Dragonhide has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-weapons-materials--iron-cold">Iron, Cold:</strong> This iron, mined deep underground, known
      for its effectiveness against fey creatures, is forged at a lower temperature to preserve its delicate properties.
      Weapons made of cold iron cost twice as much to make as their normal counterparts. Also, any magical enhancements
      cost an additional 2,000 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Items without metal parts cannot be made from cold iron. An arrow could be made of cold iron, but a quarterstaff
      could not.
    </p>
    <p>A double weapon that has only half of it made of cold iron increases its cost by 50%.</p>
    <p>Cold iron has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-weapons-materials--mithral">Mithral:</strong> Mithral is a very rare silvery, glistening metal
      that is lighter than iron but just as hard. When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to
      create armor and is occasionally used for other items as well. Most mithral armors are one category lighter than
      normal for purposes of movement and other limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are
      treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light. Spell failure chances for armors and shields made
      from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 2, and armor check penalties are
      lessened by 3 (to a minimum of 0).
    </p>
    <p>
      An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. In the case of weapons,
      this lighter weight does not change a weapon’s size category or the ease with which it can be wielded (whether it
      is light, one-handed, or two-handed). Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being
      partially made of mithral. (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while a scythe cannot be.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Weapons or armors fashioned from mithral are always masterwork items as well; the masterwork cost is included in
      the prices given below.
    </p>
    <p>Mithral has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 15.</p>

      <strong id="special-weapons-materials--silver-alchemical">Silver, Alchemical:</strong> A complex process involving
      metallurgy and alchemy can bond silver to a weapon made of steel so that it bypasses the damage reduction of
      creatures such as lycanthropes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a successful attack with a silvered weapon, the wielder takes a –1 penalty on the damage roll (with the usual
      minimum of 1 point of damage). The alchemical silvering process can’t be applied to nonmetal items, and it doesn’t
      work on rare metals such as adamantine, cold iron, and mithral.
    </p>
    <p>Alchemical silver has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.</p>
