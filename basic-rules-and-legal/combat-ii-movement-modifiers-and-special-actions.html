      Miniatures are on the 30mm scale—a miniature figure of a six-foot-tall human is approximately 30mm tall. A square
      on the battle grid is 1 inch across, representing a 5-foot-by-5-foot area.

    <h4 id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--how-far-can-your-character-move">
      How Far Can Your Character Move?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Your speed is determined by your race and your armor (see Table: Tactical Speed). Your speed while unarmored is
      your base land speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--how-far-can-your-character-move--encumbrance"
        >Encumbrance:</strong
      >
      A character encumbered by carrying a large amount of gear, treasure, or fallen comrades may move slower than
      normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--how-far-can-your-character-move--hampered-movement"
        >Hampered Movement:</strong
      >
      Difficult terrain, obstacles, or poor visibility can hamper movement.

    <p>
      <strong
        id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--how-far-can-your-character-move--movement-in-combat"
        >Movement in Combat:</strong
      >
      Generally, you can move your speed in a round and still do something (take a move action and a standard action).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do nothing but move (that is, if you use both of your actions in a round to move your speed), you can move
      double your speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you spend the entire round running, you can move quadruple your speed. If you do something that requires a full
      round you can only take a 5-foot step.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--how-far-can-your-character-move--bonuses-to-speed"
        >Bonuses to Speed:</strong
      >
      A barbarian has a +10 foot bonus to his speed (unless he’s wearing heavy armor). Experienced monks also have
      higher speed (unless they’re wearing armor of any sort). In addition, many spells and magic items can affect a
      character’s speed. Always apply any modifiers to a character’s speed before adjusting the character’s speed based
      on armor or encumbrance, and remember that multiple bonuses of the same type to a character’s speed don’t stack.

      When measuring distance, the first diagonal counts as 1 square, the second counts as 2 squares, the third counts
      as 1, the fourth as 2, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can’t move diagonally past a corner (even by taking a 5-foot step). You can move diagonally past a creature,
      even an opponent.

      You can move through a square occupied by a friendly character, unless you are charging. When you move through a
      square occupied by a friendly character, that character doesn’t provide you with cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--moving-through-a-square--opponent"
        >Opponent:</strong
      >
      You can’t move through a square occupied by an opponent, unless the opponent is helpless. You can move through a
      square occupied by a helpless opponent without penalty. (Some creatures, particularly very large ones, may present
      an obstacle even when helpless. In such cases, each square you move through counts as 2 squares.)

      <strong id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--moving-through-a-square--very-small-creature"
        >Very Small Creature:</strong

      A Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creature can move into or through an occupied square. The creature provokes attacks of
      opportunity when doing so.

      <strong

      >
      Any creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories larger than it is.
    </p>
    <p>A big creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories smaller than it is.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--moving-through-a-square--designated-exceptions"
        >Designated Exceptions:</strong
      >
      Some creatures break the above rules. A creature that completely fills the squares it occupies cannot be moved
      past, even with the Tumble skill or similar special abilities.
    </p>
    <h4 id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--terrain-and-obstacles">Terrain and Obstacles</h4>
    <p>
      <strong id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--terrain-and-obstacles--difficult-terrain"
        >Difficult Terrain:</strong
      >
      Difficult terrain hampers movement. Each square of difficult terrain counts as 2 squares of movement. (Each
      diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts as 3 squares.) You can’t run or charge across difficult
      terrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can move only as fast as the most difficult terrain you
      occupy will allow.
    </p>
    <p>Flying and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by difficult terrain.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--terrain-and-obstacles--obstacles"
        >Obstacles:</strong
      >
      Like difficult terrain, obstacles can hamper movement. If an obstacle hampers movement but doesn’t completely
      block it each obstructed square or obstacle between squares counts as 2 squares of movement. You must pay this
      cost to cross the barrier, in addition to the cost to move into the square on the other side. If you don’t have
      sufficient movement to cross the barrier and move into the square on the other side, you can’t cross the barrier.
      Some obstacles may also require a skill check to cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, some obstacles block movement entirely. A character can’t move through a blocking obstacle.
    </p>
    <p>Flying and incorporeal creatures can avoid most obstacles</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--terrain-and-obstacles--squeezing"
        >Squeezing:</strong
      >
      In some cases, you may have to squeeze into or through an area that isn’t as wide as the space you take up. You
      can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. Each move into or through
      a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space you take a –4 penalty on
      attack rolls and a –4 penalty to AC.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a Large creature (which normally takes up four squares) squeezes into a space that’s one square wide, the
      creature’s miniature figure occupies two squares, centered on the line between the two squares. For a bigger
      creature, center the creature likewise in the area it squeezes into.
    </p>
    <p>A creature can squeeze past an opponent while moving but it can’t end its movement in an occupied square.</p>
    <p>
      To squeeze through or into a space less than half your space’s width, you must use the Escape Artist skill. You
      can’t attack while using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space, you take a –4 penalty to AC, and
      you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.
    </p>
    <h4 id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--special-movement-rules">Special Movement Rules</h4>
    <p>These rules cover special movement situations.</p>
    <p>
      <strong
        id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--special-movement-rules--accidentally-ending-movement-in-an-illegal-space"
        >Accidentally Ending Movement in an Illegal Space:</strong
      >
      Sometimes a character ends its movement while moving through a space where it’s not allowed to stop. When that
      happens, put your miniature in the last legal position you occupied, or the closest legal position, if there’s a
      legal position that’s closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--special-movement-rules--double-movement-cost"
        >Double Movement Cost:</strong
      >
      When your movement is hampered in some way, your movement usually costs double. For example, each square of
      movement through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, and each diagonal move through such terrain counts as 3
      squares (just as two diagonal moves normally do).
    </p>
    <p>
      If movement cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as 4 squares (or as 6 squares if moving diagonally). If
      movement cost is doubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if diagonal) and so on. This is an
      exception to the general rule that two doublings are equivalent to a tripling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="movement-position-and-distance--tactical-movement--special-movement-rules--minimum-movement"
        >Minimum Movement:</strong
      >
      Despite penalties to movement, you can take a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even
      diagonally. (This rule doesn’t allow you to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is
      prohibited.) Such movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal (despite the distance covered, this move
      isn’t a 5-foot step).
    </p>
    <h3 id="movement-position-and-distance--big-and-little-creatures-in-combat">Big and Little Creatures in Combat</h3>
    <p>Creatures smaller than Small or larger than Medium have special rules relating to position.</p>
    <p>
      <strong
        id="movement-position-and-distance--big-and-little-creatures-in-combat--tiny-diminutive-and-fine-creatures"
        >Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine Creatures:</strong
      >
      Very small creatures take up less than 1 square of space. This means that more than one such creature can fit into
      a single square. A Tiny creature typically occupies a space only 2-1/2 feet across, so four can fit into a single
      square. Twenty-five Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine creatures can fit into a single square. Creatures that take
      up less than 1 square of space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can’t reach into adjacent
      squares. They must enter an opponent’s square to attack in melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the
      opponent. You can attack into your own square if you need to, so you can attack such creatures normally. Since
      they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the squares around them. You can move past them without provoking
      attacks of opportunity. They also can’t flank an enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        id="movement-position-and-distance--big-and-little-creatures-in-combat--large-huge-gargantuan-and-colossal-creatures"
        >Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures:</strong
      >
      Very large creatures take up more than 1 square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a natural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that they can
      reach targets even if they aren’t in adjacent squares.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike when someone uses a reach weapon, a creature with greater than normal natural reach (more than 5 feet)
      still threatens squares adjacent to it. A creature with greater than normal natural reach usually gets an attack
      of opportunity against you if you approach it, because you must enter and move within the range of its reach
      before you can attack it. (This attack of opportunity is not provoked if you take a 5-foot step.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Large or larger creatures using reach weapons can strike up to double their natural reach but can’t strike at
      their natural reach or less.

    <h3 id="combat-modifiers--cover">Cover</h3>
    <p>
      To determine whether your target has cover from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line
      from this corner to any corner of the target’s square passes through a square or border that blocks line of effect
      or provides cover, or through a square occupied by a creature, the target has cover (+4 to AC).
    </p>
    <p>
      When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has cover if any line from your square to the
      target’s square goes through a wall (including a low wall). When making a melee attack against a target that isn’t
      adjacent to you (such as with a reach weapon), use the rules for determining cover from ranged attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--cover--low-obstacles-and-cover">Low Obstacles and Cover:</strong> A low obstacle
      (such as a wall no higher than half your height) provides cover, but only to creatures within 30 feet (6 squares)
      of it. The attacker can ignore the cover if he’s closer to the obstacle than his target.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--cover--cover-and-attacks-of-opportunity">Cover and Attacks of Opportunity:</strong>
      You can’t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--cover--cover-and-reflex-saves">Cover and Reflex Saves:</strong> Cover grants you a
      +2 bonus on Reflex saves against attacks that originate or burst out from a point on the other side of the cover
      from you. Note that spread effects can extend around corners and thus negate this cover bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--cover--cover-and-hide-checks">Cover and Hide Checks:</strong> You can use cover to
      make a Hide check. Without cover, you usually need concealment (see below) to make a Hide check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--cover--soft-cover">Soft Cover:</strong> Creatures, even your enemies, can provide
      you with cover against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, such soft cover provides no bonus on
      Reflex saves, nor does soft cover allow you to make a Hide check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--cover--big-creatures-and-cover">Big Creatures and Cover:</strong> Any creature with
      a space larger than 5 feet (1 square) determines cover against melee attacks slightly differently than smaller
      creatures do. Such a creature can choose any square that it occupies to determine if an opponent has cover against
      its melee attacks. Similarly, when making a melee attack against such a creature, you can pick any of the squares
      it occupies to determine if it has cover against you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--cover--total-cover">Total Cover:</strong> If you don’t have line of effect to your
      target he is considered to have total cover from you. You can’t make an attack against a target that has total
      cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--cover--varying-degrees-of-cover">Varying Degrees of Cover:</strong> In some cases,
      cover may provide a greater bonus to AC and Reflex saves. In such situations the normal cover bonuses to AC and
      Reflex saves can be doubled (to +8 and +4, respectively). A creature with this improved cover effectively gains
      improved evasion against any attack to which the Reflex save bonus applies. Furthermore, improved cover provides a
      +10 bonus on Hide checks.
    </p>
    <h3 id="combat-modifiers--concealment">Concealment</h3>
    <p>
      To determine whether your target has concealment from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any
      line from this corner to any corner of the target’s square passes through a square or border that provides
      concealment, the target has concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has concealment if his space is entirely within
      an effect that grants concealment. When making a melee attack against a target that isn’t adjacent to you use the
      rules for determining concealment from ranged attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, some magical effects provide concealment against all attacks, regardless of whether any intervening
      concealment exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--concealment--concealment-miss-chance">Concealment Miss Chance:</strong> Concealment
      gives the subject of a successful attack a 20% chance that the attacker missed because of the concealment. If the
      attacker hits, the defender must make a miss chance percentile roll to avoid being struck. Multiple concealment
      conditions do not stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--concealment--concealment-and-hide-checks">Concealment and Hide Checks:</strong> You
      can use concealment to make a Hide check. Without concealment, you usually need cover to make a Hide check.

    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--concealment--total-concealment">Total Concealment:</strong> If you have line of
      effect to a target but not line of sight he is considered to have total concealment from you. You can’t attack an
      opponent that has total concealment, though you can attack into a square that you think he occupies. A successful
      attack into a square occupied by an enemy with total concealment has a 50% miss chance (instead of the normal 20%
      miss chance for an opponent with concealment).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can’t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with total concealment, even if you know what
      square or squares the opponent occupies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--concealment--ignoring-concealment">Ignoring Concealment:</strong> Concealment isn’t
      always effective. A shadowy area or darkness doesn’t provide any concealment against an opponent with darkvision.
      Characters with low-light vision can see clearly for a greater distance with the same light source than other
      characters. Although invisibility provides total concealment, sighted opponents may still make Spot checks to
      notice the location of an invisible character. An invisible character gains a +20 bonus on Hide checks if moving,
      or a +40 bonus on Hide checks when not moving (even though opponents can’t see you, they might be able to figure
      out where you are from other visual clues).

    </p>
    <h3 id="combat-modifiers--flanking">Flanking</h3>
    <p>
      When making a melee attack, you get a +2 flanking bonus if your opponent is threatened by a character or creature
      friendly to you on the opponent’s opposite border or opposite corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      When in doubt about whether two friendly characters flank an opponent in the middle, trace an imaginary line
      between the two friendly characters’ centers. If the line passes through opposite borders of the opponent’s space
      (including corners of those borders), then the opponent is flanked.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="combat-modifiers--flanking--exception">Exception:</em> If a flanker takes up more than 1 square, it gets
      the flanking bonus if any square it occupies counts for flanking.
    </p>
    <p>Only a creature or character that threatens the defender can help an attacker get a flanking bonus.</p>
    <p>Creatures with a reach of 0 feet can’t flank an opponent.</p>
    <h3 id="combat-modifiers--helpless-defenders">Helpless Defenders</h3>
    <p>A helpless opponent is someone who is bound, sleeping, paralyzed, unconscious, or otherwise at your mercy.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--helpless-defenders--regular-attack">Regular Attack:</strong> A helpless character
      takes a –4 penalty to AC against melee attacks, but no penalty to AC against ranged attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A helpless defender can’t use any Dexterity bonus to AC. In fact, his Dexterity score is treated as if it were 0
      and his Dexterity modifier to AC as if it were –5 (and a rogue can sneak attack him).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="combat-modifiers--helpless-defenders--coup-de-grace">Coup de Grace:</strong> As a full-round action,
      you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless opponent. You can also use a bow or crossbow,
      provided you are adjacent to the target.
    </p>
    <p>
      You automatically hit and score a critical hit. If the defender survives the damage, he must make a Fortitude save
      (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. A rogue also gets her extra sneak attack damage against a helpless opponent when
      delivering a coup de grace.
    </p>
    <p>Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents.</p>
    <p>
      You can’t deliver a coup de grace against a creature that is immune to critical hits. You can deliver a coup de
      grace against a creature with total concealment, but doing this requires two consecutive full-round actions (one
      to “find” the creature once you’ve determined what square it’s in, and one to deliver the coup de grace).

    <h3 id="special-attacks--aid-another">Aid Another</h3>
    <p>
      In melee combat, you can help a friend attack or defend by distracting or interfering with an opponent. If you’re
      in position to make a melee attack on an opponent that is engaging a friend in melee combat, you can attempt to
      aid your friend as a standard action. You make an attack roll against AC 10. If you succeed, your friend gains
      either a +2 bonus on his next attack roll against that opponent or a +2 bonus to AC against that opponent’s next
      attack (your choice), as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn. Multiple characters can
      aid the same friend, and similar bonuses stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use this standard action to help a friend in other ways, such as when he is affected by a spell, or
      to assist another character’s skill check.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-attacks--bull-rush">Bull Rush</h3>
    <p>
      You can make a bull rush as a standard action (an attack) or as part of a charge (see Charge, below). When you
      make a bull rush, you attempt to push an opponent straight back instead of damaging him. You can only bull rush an
      opponent who is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--bull-rush--initiating-a-bull-rush">Initiating a Bull Rush:</strong> First, you move
      into the defender’s space. Doing this provokes an attack of opportunity from each opponent that threatens you,
      including the defender. (If you have the Improved Bull Rush feat, you don’t provoke an attack of opportunity from
      the defender.) Any attack of opportunity made by anyone other than the defender against you during a bull rush has
      a 25% chance of accidentally targeting the defender instead, and any attack of opportunity by anyone other than
      you against the defender likewise has a 25% chance of accidentally targeting you. (When someone makes an attack of
      opportunity, make the attack roll and then roll to see whether the attack went astray.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, you and the defender make opposed Strength checks. You each add a +4 bonus for each size category you are
      larger than Medium or a –4 penalty for each size category you are smaller than Medium. You get a +2 bonus if you
      are charging. The defender gets a +4 bonus if he has more than two legs or is otherwise exceptionally stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--bull-rush--bull-rush-results">Bull Rush Results:</strong> If you beat the defender’s
      Strength check result, you push him back 5 feet. If you wish to move with the defender, you can push him back an
      additional 5 feet for each 5 points by which your check result is greater than the defender’s check result. You
      can’t, however, exceed your normal movement limit. (<i>Note:</i> The defender provokes attacks of opportunity if
      he is moved. So do you, if you move with him. The two of you do not provoke attacks of opportunity from each
      other, however.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If you fail to beat the defender’s Strength check result, you move 5 feet straight back to where you were before
      you moved into his space. If that space is occupied, you fall prone in that space.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-attacks--charge">Charge</h3>
    <p>
      Charging is a special full-round action that allows you to move up to twice your speed and attack during the
      action. However, it carries tight restrictions on how you can move.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--charge--movement-during-a-charge">Movement During a Charge:</strong> You must move
      before your attack, not after. You must move at least 10 feet (2 squares) and may move up to double your speed
      directly toward the designated opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must have a clear path toward the opponent, and nothing can hinder your movement (such as difficult terrain or
      obstacles). Here’s what it means to have a clear path. First, you must move to the closest space from which you
      can attack the opponent. (If this space is occupied or otherwise blocked, you can’t charge.) Second, if any line
      from your starting space to the ending space passes through a square that blocks movement, slows movement, or
      contains a creature (even an ally), you can’t charge. (Helpless creatures don’t stop a charge.)
    </p>
    <p>If you don’t have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can’t charge that opponent.</p>
    <p>You can’t take a 5-foot step in the same round as a charge.</p>
    <p>
      If you are able to take only a standard action or a move action on your turn, you can still charge, but you are
      only allowed to move up to your speed (instead of up to double your speed). You can’t use this option unless you
      are restricted to taking only a standard action or move action on your turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--charge--attacking-on-a-charge">Attacking on a Charge:</strong> After moving, you may
      make a single melee attack. You get a +2 bonus on the attack roll. and take a –2 penalty to your AC until the
      start of your next turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      A charging character gets a +2 bonus on the Strength check made to bull rush an opponent (see Bull Rush, above).
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you have extra attacks, such as from having a high enough base attack bonus or from using multiple
      weapons, you only get to make one attack during a charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--charge--lances-and-charge-attacks">Lances and Charge Attacks:</strong> A lance deals
      double damage if employed by a mounted character in a charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--charge--weapons-readied-against-a-charge">Weapons Readied against a Charge:</strong>
      Spears, tridents, and certain other piercing weapons deal double damage when readied (set) and used against a
      charging character.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-attacks--disarm">Disarm</h3>
    <p>
      As a melee attack, you may attempt to disarm your opponent. If you do so with a weapon, you knock the opponent’s
      weapon out of his hands and to the ground. If you attempt the disarm while unarmed, you end up with the weapon in
      your hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re attempting to disarm a melee weapon, follow the steps outlined here. If the item you are attempting to
      disarm isn’t a melee weapon the defender may still oppose you with an attack roll, but takes a penalty and can’t
      attempt to disarm you in return if your attempt fails.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--disarm--step-1">Step 1:</strong> Attack of Opportunity. You provoke an attack of
      opportunity from the target you are trying to disarm. (If you have the Improved Disarm feat, you don’t incur an
      attack of opportunity for making a disarm attempt.) If the defender’s attack of opportunity deals any damage, your
      disarm attempt fails.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--disarm--step-2">Step 2:</strong> Opposed Rolls. You and the defender make opposed
      attack rolls with your respective weapons. The wielder of a two-handed weapon on a disarm attempt gets a +4 bonus
      on this roll, and the wielder of a light weapon takes a –4 penalty. (An unarmed strike is considered a light
      weapon, so you always take a penalty when trying to disarm an opponent by using an unarmed strike.) If the
      combatants are of different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the attack roll of +4 per difference in
      size category. If the targeted item isn’t a melee weapon, the defender takes a –4 penalty on the roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--disarm--step-three">Step Three:</strong> Consequences. If you beat the defender, the
      defender is disarmed. If you attempted the disarm action unarmed, you now have the weapon. If you were armed, the
      defender’s weapon is on the ground in the defender’s square.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you fail on the disarm attempt, the defender may immediately react and attempt to disarm you with the same sort
      of opposed melee attack roll. His attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from you. If he fails his
      disarm attempt, you do not subsequently get a free disarm attempt against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="special-attacks--disarm--step-three--note">Note:</em> A defender wearing spiked gauntlets can’t be
      disarmed. A defender using a weapon attached to a locked gauntlet gets a +10 bonus to resist being disarmed.
    </p>
    <h4 id="special-attacks--disarm--grabbing-items">Grabbing Items</h4>
    <p>
      You can use a disarm action to snatch an item worn by the target. If you want to have the item in your hand, the
      disarm must be made as an unarmed attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the item is poorly secured or otherwise easy to snatch or cut away the attacker gets a +4 bonus. Unlike on a
      normal disarm attempt, failing the attempt doesn’t allow the defender to attempt to disarm you. This otherwise
      functions identically to a disarm attempt, as noted above.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can’t snatch an item that is well secured unless you have pinned the wearer (see Grapple). Even then, the
      defender gains a +4 bonus on his roll to resist the attempt.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-attacks--feint">Feint</h3>
    <p>
      Feinting is a standard action. To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by a Sense Motive check by your target. The
      target may add his base attack bonus to this Sense Motive check. If your Bluff check result exceeds your target’s
      Sense Motive check result, the next melee attack you make against the target does not allow him to use his
      Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). This attack must be made on or before your next turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      When feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid you take a –4 penalty. Against a creature of animal Intelligence
      (1 or 2), you take a –8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it’s impossible.
    </p>
    <p>Feinting in combat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--feint--feinting-as-a-move-action">Feinting as a Move Action:</strong> With the
      Improved Feint feat, you can attempt a feint as a move action instead of as a standard action.

    <h3 id="special-attacks--grapple">Grapple</h3>
    <h4 id="special-attacks--grapple--grapple-checks">Grapple Checks</h4>
    <p>
      Repeatedly in a grapple, you need to make opposed grapple checks against an opponent. A grapple check is like a
      melee attack roll. Your attack bonus on a grapple check is: Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + special size
      modifier
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--grapple--grapple-checks--special-size-modifier">Special Size Modifier:</strong> The
      special size modifier for a grapple check is as follows: Colossal +16, Gargantuan +12, Huge +8, Large +4, Medium
      +0, Small –4, Tiny –8, Diminutive –12, Fine –16. Use this number in place of the normal size modifier you use when
      making an attack roll.
    </p>
    <h4 id="special-attacks--grapple--starting-a-grapple">Starting a Grapple</h4>
    <p>
      To start a grapple, you need to grab and hold your target. Starting a grapple requires a successful melee attack
      roll. If you get multiple attacks, you can attempt to start a grapple multiple times (at successively lower base
      attack bonuses).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--grapple--starting-a-grapple--step-1">Step 1:</strong> Attack of Opportunity. You
      provoke an attack of opportunity from the target you are trying to grapple. If the attack of opportunity deals
      damage, the grapple attempt fails. (Certain monsters do not provoke attacks of opportunity when they attempt to
      grapple, nor do characters with the Improved Grapple feat.) If the attack of opportunity misses or fails to deal
      damage, proceed to Step 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--grapple--starting-a-grapple--step-2">Step 2:</strong> Grab. You make a melee touch
      attack to grab the target. If you fail to hit the target, the grapple attempt fails. If you succeed, proceed to
      Step 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--grapple--starting-a-grapple--step-3">Step 3:</strong> Hold. Make an opposed grapple
      check as a free action.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you succeed, you and your target are now grappling, and you deal damage to the target as if with an unarmed
      strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you lose, you fail to start the grapple. You automatically lose an attempt to hold if the target is two or more
      size categories larger than you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case of a tie, the combatant with the higher grapple check modifier wins. If this is a tie, roll again to break
      the tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--grapple--starting-a-grapple--step-4">Step 4:</strong> Maintain Grapple. To maintain
      the grapple for later rounds, you must move into the target’s space. (This movement is free and doesn’t count as
      part of your movement in the round.)
    </p>
    <p>Moving, as normal, provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents, but not from your target.</p>
    <p>
      If you can’t move into your target’s space, you can’t maintain the grapple and must immediately let go of the
      target. To grapple again, you must begin at Step 1.

    <h4 id="special-attacks--grapple--grappling-consequences">Grappling Consequences</h4>

    <p>
      When you are grappling (regardless of who started the grapple), you can perform any of the following actions. Some
      of these actions take the place of an attack (rather than being a standard action or a move action). If your base
      attack bonus allows you multiple attacks, you can attempt one of these actions in place of each of your attacks,
      but at successively lower base attack bonuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--grapple--if-youre-grappling--activate-a-magic-item">Activate a Magic Item:</strong>
      You can activate a magic item, as long as the item doesn’t require a spell completion trigger. You don’t need to
      make a grapple check to activate the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--grapple--if-youre-grappling--attack-your-opponent">Attack Your Opponent:</strong> You
      can make an attack with an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or light weapon against another character you are
      grappling. You take a –4 penalty on such attacks.
    </p>
    <p>You can’t attack with two weapons while grappling, even if both are light weapons.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--grapple--if-youre-grappling--cast-a-spell">Cast a Spell:</strong> You can attempt to
      cast a spell while grappling or even while pinned (see below), provided its casting time is no more than 1
      standard action, it has no somatic component, and you have in hand any material components or focuses you might
      need. Any spell that requires precise and careful actionis impossible to cast while grappling or being pinned. If
      the spell is one that you can cast while grappling, you must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or
      lose the spell. You don’t have to make a successful grapple check to cast the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--grapple--if-youre-grappling--damage-your-opponent">Damage Your Opponent:</strong>
      While grappling, you can deal damage to your opponent equivalent to an unarmed strike. Make an opposed grapple
      check in place of an attack. If you win, you deal nonlethal damage as normal for your unarmed strike (1d3 points
      for Medium attackers or 1d2 points for Small attackers, plus Strength modifiers). If you want to deal lethal
      damage, you take a –4 penalty on your grapple check.

      <strong id="special-attacks--grapple--if-youre-grappling--escape-from-grapple">Escape from Grapple:</strong> You
      can escape a grapple by winning an opposed grapple check in place of making an attack. You can make an Escape
      Artist check in place of your grapple check if you so desire, but this requires a standard action. If more than
      one opponent is grappling you, your grapple check result has to beat all their individual check results to escape.
      (Opponents don’t have to try to hold you if they don’t want to.) If you escape, you finish the action by moving
      into any space adjacent to your opponent(s).

    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--grapple--if-youre-grappling--move">Move:</strong> You can move half your speed

      <strong id="special-attacks--grapple--if-youre-grappling--pin-your-opponent">Pin Your Opponent:</strong> You can
      hold your opponent immobile for 1 round by winning an opposed grapple check (made in place of an attack). Once you

      a pinned opponent from speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use a disarm action to remove or grab away a well secured object worn by a pinned opponent, but he gets a
      +4 bonus on his roll to resist your attempt (see Disarm).
    </p>
    <p>
      You may voluntarily release a pinned character as a free action; if you do so, you are no longer considered to be
      grappling that character (and vice versa).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can’t draw or use a weapon (against the pinned character or any other character), escape another’s grapple,

    <h4 id="special-attacks--grapple--if-youre-pinned-by-an-opponent">If You’re Pinned by an Opponent</h4>
    <p>
      When an opponent has pinned you, you are held immobile (but not helpless) for 1 round. While you’re pinned, you
      take a –4 penalty to your AC against opponents other than the one pinning you. At your opponent’s option, you may
      also be unable to speak. On your turn, you can try to escape the pin by making an opposed grapple check in place
      of an attack. You can make an Escape Artist check in place of your grapple check if you want, but this requires a
      standard action. If you win, you escape the pin, but you’re still grappling.

    <h4 id="special-attacks--grapple--joining-a-grapple">Joining a Grapple</h4>
    <p>
      If your target is already grappling someone else, you can use an attack to start a grapple, as above, except that
      the target doesn’t get an attack of opportunity against you, and your grab automatically succeeds. You still have
      to make a successful opposed grapple check to become part of the grapple.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are multiple opponents involved in the grapple, you pick one to make the opposed grapple check against.
    </p>
    <h4 id="special-attacks--grapple--multiple-grapplers">Multiple Grapplers</h4>
    <p>
      Several combatants can be in a single grapple. Up to four combatants can grapple a single opponent in a given

      category larger than you count double, and creatures two or more size categories larger count quadruple.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are grappling with multiple opponents, you choose one opponent to make an opposed check against. The

    </p>
    <p>
      When you attack a creature smaller than your mount that is on foot, you get the +1 bonus on melee attacks for
      being on higher ground. If your mount moves more than 5 feet, you can only make a single melee attack.
      Essentially, you have to wait until the mount gets to your enemy before attacking, so you can’t make a full
      attack. Even at your mount’s full speed, you don’t take any penalty on melee attacks while mounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your mount charges, you also take the AC penalty associated with a charge. If you make an attack at the end of
      the charge, you receive the bonus gained from the charge. When charging on horseback, you deal double damage with
      a lance (see Charge).
    </p>

      You can use ranged weapons while your mount is taking a double move, but at a –4 penalty on the attack roll. You

      If you have your mount move both before and after you cast a spell, then you’re casting the spell while the mount
      is moving, and you have to make a Concentration check due to the vigorous motion (DC 10 + spell level) or lose the
      spell. If the mount is running (quadruple speed), you can cast a spell when your mount has moved up to twice its

      penalty for every size category he is smaller than Medium. The defender gets a +4 bonus on his check if he has
      more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal humanoid. If you win, you knock the defender prone.
      If you lose, the defender may immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or Strength

      <strong id="special-attacks--sunder--step-1">Step 1:</strong> Attack of Opportunity. You provoke an attack of

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--sunder--step-2">Step 2:</strong> Opposed Rolls. You and the defender make opposed
      attack rolls with your respective weapons. The wielder of a two-handed weapon on a sunder attempt gets a +4 bonus
      on this roll, and the wielder of a light weapon takes a –4 penalty. If the combatants are of different sizes, the
      larger combatant gets a bonus on the attack roll of +4 per difference in size category.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--sunder--step-3">Step 3:</strong> Consequences. If you beat the defender, roll damage
      and deal it to the weapon or shield. See Table: Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield Hardness and Hit Points to

        >Sundering a Carried or Worn Object:</em
      >
      You don’t use an opposed attack roll to damage a carried or worn object. Instead, just make an attack roll against
      the object’s AC. A carried or worn object’s AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier + the Dexterity modifier of the
      carrying or wearing character. Attacking a carried or worn object provokes an attack of opportunity just as
      attacking a held object does. To attempt to snatch away an item worn by a defender rather than damage it, see
      Disarm. You can’t sunder armor worn by another character.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-attacks--throw-splash-weapon">Throw Splash Weapon</h3>
    <p>
      A splash weapon is a ranged weapon that breaks on impact, splashing or scattering its contents over its target and
      nearby creatures or objects. To attack with a splash weapon, make a ranged touch attack against the target. Thrown
      weapons require no weapon proficiency, so you don’t take the –4 nonproficiency penalty. A hit deals direct hit
      damage to the target, and splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can instead target a specific grid intersection. Treat this as a ranged attack against AC 5. However, if you
      target a grid intersection, creatures in all adjacent squares are dealt the splash damage, and the direct hit
      damage is not dealt to any creature. (You can’t target a grid intersection occupied by a creature, such as a Large
      or larger creature; in this case, you’re aiming at the creature.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If you miss the target (whether aiming at a creature or a grid intersection), roll 1d8. This determines the
      misdirection of the throw, with 1 being straight back at you and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the grid
      intersection or target creature. Then, count a number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the range
      increment of the throw.
    </p>
    <p>After you determine where the weapon landed, it deals splash damage to all creatures in adjacent squares.</p>
    <h3 id="special-attacks--trip">Trip</h3>
    <p>
      You can try to trip an opponent as an unarmed melee attack. You can only trip an opponent who is one size category
      larger than you, the same size, or smaller.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--trip--making-a-trip-attack">Making a Trip Attack:</strong> Make an unarmed melee

    </p>
    <p>
      If your attack succeeds, make a Strength check opposed by the defender’s Dexterity or Strength check (whichever
      ability score has the higher modifier). A combatant gets a +4 bonus for every size category he is larger than
      Medium or a –4 penalty for every size category he is smaller than Medium. The defender gets a +4 bonus on his
      check if he has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal humanoid. If you win, you trip the
      defender. If you lose, the defender may immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or
      Strength check to try to trip you.

    <h3 id="special-attacks--turn-or-rebuke-undead">Turn or Rebuke Undead</h3>
    <p>
      Good clerics and paladins and some neutral clerics can channel positive energy, which can halt, drive off (rout),
      or destroy undead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evil clerics and some neutral clerics can channel negative energy, which can halt, awe (rebuke), control
      (command), or bolster undead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the effect, the general term for the activity is “turning.” When attempting to exercise their divine
      control over these creatures, characters make turning checks.
    </p>
    <h4 id="special-attacks--turn-or-rebuke-undead--turning-checks">Turning Checks</h4>
    <p>
      Turning undead is a supernatural ability that a character can perform as a standard action. It does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>You must present your holy symbol to turn undead. Turning is considered an attack.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--turn-or-rebuke-undead--turning-checks--times-per-day">Times per Day:</strong> You may
      attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You can increase this number
      by taking the Extra Turning feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--turn-or-rebuke-undead--turning-checks--range">Range:</strong> You turn the closest
      turnable undead first, and you can’t turn undead that are more than 60 feet away or that have total cover relative
      to you. You don’t need line of sight to a target, but you do need line of effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--turn-or-rebuke-undead--turning-checks--turning-check">Turning Check:</strong> The
      first thing you do is roll a turning check to see how powerful an undead creature you can turn. This is a Charisma
      check (1d20 + your Charisma modifier). Table: Turning Undead gives you the Hit Dice of the most powerful undead
      you can affect, relative to your level. On a given turning attempt, you can turn no undead creature whose Hit Dice
      exceed the result on this table.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--turn-or-rebuke-undead--turning-checks--turning-damage">Turning Damage:</strong> If
      your roll on Table: Turning Undead is high enough to let you turn at least some of the undead within 60 feet, roll
      2d6 + your cleric level + your Charisma modifier for turning damage. That’s how many total Hit Dice of undead you
      can turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your Charisma score is average or low, it’s possible to roll fewer Hit Dice of undead turned than indicated on
      Table: Turning Undead.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may skip over already turned undead that are still within range, so that you do not waste your turning
      capacity on them.

      <strong id="special-attacks--turn-or-rebuke-undead--turning-checks--effect-and-duration-of-turning"
        >Effect and Duration of Turning:</strong
      >
      Turned undead flee from you by the best and fastest means available to them. They flee for 10 rounds (1 minute).
      If they cannot flee, they cower (giving any attack rolls against them a +2 bonus). If you approach within 10 feet
      of them, however, they overcome being turned and act normally. (You can stand within 10 feet without breaking the
      turning effect—you just can’t approach them.) You can attack them with ranged attacks (from at least 10 feet
      away), and others can attack them in any fashion, without breaking the turning effect.

    <p>
      Evil clerics channel negative energy to rebuke (awe) or command (control) undead rather than channeling positive
      energy to turn or destroy them. An evil cleric makes the equivalent of a turning check. Undead that would be
      turned are rebuked instead, and those that would be destroyed are commanded.

      <strong id="special-attacks--turn-or-rebuke-undead--evil-clerics-and-undead--rebuked">Rebuked:</strong> A rebuked

    <p>
      <strong id="special-attacks--turn-or-rebuke-undead--evil-clerics-and-undead--commanded">Commanded:</strong> A
      commanded undead creature is under the mental control of the evil cleric. The cleric must take a standard action
      to give mental orders to a commanded undead. At any one time, the cleric may command any number of undead whose
      total Hit Dice do not exceed his level. He may voluntarily relinquish command on any commanded undead creature or
      creatures in order to command new ones.

      <strong id="special-attacks--turn-or-rebuke-undead--evil-clerics-and-undead--dispelling-turning"
        >Dispelling Turning:</strong
      >
      An evil cleric may channel negative energy to dispel a good cleric’s turning effect. The evil cleric makes a
      turning check as if attempting to rebuke the undead. If the turning check result is equal to or greater than the
      turning check result that the good cleric scored when turning the undead, then the undead are no longer turned.
      The evil cleric rolls turning damage of 2d6 + cleric level + Charisma modifier to see how many Hit Dice worth of
      undead he can affect in this way (as if he were rebuking them).

        >Bolstering Undead:</strong
      >
      An evil cleric may also bolster undead creatures against turning in advance. He makes a turning check as if
      attempting to rebuke the undead, but the Hit Dice result on Table: Turning Undead becomes the undead creatures’
      effective Hit Dice as far as turning is concerned (provided the result is higher than the creatures’ actual Hit
      Dice). The bolstering lasts 10 rounds. An evil undead cleric can bolster himself in this manner.

      a –6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a –10 penalty to the attack with your
      off hand when you fight this way. You can reduce these penalties in two ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. (An unarmed strike is always considered

    <h3 id="special-initiative-actions--delay">Delay</h3>
    <p>
      By choosing to delay, you take no action and then act normally on whatever initiative count you decide to act.
      When you delay, you voluntarily reduce your own initiative result for the rest of the combat. When your new, lower
      initiative count comes up later in the same round, you can act normally. You can specify this new initiative
      result or just wait until some time later in the round and act then, thus fixing your new initiative count at that
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      You never get back the time you spend waiting to see what’s going to happen. You can’t, however, interrupt anyone
      else’s action (as you can with a readied action).

    <p>
      <strong id="special-initiative-actions--delay--initiative-consequences-of-delaying"
        >Initiative Consequences of Delaying:</strong

      Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the delayed action. If you come to your next action and
      have not yet performed an action, you don’t get to take a delayed action (though you can delay again).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you take a delayed action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to
      that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-initiative-actions--ready">Ready</h3>
    <p>
      The ready action lets you prepare to take an action later, after your turn is over but before your next one has
      begun. Readying is a standard action. It does not provoke an attack of opportunity (though the action that you
      ready might do so).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-initiative-actions--ready--readying-an-action">Readying an Action:</strong> You can ready a
      standard action, a move action, or a free action. To do so, specify the action you will take and the conditions
      under which you will take it. Then, any time before your next action, you may take the readied action in response
      to that condition. The action occurs just before the action that triggers it. If the triggered action is part of
      another character’s activities, you interrupt the other character. Assuming he is still capable of doing so, he
      continues his actions once you complete your readied action. Your initiative result changes. For the rest of the
      encounter, your initiative result is the count on which you took the readied action, and you act immediately ahead
      of the character whose action triggered your readied action.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can take a 5-foot step as part of your readied action, but only if you don’t otherwise move any distance
      during the round.

      Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the readied action. If you come to your next action and
      have not yet performed your readied action, you don’t get to take the readied action (though you can ready the
      same action again). If you take your readied action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, your
      initiative count rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that
