    <h1>PLANES</h1>

    <h2 id="what-is-a-plane">What Is a Plane?</h2>
    <p>
      The planes of existence are different realities with interwoven connections. Except for rare linking points, each
      plane is effectively its own universe with its own natural laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      The planes break down into a number of general types: the Material Plane, the Transitive Planes, the Inner Planes,
      the Outer Planes, and the demiplanes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="what-is-a-plane--material-plane">Material Plane:</strong> The Material Plane tends to be the most
      Earthlike of all planes and operates under the same set of natural laws that our own real world does. This is the
      default plane for most adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="what-is-a-plane--transitive-planes">Transitive Planes:</strong> These three planes have one important
      common characteristic: Each is used to get from one place to another. The Astral Plane is a conduit to all other
      planes, while the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow both serve as means of transportation within the Material
      Plane they’re connected to. These planes have the strongest regular interaction with the Material Plane and are
      often accessed by using various spells. They have native inhabitants as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="what-is-a-plane--inner-planes">Inner Planes:</strong> These six planes are manifestations of the basic
      building blocks of the universe. Each is made up of a single type of energy or element that overwhelms all others.
      The natives of a particular Inner Plane are made of the same energy or element as the plane itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="what-is-a-plane--outer-planes">Outer Planes:</strong> The deities live on the Outer Planes, as do
      creatures such as celestials, demons, and devils. Each of the Outer Planes has an alignment, representing a
      particular moral or ethical outlook, and the natives of each plane tend to behave in agreement with that plane’s
      alignment. The Outer Planes are also the final resting place of souls from the Material Plane, whether that final
      rest takes the form of calm introspection or eternal damnation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="what-is-a-plane--demiplanes">Demiplanes:</strong> This catch-all category covers all extradimensional
      spaces that function like planes but have measurable size and limited access. Other kinds of planes are
      theoretically infinite in size, but a demiplane might be only a few hundred feet across.
    </p>
    <h2 id="planar-traits">Planar Traits</h2>
    <p>Each plane of existence has its own properties—the natural laws of its universe.</p>
    <p>Planar traits are broken down into a number of general areas.</p>
    <p>All planes have the following kinds of traits.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="planar-traits--physical-traits">Physical Traits:</strong> These traits determine the laws of physics
      and nature on the plane, including how gravity and time function.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="planar-traits--elemental-and-energy-traits">Elemental and Energy Traits:</strong> These traits
      determine the dominance of particular elemental or energy forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="planar-traits--alignment-traits">Alignment Traits:</strong> Just as characters may be lawful neutral
      or chaotic good, many planes are tied to a particular moral or ethical outlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="planar-traits--magic-traits">Magic Traits:</strong> Magic works differently from plane to plane, and
      magic traits set the boundaries for what it can and can’t do.
    </p>
    <h2 id="physical-traits">Physical Traits</h2>
    <p>
      The two most important natural laws set by physical traits are how gravity works and how time passes. Other
      physical traits pertain to the size and shape of a plane and how easily a plane’s nature can be altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="physical-traits--gravity">Gravity:</strong> The direction of gravity’s pull may be unusual, and it
      might even change directions within the plane itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--gravity--normal-gravity">Normal Gravity:</em> Most planes have gravity similar to that of
      the Material Plane. The usual rules for ability scores, carrying capacity, and encumbrance apply. Unless otherwise
      noted in a description, it is assumed every plane has the normal gravity trait.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--gravity--heavy-gravity">Heavy Gravity:</em> The gravity on a plane with this trait is
      much more intense than on the Material Plane. As a result, Balance, Climb, Jump, Ride, Swim, and Tumble checks
      incur a –2 circumstance penalty, as do all attack rolls. All item weights are effectively doubled, which might
      affect a character’s speed. Weapon ranges are halved. A character’s Strength and Dexterity scores are not
      affected. Characters who fall on a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points of damage for each 10 feet fallen, to a
      maximum of 20d10 points of damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--gravity--light-gravity">Light Gravity:</em> The gravity on a plane with this trait is
      less intense than on the Material Plane. As a result, creatures find that they can lift more, but their movements
      tend to be ungainly. Characters on a plane with the light gravity trait take a –2 circumstance penalty on attack
      rolls and Balance, Ride, Swim, and Tumble checks. All items weigh half as much. Weapon ranges double, and
      characters gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb and Jump checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strength and Dexterity don’t change as a result of light gravity, but what you can do with such scores does
      change. These advantages apply to travelers from other planes as well as natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Falling characters on a light gravity plane take 1d4 points of damage for each 10 feet of the fall (maximum 20d4).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--gravity--no-gravity">No Gravity:</em> Individuals on a plane with this trait merely float
      in space, unless other resources are available to provide a direction for gravity’s pull.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--gravity--objective-directional-gravity">Objective Directional Gravity:</em> The strength
      of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the Material Plane, but the direction is not the
      traditional “down” toward the ground. It may be down toward any solid object, at an angle to the surface of the
      plane itself, or even upward.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, objective directional gravity may change from place to place. The direction of “down” may vary.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--gravity--subjective-directional-gravity">Subjective Directional Gravity:</em> The
      strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the Material Plane, but each individual chooses
      the direction of gravity’s pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects and nonsentient creatures.
      This sort of environment can be very disorienting to the newcomer, but is common on “weightless” planes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters on a plane with subjective directional gravity can move normally along a solid surface by imagining
      “down” near their feet. If suspended in midair, a character “flies” by merely choosing a “down” direction and
      “falling” that way. Under such a procedure, an individual “falls” 150 feet in the first round and 300 feet in each
      succeeding round. Movement is straight-line only. In order to stop, one has to slow one’s movement by changing the
      designated “down” direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and 300 feet per round
      thereafter).
    </p>
    <p>
      It takes a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action; this check can be made once per
      round. Any character who fails this Wisdom check in successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks
      until he or she succeeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="physical-traits--time">Time:</strong> The rate of time’s passage can vary on different planes, though
      it remains constant within any particular plane. Time is always subjective for the viewer. The same subjectivity
      applies to various planes. Travelers may discover that they’ll pick up or lose time while moving among the planes,
      but from their point of view, time always passes naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--time--normal-time">Normal Time:</em> This trait describes the way time passes on the
      Material Plane. One hour on a plane with normal time equals one hour on the Material Plane. Unless otherwise noted
      in a description, every plane has the normal time trait.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--time--timeless">Timeless:</em> On planes with this trait, time still passes, but the
      effects of time are diminished. How the timeless trait can affect certain activities or conditions such as hunger,
      thirst, aging, the effects of poison, and healing varies from plane to plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The danger of a timeless plane is that once one leaves such a plane for one where time flows normally, conditions
      such as hunger and aging do occur retroactively.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--time--flowing-time">Flowing Time:</em> On some planes, time can flow faster or slower.
      One may travel to another plane, spend a year there, then return to the Material Plane to find that only six
      seconds have elapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only a few seconds older. But for that traveler and
      the items, spells, and effects working on him, that year away was entirely real.
    </p>
    <p>
      When designating how time works on planes with flowing time, put the Material Plane’s flow of time first, followed
      by the same flow in the other plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--time--erratic-time">Erratic Time:</em> Some planes have time that slows down and speeds
      up, so an individual may lose or gain time as he moves between the two planes. The following is provided as an
      example.
    </p>
    <table data-debug="no-caption" class="half-width-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>d%</th>
          <th>Time on Material Plane</th>
          <th>Time on Erratic Time Plane</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>01–10</td>
          <td>1 day</td>
          <td>1 round</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>11–40</td>
          <td>1 day</td>
          <td>1 hour</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>41–60</td>
          <td>1 day</td>
          <td>1 day</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>61–90</td>
          <td>1 hour</td>
          <td>1 day</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>91–100</td>
          <td>1 round</td>
          <td>1 day</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>To the denizens of such a plane, time flows naturally and the shift is unnoticed.</p>
    <p>
      If a plane is timeless with respect to magic, any spell cast with a noninstantaneous duration is permanent until
      dispelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="physical-traits--shape-and-size">Shape and Size:</strong> Planes come in a variety of sizes and
      shapes. Most planes are infinite, or at least so large that they may as well be infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--shape-and-size--infinite">Infinite:</em> Planes with this trait go on forever, though
      they may have finite components within them. Or they may consist of ongoing expanses in two directions, like a map
      that stretches out infinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--shape-and-size--finite-shape">Finite Shape:</em> A plane with this trait has defined
      edges or borders. These borders may adjoin other planes or hard, finite borders such as the edge of the world or a
      great wall. Demiplanes are often finite.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--shape-and-size--self-contained-shape">Self-Contained Shape:</em> On planes with this
      trait, the borders wrap in on themselves, depositing the traveler on the other side of the map. A spherical plane
      is an example of a self-contained, finite plane, but there can be cubes, toruses, and flat planes with magical
      edges that teleport the traveler to an opposite edge when he crosses them.
    </p>
    <p>Some demiplanes are self-contained.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="physical-traits--morphic-traits">Morphic Traits:</strong> This trait measures how easily the basic
      nature of a plane can be changed. Some planes are responsive to sentient thought, while others can be manipulated
      only by extremely powerful creatures. And some planes respond to physical or magical efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--morphic-traits--alterable-morphic">Alterable Morphic:</em> On a plane with this trait,
      objects remain where they are (and what they are) unless affected by physical force or magic. You can change the
      immediate environment as a result of tangible effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--morphic-traits--highly-morphic">Highly Morphic:</em> On a plane with this trait, features
      of the plane change so frequently that it’s difficult to keep a particular area stable. Such planes may react
      dramatically to specific spells, sentient thought, or the force of will. Others change for no reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--morphic-traits--magically-morphic">Magically Morphic:</em> Specific spells can alter the
      basic material of a plane with this trait.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--morphic-traits--divinely-morphic">Divinely Morphic:</em> Specific unique beings (deities
      or similar great powers) have the ability to alter objects, creatures, and the landscape on planes with this
      trait. Ordinary characters find these planes similar to alterable planes in that they may be affected by spells
      and physical effort. But the deities may cause these areas to change instantly and dramatically, creating great
      kingdoms for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--morphic-traits--static">Static:</em> These planes are unchanging. Visitors cannot affect
      living residents of the plane, nor objects that the denizens possess. Any spells that would affect those on the
      plane have no effect unless the plane’s static trait is somehow removed or suppressed. Spells cast before entering
      a plane with the static trait remain in effect, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even moving an unattended object within a static plane requires a DC 16 Strength check. Particularly heavy objects
      may be impossible to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="physical-traits--morphic-traits--sentient">Sentient:</em> These planes are ones that respond to a single
      thought— that of the plane itself. Travelers would find the plane’s landscape changing as a result of what the
      plane thought of the travelers, either becoming more or less hospitable depending on its reaction.
    </p>
    <h2 id="elemental-and-energy-traits">Elemental and Energy Traits</h2>
    <p>
      Four basic elements and two types of energy together make up everything. The elements are earth, air, fire, and
      water. The types of energy are positive and negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Material Plane reflects a balancing of those elements and energies; all are found there. Each of the Inner
      Planes is dominated by one element or type of energy. Other planes may show off various aspects of these elemental
      traits. Many planes have no elemental or energy traits; these traits are noted in a plane’s description only when
      they are present.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="elemental-and-energy-traits--air-dominant">Air-Dominant:</em> Mostly open space, planes with this trait
      have just a few bits of floating stone or other elements. They usually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a
      plane may include clouds of acidic or toxic gas. Creatures of the earth subtype are uncomfortable on air-dominant
      planes because they have little or no natural earth to connect with. They take no actual damage, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="elemental-and-energy-traits--earth-dominant">Earth-Dominant:</em> Planes with this trait are mostly solid.
      Travelers who arrive run the risk of suffocation if they don’t reach a cavern or other pocket within the earth.
      Worse yet, individuals without the ability to burrow are entombed in the earth and must dig their way out (5 feet
      per turn). Creatures of the air subtype are uncomfortable on earth dominant planes because these planes are tight
      and claustrophobic to them. But they suffer no inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="elemental-and-energy-traits--fire-dominant">Fire-Dominant:</em> Planes with this trait are composed of
      flames that continually burn without consuming their fuel source. Fire-dominant planes are extremely hostile to
      Material Plane creatures, and those without resistance or immunity to fire are soon immolated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost immediately, and those wearing
      unprotected flammable clothing catch on fire. In addition, individuals take 3d10 points of fire damage every round
      they are on a fire-dominant plane. Creatures of the water subtype are extremely uncomfortable on fire-dominant
      planes. Those that are made of water take double damage each round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="elemental-and-energy-traits--water-dominant">Water-Dominant:</em> Planes with this trait are mostly
      liquid. Visitors who can’t breathe water or reach a pocket of air will likely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype
      are extremely uncomfortable on water-dominant planes. Those made of fire take 1d10 points of damage each round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="elemental-and-energy-traits--positive-dominant">Positive-Dominant:</em> An abundance of life characterizes
      planes with this trait. The two kinds of positive-dominant traits are minor positive-dominant and major
      positive-dominant. A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion of life in all its forms. Colors are
      brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations are more intense as a result of the positive energy
      swirling through the plane. All individuals in a positive-dominant plane gain fast healing 2 as an extraordinary
      ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major positive-dominant planes go even further. A creature on a major positive-dominant plane must make a DC 15
      Fortitude save to avoid being blinded for 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. Simply being on the
      plane grants fast healing 5 as an extraordinary ability. In addition, those at full hit points gain 5 additional
      temporary hit points per round. These temporary hit points fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the major
      positive- dominant plane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round that its temporary hit
      points exceed its normal hit point total. Failing the saving throw results in the creature exploding in a riot of
      energy, killing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="elemental-and-energy-traits--negative-dominant">Negative-Dominant:</em> Planes with this trait are vast,
      empty reaches that suck the life out of travelers who cross them. They tend to be lonely, haunted planes, drained
      of color and filled with winds bearing the soft moans of those who died within them. As with positive-dominant
      planes, negative-dominant planes can be either minor or major. On minor negative-dominant planes, living creatures
      take 1d6 points of damage per round. At 0 hit points or lower, they crumble into ash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major negative-dominant planes are even more severe. Each round, those within must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or
      gain a negative level. A creature whose negative levels equal its current levels or Hit Dice is slain, becoming a
      wraith. The <i>death ward</i> spell protects a traveler from the damage and energy drain of a negative-dominant
      plane.
    </p>
    <h2 id="alignment-traits">Alignment Traits</h2>
    <p>
      Some planes have a predisposition to a certain alignment. Most of the inhabitants of these planes also have the
      plane’s particular alignment, even powerful creatures such as deities. In addition, creatures of alignments
      contrary to the plane have a tougher time dealing with its natives and situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alignment trait of a plane affects social interactions there. Characters who follow other alignments than most
      of the inhabitants do may find life more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alignment traits have multiple components. First are the moral (good or evil) and ethical (lawful or chaotic)
      components; a plane can have either a moral component, an ethical component, or one of each. Second, the specific
      alignment trait indicates whether each moral or ethical component is mildly or strongly evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="alignment-traits--good-alignedevil-aligned">Good-Aligned/Evil-Aligned:</em> These planes have chosen a
      side in the battle of good versus evil. No plane can be both good-aligned and evil-aligned.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="alignment-traits--law-alignedchaos-aligned">Law-Aligned/Chaos-Aligned:</em> Law versus chaos is the key
      struggle for these planes and their residents. No plane can be both law-aligned and chaos-aligned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each part of the moral/ethical alignment trait has a descriptor, either “mildly” or “strongly,” to show how
      powerful the influence of alignment is on the plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="alignment-traits--mildly-aligned">Mildly Aligned:</em> Creatures who have an alignment opposite that of a
      mildly aligned plane take a –2 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="alignment-traits--strongly-aligned">Strongly Aligned:</em> On planes that are strongly aligned, a –2
      circumstance penalty applies on all Charisma-based checks made by all creatures not of the plane’s alignment. In
      addition, the –2 penalty affects all Intelligence-based and Wisdom-based checks, too.
    </p>
    <p>The penalties for the moral and ethical components of the alignment trait do stack.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="alignment-traits--neutral-aligned">Neutral-Aligned:</em> A mildly neutral-aligned plane does not apply a
      circumstance penalty to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Material Plane is considered mildly neutral-aligned, though it may contain high concentrations of evil or
      good, law or chaos in places.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strongly neutral-aligned plane would stand in opposition to all other moral and ethical principles: good, evil,
      law, and chaos. Such a plane may be more concerned with the balance of the alignments than with accommodating and
      accepting alternate points of view. In the same fashion as for other strongly aligned planes, strongly
      neutral-aligned planes apply a –2 circumstance penalty to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based checks by any
      creature that isn’t neutral. The penalty is applied twice (once for law/chaos, and once for good/evil), so neutral
      good, neutral evil, lawful neutral, and chaotic neutral creatures take a –2 penalty and lawful good, chaotic good,
      chaotic evil, and lawful evil creatures take a –4 penalty.
    </p>
    <h2 id="magic-traits">Magic Traits</h2>
    <p>
      A plane’s magic trait describes how magic works on the plane compared to how it works on the Material Plane.
      Particular locations on a plane (such as those under the direct control of deities) may be pockets where a
      different magic trait applies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="magic-traits--normal-magic">Normal Magic:</em> This magic trait means that all spells and supernatural
      abilities function as written. Unless otherwise noted in a description, every plane has the normal magic trait.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="magic-traits--wild-magic">Wild Magic:</em> On a plane with the wild magic trait spells and spell-like
      abilities function in radically different and sometimes dangerous ways. Any spell or spell-like ability used on a
      wild magic plane has a chance to go awry. The caster must make a level check (DC 15 + the level of the spell or
      effect) for the magic to function normally. For spell-like abilities, use the level or HD of the creature
      employing the ability for the caster level check and the level of the spell-like ability to set the DC for the
      caster level check. Failure on this check means that something strange happens; roll d% and consult the following
      table.

      <em id="magic-traits--impeded-magic">Impeded Magic:</em> Particular spells and spell-like abilities are more
      difficult to cast on planes with this trait, often because the nature of the plane interferes with the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cast an impeded spell, the caster must make a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + the level of the spell). If the check
      fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the
      spell functions normally.

      <em id="magic-traits--enhanced-magic">Enhanced Magic:</em> Particular spells and spell-like abilities are easier
      to use or more powerful in effect on planes with this trait than they are on the Material Plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natives of a plane with the enhanced magic trait are aware of which spells and spell-like abilities are enhanced,
      but planar travelers may have to discover this on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a spell is enhanced, certain metamagic feats can be applied to it without changing the spell slot required or
      the casting time. Spellcasters on the plane are considered to have that feat or feats for the purpose of applying
      them to that spell. Spellcasters native to the plane must gain the feat or feats normally if they want to use them
      on other planes as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="magic-traits--limited-magic">Limited Magic:</em> Planes with this trait permit only the use of spells and
      spell-like abilities that meet particular qualifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magic can be limited to effects from certain schools or subschools, to effects with certain descriptors, or to
      effects of a certain level (or any combination of these qualities). Spells and spell-like abilities that don’t
      meet the qualifications simply don’t work.

      <em id="magic-traits--dead-magic">Dead Magic:</em> These planes have no magic at all. A plane with the dead magic
      trait functions in all respects like an <i>antimagic field</i> spell. Divination spells cannot detect subjects
      within a dead magic plane, nor can a spellcaster use <i>teleport</i> or another spell to move in or out. The only
      exception to the “no magic” rule is permanent planar portals, which still function normally.

    <h2 id="how-planes-interact">How Planes Interact</h2>
    <p>
      <strong id="how-planes-interact--separate-planes">Separate Planes:</strong> Two planes that are separate do not
      overlap or directly connect to each other. They are like planets in different orbits. The only way to get from one
      separate plane to the other is to go through a third plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="how-planes-interact--coterminous-planes">Coterminous Planes:</strong> Planes that touch at specific
      points are coterminous. Where they touch, a connection exists, and travelers can leave one reality behind and
      enter the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="how-planes-interact--coexistent-planes">Coexistent Planes:</strong> If a link between two planes can
      be created at any point, the two planes are coexistent. These planes overlap each other completely. A coexistent
      plane can be reached from anywhere on the plane it overlaps. When moving on a coexistent plane, it is often
      possible to see into or interact with the plane it coexists with.
    </p>
    <h3 id="how-planes-interact--layered-planes">Layered Planes</h3>
    <p>
      Infinities may be broken into smaller infinities, and planes into smaller, related planes. These layers are
      effectively separate planes of existence, and each layer can have its own planar traits. Layers are connected to
      each other through a variety of planar gates, natural vortices, paths, and shifting borders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Access to a layered plane from elsewhere usually happens on a specific layer: the first layer of the plane, which
      can be either the top layer or the bottom layer, depending on the specific plane. Most fixed access points (such
      as portals and natural vortices) reach this layer, which makes it the gateway for other layers of the plane. The
      <i>plane shift</i> spell also deposits the spellcaster on the first layer of the plane.
    </p>
    <h2 id="plane-descriptions">Plane Descriptions</h2>
    <h3 id="plane-descriptions--the-material-plane">The Material Plane</h3>
    <p>The Material Plane is the center of most cosmologies and defines what is considered normal.</p>
    <p>The Material Plane has the following traits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Normal gravity.</li>
      <li>Normal Time</li>
      <li>Alterable morphic.</li>
      <li>No Elemental or Energy Traits (specific locations may have these traits, however)</li>
      <li>Mildly neutral-aligned.</li>
      <li>Normal magic.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="plane-descriptions--the-ethereal-plane">The Ethereal Plane</h3>
    <p>
      The Ethereal Plane is coexistent with the Material Plane and often other planes as well. The Material Plane itself
      is visible from the Ethereal Plane, but it appears muted and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and
      its edges turning fuzzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it is possible to see into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane, the Ethereal Plane is usually
      invisible to those on the Material Plane. Normally, creatures on the Ethereal Plane cannot attack creatures on the
      Material Plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible, incorporeal, and utterly silent to
      someone on the Material Plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ethereal Plane is mostly empty of structures and impediments. However, the plane has its own inhabitants. Some
      of these are other ethereal travelers, but the ghosts found here pose a particular peril to those who walk the
      fog.
    </p>
    <p>It has the following traits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No gravity.</li>
      <li>Alterable morphic. The plane contains little to alter, however.</li>
      <li>Mildly neutral-aligned.</li>
      <li>
        Normal magic. Spells function normally on the Ethereal Plane, though they do not cross into the Material Plane.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The only exceptions are spells and spell-like abilities that have the force descriptor and abjuration spells that
      affect ethereal beings. Spellcasters on the Material Plane must have some way to detect foes on the Ethereal Plane
      before targeting them with force-based spells, of course. While it’s possible to hit ethereal enemies with a force
      spell cast on the Material Plane, the reverse isn’t possible. No magical attacks cross from the Ethereal Plane to
      the Material Plane, including force attacks.
    </p>
    <h3 id="plane-descriptions--plane-of-shadow">Plane of Shadow</h3>
    <p>
      The Plane of Shadow is a dimly lit dimension that is both coterminous to and coexistent with the Material Plane.
      It overlaps the Material Plane much as the Ethereal Plane does, so a planar traveler can use the Plane of Shadow
      to cover great distances quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Plane of Shadow is also coterminous to other planes. With the right spell, a character can use the Plane of
      Shadow to visit other realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Plane of Shadow is a world of black and white; color itself has been bleached from the environment. It is
      otherwise appears similar to the Material Plane.
    </p>
    <p>Despite the lack of light sources, various plants, animals, and humanoids call the Plane of Shadow home.</p>
    <p>
      The Plane of Shadow is magically morphic, and parts continually flow onto other planes. As a result, creating a
      precise map of the plane is next to impossible, despite the presence of landmarks.
    </p>
    <p>The Plane of Shadow has the following traits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Magically morphic. Certain spells modify the base material of the Plane of Shadow. The utility and power of
        these spells within the Plane of Shadow make them particularly useful for explorers and natives alike.
      </li>
      <li>Mildly neutral-aligned.</li>
      <li>
        <div>
          Enhanced magic. Spells with the shadow descriptor are enhanced on the Plane of Shadow. Such spells are cast as
          though they were prepared with the Maximize Spell feat, though they don’t require the higher spell slots.
        </div>
        <div>
          Furthermore, specific spells become more powerful on the Plane of Shadow. <i>Shadow conjuration</i> and
          <i>shadow evocation</i> spells are 30% as powerful as the conjurations and evocations they mimic (as opposed
          to 20%). <i>Greater shadow conjuration</i> and <i>greater shadow evocation</i> are 70% as powerful (not 60%),
          and a <i>shades</i> spell conjures at 90% of the power of the original (not 80%).
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          Impeded magic. Spells that use or generate light or fire may fizzle when cast on the Plane of Shadow. A
          spellcaster attempting a spell with the light or fire descriptor must succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 20 +
          the level of the spell). Spells that produce light are less effective in general, because all light sources
          have their ranges halved on the Plane of Shadow.
        </div>
        <div>
          Despite the dark nature of the Plane of Shadow, spells that produce, use, or manipulate darkness are
          unaffected by the plane.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="plane-descriptions--the-astral-plane">The Astral Plane</h3>
    <p>
      The Astral Plane is the space between the planes. When a character moves through an interplanar portal or projects
      her spirit to a different plane of existence, she travels through the Astral Plane. Even spells that allow
      instantaneous movement across a planebriefly touch the Astral Plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Astral Plane is a great, endless sphere of clear silvery sky, both above and below. Occasional bits of solid
      matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.
    </p>
    <p>Both planar travelers and refugees from other planes call the Astral Plane home.</p>
    <p>The Astral Plane has the following traits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subjective directional gravity.</li>
      <li>
        Timeless. Age, hunger, thirst, poison, and natural healing don’t function in the Astral Plane, though they
        resume functioning when the traveler leaves the Astral Plane.
      </li>
      <li>Mildly neutral-aligned.</li>
      <li>
        Enhanced magic. All spells and spell-like abilities used within the Astral Plane may be employed as if they were
        improved by the Quicken Spell feat. Already quickened spells and spell-like abilities are unaffected, as are
        spells from magic items. Spells so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified level. As with the
        Quicken Spell feat, only one quickened spell can be cast per round.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="plane-descriptions--elemental-plane-of-air">Elemental Plane of Air</h3>
    <p>The Elemental Plane of Air is an empty plane, consisting of sky above and sky below.</p>
    <p>
      The Elemental Plane of Air is the most comfortable and survivable of the Inner Planes, and it is the home of all
      manner of airborne creatures. Indeed, flying creatures find themselves at a great advantage on this plane. While
      travelers without flight can survive easily here, they are at a disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>The Elemental Plane of Air has the following traits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Subjective directional gravity. Inhabitants of the plane determine their own “down” direction. Objects not under
        the motive force of others do not move.
      </li>
      <li>Air-dominant.</li>
      <li>
        Enhanced magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use, manipulate, or create air (including spells of the Air
        domain) are both empowered and enlarged (as if the Empower Spell and Enlarge Spell metamagic feats had been used
        on them, but the spells don’t require higher-level slots).
      </li>
      <li>
        Impeded magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use or create earth (including spells of the Earth domain
        and spells that summon earth elementals or outsiders with the earth subtype) are impeded.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="plane-descriptions--elemental-plane-of-earth">Elemental Plane of Earth</h3>
    <p>
      The Elemental Plane of Earth is a solid place made of rock, soil, and stone. An unwary and unprepared traveler may
      find himself entombed within this vast solidity of material and have his life crushed into nothingness, his
      powdered remains a warning to any foolish enough to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite its solid, unyielding nature, the Elemental Plane of Earth is varied in its consistency, ranging from
      relatively soft soil to veins of heavier and more valuable metal.
    </p>
    <p>The Elemental Plane of Earth has the following traits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Earth-dominant.</li>
      <li>
        Enhanced magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use, manipulate, or create earth or stone (including those
        of the Earth domain) are both empowered and extended (as if the Empower Spell and Extend Spell metamagic feats
        had been used on them, but the spells don’t require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that
        are already empowered or extended are unaffected by this benefit.

    </ul>
    <h3 id="plane-descriptions--elemental-plane-of-fire">Elemental Plane of Fire</h3>
    <p>
      Everything is alight on the Elemental Plane of Fire. The ground is nothing more than great, evershifting plates of
      compressed flame. The air ripples with the heat of continual firestorms, and the most common liquid is magma, not
      water. The oceans are made of liquid flame, and the mountains ooze with molten lava. Fire survives here without
      need for fuel or air, but flammables brought onto the plane are consumed readily.
    </p>
    <p>The Elemental Plane of Fire has the following traits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fire-dominant.</li>
      <li>
        Enhanced magic. Spells and spell-like abilities with the fire descriptor are both maximized and enlarged (as if
        the Maximize Spell and Enlarge Spell had been used on them, but the spells don’t require higher-level slots).
        Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized or enlarged are unaffected by this benefit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Impeded magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use or create water (including spells of the Water domain
        and spells that summon water elementals or outsiders with the water subtype) are impeded.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="plane-descriptions--elemental-plane-of-water">Elemental Plane of Water</h3>
    <p>
      The Elemental Plane of Water is a sea without a floor or a surface, an entirely fluid environment lit by a diffuse
      glow. It is one of the more hospitable of the Inner Planes once a traveler gets past the problem of breathing the
      local medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eternal oceans of this plane vary between ice cold and boiling hot, between saline and fresh. They are
      perpetually in motion, wracked by currents and tides. The plane’s permanent settlements form around bits of
      flotsam and jetsam suspended within this endless liquid. These settlements drift on the tides of the Elemental
      Plane of Water.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Elemental Plane of Water has the following traits.</li>
      <li>
        Subjective directional gravity. The gravity here works similar to that of the Elemental Plane of Air. But
        sinking or rising on the Elemental Plane of Water is slower (and less dangerous) than on the Elemental Plane of
        Air.
      </li>
      <li>Water-dominant.</li>
      <li>
        Enhanced magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use or create water are both extended and enlarged (as if

        this benefit.
      </li>
      <li>

    </ul>
    <h3 id="plane-descriptions--negative-energy-plane">Negative Energy Plane</h3>
    <p>
      To an observer, there’s little to see on the Negative Energy Plane. It is a dark, empty place, an eternal pit
      where a traveler can fall until the plane itself steals away all light and life. The Negative Energy Plane is the
      most hostile of the Inner Planes, and the most uncaring and intolerant of life. Only creatures immune to its
      life-draining energies can survive there.
    </p>
    <p>The Negative Energy Plane has the following traits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subjective directional gravity.</li>
      <li>
        Major negative-dominant. Some areas within the plane have only the minor negative-dominant trait, and these
        islands tend to be inhabited.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enhanced magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are maximized (as if the Maximize Spell
        metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don’t require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like
        abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. Class abilities that use negative energy,
        such as rebuking and controlling undead, gain a +10 bonus on the roll to determine Hit Dice affected.
      </li>
      <li>
        Impeded magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including <i>cure</i> spells, are
        impeded. Characters on this plane take a –10 penalty on Fortitude saving throws made to remove negative levels
        bestowed by an energy drain attack.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Random Encounters: Because the Negative Energy Plane is virtually devoid of creatures, random encounters on the
      plane are exceedingly rare.
    </p>
    <h3 id="plane-descriptions--positive-energy-plane">Positive Energy Plane</h3>
    <p>
      The Positive Energy Plane has no surface and is akin to the Elemental Plane of Air with its wide-open nature.
      However, every bit of this plane glows brightly with innate power. This power is dangerous to mortal forms, which
      are not made to handle it. Despite the beneficial effects of the plane, it is one of the most hostile of the Inner
      Planes. An unprotected character on this plane swells with power as positive energy is force-fed into her. Then,
      her mortal frame unable to contain that power, she immolates as if she were a small planet caught at the edge of a
      supernova. Visits to the Positive Energy Plane are brief, and even then travelers must be heavily protected.
    </p>
    <p>The Positive Energy Plane has the following traits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subjective directional gravity.</li>
      <li>
        Major positive-dominant. Some regions of the plane have the minor positive-dominant trait instead, and those
        islands tend to be inhabited.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enhanced magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including <i>cure</i> spells, are
        maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don’t require
        higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit.
        Class abilities that use positive energy, such as turning and destroying undead, gain a +10 bonus on the roll to
        determine Hit Dice affected. (Undead are almost impossible to find on this plane, however.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Impeded magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy (including <i>inflict</i> spells) are
        impeded.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Random Encounters: Because the Positive Energy Plane is virtually devoid of creatures, random encounters on the
      plane are exceedingly rare.
