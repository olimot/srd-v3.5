    <h1>FEATS</h1>

    <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
      Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated ability score, class feature, feat, skill,
      base attack bonus, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain a feat at
      the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.
    </p>
    <p>A character can’t use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.</p>
    <h2 id="types-of-feats">Types of Feats</h2>
    <p>
      Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are item creation feats,
      which allow spellcasters to create magic items of all sorts. A metamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare and cast
      a spell with greater effect, albeit as if the spell were a higher spell level than it actually is.
    </p>
    <h3 id="types-of-feats--fighter-bonus-feats">Fighter Bonus Feats</h3>
    <p>
      Any feat designated as a fighter feat can be selected as a fighter’s bonus feat. This designation does not
      restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming that they meet any prerequisites.
    </p>
    <h3 id="types-of-feats--item-creation-feats">Item Creation Feats</h3>
    <p>
      An item creation feat lets a spellcaster create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items
      they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="types-of-feats--item-creation-feats--xp-cost">XP Cost:</strong> Experience that the spellcaster would
      normally keep is expended when making a magic item. The XP cost equals 1/25 of the cost of the item in gold
      pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough
      XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to
      advance a level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="types-of-feats--item-creation-feats--raw-materials-cost">Raw Materials Cost:</strong> The cost of
      creating a magic item equals one-half the sale cost of the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A
      character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="types-of-feats--item-creation-feats--time">Time:</strong> The time to create a magic item depends on
      the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="types-of-feats--item-creation-feats--item-cost">Item Cost:</strong> Brew Potion, Craft Wand, and
      Scribe Scroll create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the power of these items depends on their
      caster level—that is, a spell from such an item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that
      level. The price of these items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the
      caster level. The caster level must be high enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at
      that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster level by the spell level, then multiply the
      result by a constant, as shown below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="types-of-feats--item-creation-feats--item-cost--scrolls">Scrolls:</em> Base price = spell level x caster
      level x 25 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="types-of-feats--item-creation-feats--item-cost--potions">Potions:</em> Base price = spell level x caster
      level x 50 gp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="types-of-feats--item-creation-feats--item-cost--wands">Wands:</em> Base price = spell level x caster level
      x 750 gp.
    </p>
    <p>A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the purpose of this calculation.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="types-of-feats--item-creation-feats--extra-costs">Extra Costs:</strong> Any potion, scroll, or wand
      that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. For potions
      and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component or pay the XP cost when creating the item.
    </p>
    <p>For a wand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.</p>
    <p>Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
    <h3 id="types-of-feats--metamagic-feats">Metamagic Feats</h3>
    <p>
      As a spellcaster’s knowledge of magic grows, she can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the ways
      in which the spells were originally designed or learned. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder
      than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, at least it is possible. Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a
      spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the DC for saving throws against it
      does not go up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="types-of-feats--metamagic-feats--wizards-and-divine-spellcasters"
        >Wizards and Divine Spellcasters:</strong
      >
      Wizards and divine spellcasters must prepare their spells in advance. During preparation, the character chooses
      which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and thus which ones take up higher-level spell slots than normal).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="types-of-feats--metamagic-feats--sorcerers-and-bards">Sorcerers and Bards:</strong> Sorcerers and
      bards choose spells as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether to apply their
      metamagic feats to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot.
      But because the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a metamagic form in advance, he must apply the
      metamagic feat on the spot. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one
      enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell’s normal casting time is 1
      action, casting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. (This isn’t the same as a
      1-round casting time.)
    </p>
    <p>For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="types-of-feats--metamagic-feats--spontaneous-casting-and-metamagic-feats"
        >Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats:</strong
      >
      A cleric spontaneously casting a <i>cure</i> or <i>inflict</i> spell can cast a metamagic version of it instead.
      Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a 1-action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action,
      and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="types-of-feats--metamagic-feats--effects-of-metamagic-feats-on-a-spell"
        >Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell:</strong
      >
      In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared and cast as a
      higher-level spell. Saving throw modifications are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description.
    </p>
    <p>
      The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can’t use
      a metamagic feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don’t eliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by casting
      a spell while threatened. However, casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific feat descriptions for the spells that a
      particular feat can’t modify.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="types-of-feats--metamagic-feats--multiple-metamagic-feats-on-a-spell"
        >Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell:</strong
      >
      A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level are cumulative. You can’t
      apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="types-of-feats--metamagic-feats--magic-items-and-metamagic-spells"
        >Magic Items and Metamagic Spells:</strong
      >
      With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand.
      Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell’s higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic
      feat). A character doesn’t need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="types-of-feats--metamagic-feats--counterspelling-metamagic-spells"
        >Counterspelling Metamagic Spells:</strong
      >
      Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling
      or its ability to counterspell another spell.

      When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no
      higher than your own level. The base price of a potion is its spell level x its caster level x 50 gp. To brew a

      When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks
      the potion is the target of the spell.

      Improved familiars otherwise use the rules for regular familiars, with two exceptions: If the creature’s type is
      something other than animal, its type does not change; and improved familiars do not gain the ability to speak
      with other creatures of their kind (although many of them already have the ability to communicate).
    </p>
    <p>
      The list in the table above presents only a few possible improved familiars. Almost any creature of the same
      general size and power as those on the list makes a suitable familiar. Nor is the master’s alignment the only
      possible categorization. For instance, improved familiars could be assigned by the master’s creature type or
      subtype, as shown below.

    <p>
      <em id="feat-descriptions--leadership-general--leadership-modifiers--leadership-score">Leadership Score:</em> A
      character’s base Leadership score equals his level plus any Charisma modifier. In order to take into account
      negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but the character must still be 6th
      level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect a character’s Leadership score,
      as detailed above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="feat-descriptions--leadership-general--leadership-modifiers--cohort-level">Cohort Level:</em> The
      character can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of a character’s Leadership score, he can only
      recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than himself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate
      for its level. A character can try to attract a cohort of a particular race, class, and alignment. The cohort’s
      alignment may not be opposed to the leader’s alignment on either the law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis, and the
      leader takes a Leadership penalty if he recruits a cohort of an alignment different from his own.
    </p>
    <p>Cohorts earn XP as follows:</p>
    <p>The cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party’s XP.</p>
    <p>
      Divide the cohort’s level by the level of the PC with whom he or she is associated (the character with the
      Leadership feat who attracted the cohort).
    </p>
    <p>
      Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and add that number of experience points to the cohort’s
      total.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than the associated PC’s character level, the cohort
      does not gain the new level—its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed attain the next level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="feat-descriptions--leadership-general--leadership-modifiers--number-of-followers-by-level"
        >Number of Followers by Level:</em
      >
      The character can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts,
      except they’re generally low-level NPCs. Because they’re generally five or more levels behind the character they
      follow, they’re rarely effective in combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followers don’t earn experience and thus don’t gain levels. However, when a character with Leadership attains a
      new level, the player consults the table above to determine if she has acquired more followers, some of which may
      be higher level than the existing followers. (You don’t consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels,
      however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.)

    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--manyshot-general--benefit">Benefit:</strong> As a standard action, you may fire two
      arrows at a single opponent within 30 feet. Both arrows use the same attack roll (with a –4 penalty) to determine
      success and deal damage normally (but see Special).
    </p>
    <p>
      For every five points of base attack bonus you have above +6, you may add one additional arrow to this attack, to
      a maximum of four arrows at a base attack bonus of +16. However, each arrow after the second adds a cumulative –2
      penalty on the attack roll (for a total penalty of –6 for three arrows and –8 for four).
    </p>
    <p>Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="feat-descriptions--manyshot-general--special">Special:</strong> Regardless of the number of arrows you
      fire, you apply precision-based damage only once. If you score a critical hit, only the first arrow fired deals
      critical damage; all others deal regular damage.
    </p>
    <p>A fighter may select Manyshot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
    <p>

      the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.

      You can gain Martial Weapon Proficiency multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of

      A cleric who chooses the War domain automatically gains the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat related to his deity’s
