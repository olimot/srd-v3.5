    </table>
    <p>
      <em>First Aid:</em> You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit points
      and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable. A
      stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Long-Term Care:</em> Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal
      check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to ability damage) at twice the
      normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full
      day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for
      each full day of complete rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on)
      that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You
      cannot give long-term care to yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Treat Wound from Caltrop, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones:</em> A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop
      moves at one-half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature wounded by a <i>spike growth</i> or <i>spike stones</i> spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take
      injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to
      dress the victim’s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell’s save DC.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Treat Poison:</em> To treat poison means to tend a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to
      take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving
      throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her
      saving throw, whichever is higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Treat Disease:</em> To treat a disease means to tend a single diseased character. Every time he or she makes a
      saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check result or his
      or her saving throw, whichever is higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating
      a disease or tending a creature wounded by a <i>spike growth</i> or <i>spike stones</i> spell takes 10 minutes of
      work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. Generally speaking, you can’t try a Heal check again without proof of the
      original check’s failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous
      attempt is still alive.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Special:</strong> A character with the Self-Sufficient feat gets a +2 bonus on Heal checks.</p>
    <p>A healer’s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.</p>
    <h2 id="hide">Hide <small>(Dex; Armor Check Penalty)</small></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Check:</strong> Your Hide check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone who might see you. You can move up
      to one-half your normal speed and hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than
      your normal speed, you take a –5 penalty. It’s practically impossible (–20 penalty) to hide while attacking,
      running or charging.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Hide checks depending on its size
      category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large –4, Huge –8, Gargantuan –12, Colossal –16.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need cover or concealment in order to attempt a Hide check. Total cover or total concealment usually (but not
      always; see Special, below) obviates the need for a Hide check, since nothing can see you anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      If people are observing you, even casually, you can’t hide. You can run around a corner or behind cover so that
      you’re out of sight and then hide, but the others then know at least where you went.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check; see below), though, you can attempt to
      hide. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get to a hiding
      place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot per rank you have in Hide.)
      This check, however, is made at a –10 penalty because you have to move fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Sniping:</em> If you’ve already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged
      attack, then immediately hide again. You take a –20 penalty on your Hide check to conceal yourself after the shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Creating a Diversion to Hide:</em> You can use Bluff to help you hide. A successful Bluff check can give you
      the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check as part of movement, so it doesn’t take a
      separate action. However, hiding immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on Hide checks if you are immobile, or a +20
      bonus on Hide checks if you’re moving.
    </p>
    <p>If you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on Hide checks.</p>
    <p>
      A 13th-level ranger can attempt a Hide check in any sort of natural terrain, even if it doesn’t grant cover or
      concealment. A 17thlevel ranger can do this even while being observed.
    </p>
    <h2 id="intimidate">Intimidate <small>(Cha)</small></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Check:</strong> You can change another’s behavior with a successful check. Your Intimidate check is
      opposed by the target’s modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target’s Wisdom bonus [if any]
      + target’s modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target’s check result, you may treat the target as
      friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its
      normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the
      Diplomacy skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence,
      and for 1d6×10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target’s default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly
      (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or useless information, or otherwise
      frustrates your efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Demoralize Opponent:</em> You can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent’s resolve in combat. To do so,
      make an Intimidate check opposed by the target’s modified level check (see above). If you win, the target becomes
      shaken for 1 round. A shaken character takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. You
      can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in melee combat and that can see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Changing another’s behavior requires 1 minute of interaction. Intimidating an
      opponent in combat is a standard action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try Again:</strong> Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial
      check succeeds, the other character can be intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn’t help. If the initial check
      fails, the other character has probably become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is
      futile.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are larger
      than your target. Conversely, you take a –4 penalty on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are
      smaller than your target.
    </p>
    <p>A character immune to fear can’t be intimidated, nor can nonintelligent creatures.</p>
    <p>If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>
    <p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>
    <h2 id="jump">Jump <small>(Str; Armor Check Penalty)</small></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Check:</strong> The DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the type of jump you are
      attempting (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet then no modifier based on speed applies to the
      check. If your speed is less than 30 feet, you take a –6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If
      your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a
      straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled.
    </p>
    <p>Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round.</p>
    <p>
      If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you
      attempt a Jump check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Long Jump:</em> A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of
      the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is
      equal to the distance jumped (in feet).
    </p>
    <p>
      If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don’t
      clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your movement
      grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC
      15 Climb check.
    </p>

      <em>High Jump:</em> A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach a ledge high above or to grasp something
      overhead. The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached the desired height. If you wish
      to pull yourself up, you can do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check. If you fail the Jump check, you do
      not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the same spot from which you jumped. As with a long jump, the
      DC is doubled if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet.

      Obviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to the size of the character or creature.
      The maximum vertical reach (height the creature can reach without jumping) for an average creature of a given size
      is shown on the table below. (As a Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Quadrupedal creatures don’t have the same vertical reach as a bipedal creature; treat them as being one size
      category smaller.

      <em>Hop Up:</em> You can jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table or small boulder, with a DC
      10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then
      hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not
      get a running start.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Jumping Down:</em> If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you just
      fell. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so the DC is
      not doubled if you do not get a running start.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> None. A Jump check is included in your movement, so it is part of a move action. If you
      run out of movement mid-jump, your next action (either on this turn or, if necessary, on your next turn) must be a
      move action to complete the jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> Effects that increase your movement also increase your jumping distance, since your
      check is modified by your speed.
    </p>
    <p>If you have the Run feat, you get a +4 bonus on Jump checks for any jumps made after a running start.</p>
    <p>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Jump checks because halflings are agile and athletic.</p>
    <p>If you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.</p>
    <p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks.</p>
    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Jump, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks.</p>

      Like the Craft and Profession skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of unrelated skills. Knowledge
      represents a study of some body of lore, possibly an academic or even scientific discipline.

    </p>
    <p>
      In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In
      general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster’s HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of
      useful information about that monster.
    </p>
    <p>For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge check doesn’t take an action—you simply
      know the answer or you don’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try Again:</strong> No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time
      doesn’t let you know something that you never learned in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana), you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft
      checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering), you get a +2 bonus on Search checks made
      to find secret doors or hidden compartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made to keep from
      getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.
    </p>
    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), you get a +2 bonus on bardic knowledge checks.</p>
    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (local), you get a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks.</p>
    <p>
      If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made in aboveground
      natural environments (aquatic, desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, or plains).
    </p>
    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nobility and royalty), you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>
    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion), you get a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.</p>
    <p>
      If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while on other
      planes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while
      underground.
    </p>
    <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Untrained:</strong> An untrained Knowledge check is simply an Intelligence check. Without actual training,
      you know only common knowledge (DC 10 or lower).
    </p>
    <h2 id="listen">Listen <small>(Wis)</small></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Check:</strong> Your Listen check is either made against a DC that reflects how quiet the noise is that
      you might hear, or it is opposed by your target’s Move Silently check.

      In the case of people trying to be quiet, the DCs given on the table could be replaced by Move Silently checks, in
      which case the indicated DC would be their average check result.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Every time you have a chance to hear something in a reactive manner (such as when
      someone makes a noise or you move into a new area), you can make a Listen check without using an action. Trying to
      hear something you failed to hear previously is a move action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes. You can try to hear something that you failed to hear previously with no penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> When several characters are listening to the same thing, a single 1d20 roll can be used
      for all the individuals’ Listen checks.
    </p>
    <p>A fascinated creature takes a –4 penalty on Listen checks made as reactions.</p>

    <h2 id="move-silently">Move Silently <small>(Dex; Armor Check Penalty)</small></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Check:</strong> Your Move Silently check is opposed by the Listen check of anyone who might hear you. You
      can move up to one-half your normal speed at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less
      than your full speed, you take a –5 penalty. It’s practically impossible (–20 penalty) to move silently while
      running or charging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noisy surfaces, such as bogs or undergrowth, are tough to move silently across. When you try to sneak across such
      a surface, you take a penalty on your Move Silently check as indicated below.

    <p>A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks that involve its use.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening’s
      work to a full day’s performance. The bard’s special Perform-based abilities are described in that class’s
      description.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don’t negate previous failures, and an audience
      that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by
      2 for each previous failure.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> A bard must have at least 3 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire courage in his allies,
      or to use his countersong or his <i>fascinate</i> ability. A bard needs 6 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire
      competence, 9 ranks to use his <i>suggestion</i> ability, 12 ranks to inspire greatness, 15 ranks to use his
      <i>song of freedom</i> ability, 18 ranks to inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to use his
      <i>mass suggestion</i> ability. See Bardic Music in the bard class description.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to using the Perform skill, you can entertain people with sleight of hand, tumbling, tightrope
      walking, and spells (especially illusions).
    </p>
    <h2 id="profession">Profession <small>(Wis; Trained Only)</small></h2>
    <p>
      Like Craft, Knowledge, and Perform, Profession is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several
      Profession skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill. While a Craft skill represents
      ability in creating or making an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader
      range of less specific knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Check:</strong> You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your Profession
      check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to
      perform the profession’s daily tasks, how to supervise helpers, and how to handle common problems.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Action:</strong> Not applicable. A single check generally represents a week of work.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill to earn an income cannot be retried. You
      are stuck with whatever weekly wage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a week to
      determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt to accomplish some specific task can usually be
      retried.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Untrained:</strong> Untrained laborers and assistants (that is, characters without any ranks in
      Profession) earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.
    </p>
    <h2 id="ride">Ride <small>(Dex)</small></h2>
    <p>If you attempt to ride a creature that is ill suited as a mount, you take a –5 penalty on your Ride checks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Check:</strong> Typical riding actions don’t require checks. You can saddle, mount, ride, and dismount
      from a mount without a problem.
    </p>
    <p>The following tasks do require checks.</p>

    <p>
      <em>Guide with Knees:</em> You can react instantly to guide your mount with your knees so that you can use both
      hands in combat. Make your Ride check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand this round
      because you need to use the other to control your mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Stay in Saddle:</em> You can react instantly to try to avoid falling when your mount rears or bolts
      unexpectedly or when you take damage. This usage does not take an action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Fight with Warhorse:</em> If you direct your war-trained mount to attack in battle, you can still make your
      own attack or attacks normally. This usage is a free action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Cover:</em> You can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside your mount, using it as cover. You can’t
      attack or cast spells while using your mount as cover. If you fail your Ride check, you don’t get the cover
      benefit. This usage does not take an action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Soft Fall:</em> You can react instantly to try to take no damage when you fall off a mount—when it is killed
      or when it falls, for example. If you fail your Ride check, you take 1d6 points of falling damage. This usage does
      not take an action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Leap:</em> You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part of its movement. Use your Ride modifier or the
      mount’s Jump modifier, whichever is lower, to see how far the creature can jump. If you fail your Ride check, you
      fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate falling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does
      not take an action, but is part of the mount’s movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Spur Mount:</em> You can spur your mount to greater speed with a move action. A successful Ride check
      increases the mount’s speed by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage to the creature. You can use this
      ability every round, but each consecutive round of additional speed deals twice as much damage to the mount as the
      previous round (2 points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Control Mount in Battle:</em> As a move action, you can attempt to control a light horse, pony, heavy horse,
      or other mount not trained for combat riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check, you can do nothing else
      in that round. You do not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Fast Mount or Dismount:</em> You can attempt to mount or dismount from a mount of up to one size category
      larger than yourself as a free action, provided that you still have a move action available that round. If you
      fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting is a move action. You can’t use fast mount or dismount on a mount
      more than one size category larger than yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Mounting or dismounting normally is a move action. Other checks are a move
      action, a free action, or no action at all, as noted above.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you are riding bareback, you take a –5 penalty on Ride checks.</p>
    <p>
      If your mount has a military saddle you get a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the
      saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ride skill is a prerequisite for the feats Mounted Archery, Mounted Combat, Ride-By Attack, Spirited Charge,
    </p>
    <p>Trample.</p>
    <p>If you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> It takes a full-round action to search a 5-foot-by-5-foot area or a volume of goods 5
      feet on a side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Search checks, and a half-elf has a +1 racial bonus. An
      elf (but not a half-elf) who simply passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door can make a Search check to
      find that door.
    </p>
    <p>If you have the Investigator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Search checks.</p>
    <p>
      The spells
      <i>explosive runes, fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol,</i> and <i>teleportation circle</i> create magic traps
      that a rogue can find by making a successful Search check and then can attempt to disarm by using Disable Device.
      Identifying the location of a <i>snare</i> spell has a DC of 23. <i>Spike growth</i> and
      <i>spike stones</i> create magic traps that can be found using Search, but against which Disable Device checks do
      not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Active abjuration spells within 10 feet of each other for 24 hours or more create barely visible energy
      fluctuations. These fluctuations give you a +4 bonus on Search checks to locate such abjuration spells.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks to find or
      follow tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering), you get a +2 bonus on Search checks to
      find secret doors or hidden compartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Restriction:</strong> While anyone can use Search to find a trap whose DC is 20 or lower, only a rogue can
      use Search to locate traps with higher DCs. (<i>Exception:</i> The spell <i>find traps</i> temporarily enables a
      cleric to use the Search skill as if he were a rogue.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A dwarf, even one who is not a rogue, can use the Search skill to find a difficult trap (one with a DC higher than
      20) if the trap is built into or out of stone. He gains a +2 racial bonus on the Search check from his
      stonecunning ability.

    <h2 id="sense-motive">Sense Motive <small>(Wis)</small></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Check:</strong> A successful check lets you avoid being bluffed (see the Bluff skill). You can also use
      this skill to determine when “something is up” (that is, something odd is going on) or to assess someone’s
      trustworthiness.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Hunch:</em> This use of the skill involves making a gut assessment of the social situation. You can get the
      feeling from another’s behavior that something is wrong, such as when you’re talking to an impostor.
      Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Sense Enchantment:</em> You can tell that someone’s behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (by
      definition, a mind-affecting effect),even if that person isn’t aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if the target
      is dominated (see <i>dominate person</i>), the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target’s
      activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Discern Secret Message:</em> You may use Sense Motive to detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via
      the Bluff skill. In this case, your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff check of the character transmitting
      the message. For each piece of information relating to the message that you are missing, you take a –2 penalty on
      your Sense Motive check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that something hidden is being communicated, but
      you can’t learn anything specific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you intercept and understand
      the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you don’t detect any hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more, you
      infer some false information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> Trying to gain information with Sense Motive generally takes at least 1 minute, and you
      could spend a whole evening trying to get a sense of the people around you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try Again:</strong> No, though you may make a Sense Motive check for each Bluff check made against you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> A ranger gains a bonus on Sense Motive checks when using this skill against a favored
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>If you have the Negotiator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Sense Motive checks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.
    </p>
    <h2 id="sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand <small>(Dex; Trained Only; Armor Check Penalty)</small></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Check:</strong> A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a
      minor feat of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an observer is determined
      to note where the item went.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer’s Spot check. The
      observer’s success doesn’t prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling,
      or hand crossbow) on your body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone observing you or
      the Search check of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus on the Search check,
      since it’s generally easier to find such an object than to hide it. A dagger is easier to hide than most light
      weapons, and grants you a +2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it. An extraordinarily small object,
      such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it, and heavy or
      baggy clothing (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check.
    </p>
    <p>Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
    <p>
      If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to obtain it. The
      opponent makes a Spot check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand check result you achieved
      when you tried to grab the item. An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether
      you got the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience as though you were using the Perform skill. In such a
      case, your “act” encompasses elements of legerdemain, juggling, and the like.

    <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> Any Sleight of Hand check normally is a standard action. However, you may perform a
      Sleight of Hand check as a free action by taking a –20 penalty on the check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, but after an initial failure, a second Sleight of Hand attempt against the same
      target (or while you are being watched by the same observer who noticed your previous attempt) increases the DC
      for the task by 10.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.</p>
    <p><strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Untrained:</strong> An untrained Sleight of Hand check is simply a Dexterity check. Without actual
      training, you can’t succeed on any Sleight of Hand check with a DC higher than 10, except for hiding an object on
      your body.

    <h2 id="spot">Spot <small>(Wis)</small></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Check:</strong> The Spot skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding.
      Typically, your Spot check is opposed by the Hide check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a
      creature isn’t intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is necessary to
      notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Spot check result higher than 20 generally lets you become aware of an invisible creature near you, though you
      can’t actually see it.

      Spot is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the Disguise skill), and to read lips when you can’t hear or
      understand what someone is saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spot checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an encounter begins. A penalty applies on such
      checks, depending on the distance between the two individuals or groups, and an additional penalty may apply if
      the character making the Spot check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).

      language-dependent.) The base DC is 15, but it increases for complex speech or an inarticulate speaker. You must
      maintain a line of sight to the lips being read.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your Spot check succeeds, you can understand the general content of a minute’s worth of speaking, but you
      usually still miss certain details. If the check fails by 4 or less, you can’t read the speaker’s lips. If the
      check fails by 5 or more, you draw some incorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is rolled secretly in
      this case, so that you don’t know whether you succeeded or missed by 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Every time you have a chance to spot something in a reactive manner you can make
      a Spot check without using an action. Trying to spot something you failed to see previously is a move action. To
      read lips, you must concentrate for a full minute before making a Spot check, and you can’t perform any other
      action (other than moving at up to half speed) during this minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes. You can try to spot something that you failed to see previously at no penalty.
      You can attempt to read lips once per minute.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Special:</strong> A fascinated creature takes a –4 penalty on Spot checks made as reactions.</p>
    <p>If you have the Alertness feat, you get a +2 bonus on Spot checks.</p>
    <p>A ranger gains a bonus on Spot checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.</p>
    <p>An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>
    <p>A half-elf has a +1 racial bonus on Spot checks.</p>
    <p>The master of a hawk familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in daylight or other lighted areas.</p>

      <strong>Action:</strong> Varies. A single Survival check may represent activity over the course of hours or a full
      day. A Survival check made to find tracks is at least a full-round action, and it may take even longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try Again:</strong> Varies. For getting along in the wild or for gaining the Fortitude save bonus noted in
      the table above, you make a Survival check once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies until the next
      check is made. To avoid getting lost or avoid natural hazards, you make a Survival check whenever the situation
      calls for one. Retries to avoid getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid a specific natural hazard are not
      allowed. For finding tracks, you can retry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes(indoors) of
      searching.

      Survival to follow tracks when the task has a higher DC.

    <h2 id="swim">Swim <small>(Str; Armor Check Penalty)</small></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Check:</strong> Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at
      up to one-half your speed (as a full-round action) or at one-quarter your speed (as a move action). If you fail by
      4 or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater
      intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to your
      Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a
      standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can
      hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only half
      as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to continue
      holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution check, you
      begin to drown.

      <strong>Check:</strong> You can use this skill to read a spell or to activate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets
      you use a magic item as if you had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if you were a
      different race, or as if you were of a different alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a wand. If you are using the check to

      <em>Activate Blindly:</em> Some magic items are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate
      such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you’re not and even if you
      don’t know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must
      speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus on your Use
      Magic Device check if you’ve activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you
      can’t activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets
      released but it doesn’t do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong
      target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in
      addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally run when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not
      otherwise cast yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Decipher a Written Spell:</em> This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft
      skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Emulate an Ability Score:</em> To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability
      (Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer or bard spells). Your
      effective ability score (appropriate to the class you’re emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll)
      is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate
      ability, you don’t need to make this check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Emulate an Alignment:</em> Some magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user’s alignment.
      Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one
      alignment at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Emulate a Class Feature:</em> Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this
      case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20. This skill
      does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had
      that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it,
      either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Emulate a Race:</em> Some magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members of
      those races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Use a Scroll:</em> If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to decipher it first. Normally, to cast
      a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll’s spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to
      use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level
      of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum
      score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don’t have a sufficient score in that ability, you
      must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).
    </p>
    <p>This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Use a Wand:</em> Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand’s spell on your class spell list. This use of
      the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. This use of the
      skill also applies to other spell trigger magic items, such as staffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Action:</strong> None. The Use Magic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to
      activate the magic item.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you
      fail, then you can’t try to activate that item again for 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Special:</strong> You cannot take 10 with this skill.</p>
    <p>You can’t aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only the user of the item may attempt such a check.</p>
    <p>If you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks
      related to scrolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have 5 or more ranks in Decipher Script, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.

      <em>Secure a Grappling Hook:</em> Securing a grappling hook requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet
      of distance the grappling hook is thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by 4 or less indicates that
      the hook fails to catch and falls, allowing you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling
      hook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting weight. This check is made secretly, so that
      you don’t know whether the rope will hold your weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Bind a Character:</em> When you bind another character with a rope, any Escape Artist check that the bound
      character makes is opposed by your Use Rope check.
    </p>
    <p>
      You get a +10 bonus on this check because it is easier to bind someone than to escape from bonds. You don’t even
      make your Use Rope check until someone tries to escape.
    </p>

      <strong>Action:</strong> Varies. Throwing a grappling hook is a standard action that provokes an attack of
      opportunity. Tying a knot, tying a special knot, or tying a rope around yourself one-handed is a full-round action
      that provokes an attack of opportunity. Splicing two ropes together takes 5 minutes. Binding a character takes 1
      minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special:</strong> A silk rope gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Rope checks. If you cast an
      <i>animate rope</i> spell on a rope, you get a +2 circumstance bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using
      that rope.
    </p>
    <p>These bonuses stack.</p>
    <p>If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to
      climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks when escaping from rope bonds.
