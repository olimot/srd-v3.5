    <h1>SPECIAL ABILITIES &amp; CONDITIONS</h1>

    <h2 id="special-abilities">Special Abilities</h2>
    <p>A special ability is either extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural in nature.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--extraordinary-abilities-ex">Extraordinary Abilities (Ex):</strong> Extraordinary
      abilities are nonmagical. They are, however, not something that just anyone can do or even learn to do without
      extensive training. Effects or areas that negate or disrupt magic have no effect on extraordinary abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--spell-like-abilities-sp">Spell-Like Abilities (Sp):</strong> Spell-like abilities,
      as the name implies, are spells and magical abilities that are very much like spells. Spell-like abilities are
      subject to spell resistance and <i>dispel magic</i>. They do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or
      negated (such as an <i>antimagic field</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--supernatural-abilities-su">Supernatural Abilities (Su):</strong> Supernatural
      abilities are magical but not spell-like. Supernatural abilities are not subject to spell resistance and do not
      function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an <i>antimagic field</i>). A supernatural
      ability’s effect cannot be dispelled and is not subject to counterspells. See the table below for a summary of the
      types of special abilities.

    <h3 id="special-abilities--ability-score-loss">Ability Score Loss</h3>
    <p>
      Various attacks cause ability score loss, either ability damage or ability drain. Points lost to ability damage
      return at the rate of 1 point per day (or double that if the character gets complete bed rest) to each damaged
      ability, and the spells <i>lesser restoration</i> and <i>restoration</i> offset ability damage as well. Ability
      drain, however, is permanent, though <i>restoration</i> can restore even those lost ability score points.
    </p>
    <p>While any loss is debilitating, losing all points in an ability score can be devastating.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strength 0 means that the character cannot move at all. He lies helpless on the ground.</li>
      <li>Dexterity 0 means that the character cannot move at all. He stands motionless, rigid, and helpless.</li>
      <li>Constitution 0 means that the character is dead.</li>
      <li>Intelligence 0 means that the character cannot think and is unconscious in a coma-like stupor, helpless.</li>
      <li>Wisdom 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a deep sleep filled with nightmares, helpless.</li>
      <li>Charisma 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a catatonic, coma-like stupor, helpless.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Keeping track of negative ability score points is never necessary. A character’s ability score can’t drop below 0.
    </p>
    <p>Having a score of 0 in an ability is different from having no ability score whatsoever.</p>
    <p>
      Some spells or abilities impose an effective ability score reduction, which is different from ability score loss.
      Any such reduction disappears at the end of the spell’s or ability’s duration, and the ability score immediately
      returns to its former value.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character’s Constitution score drops, then he loses 1 hit point per Hit Die for every point by which his
      Constitution modifier drops. A hit point score can’t be reduced by Constitution damage or drain to less than 1 hit
      point per Hit Die.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ability that some creatures have to drain ability scores is a supernatural one, requiring some sort of attack.
      Such creatures do not drain abilities from enemies when the enemies strike them, even with unarmed attacks or
      natural weapons.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--antimagic">Antimagic</h3>
    <p>
      An <i>antimagic field</i> spell or effect cancels magic altogether. An antimagic effect has the following powers
      and characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No supernatural ability, spell-like ability, or spell works in an area of antimagic (but extraordinary abilities
        still work).
      </li>
      <li>
        Antimagic does not dispel magic; it suppresses it. Once a magical effect is no longer affected by the antimagic
        (the antimagic fades, the center of the effect moves away, and so on), the magic returns. Spells that still have
        part of their duration left begin functioning again, magic items are once again useful, and so forth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spell areas that include both an antimagic area and a normal area, but are not centered in the antimagic area,
        still function in the normal area. If the spell’s center is in the antimagic area, then the spell is suppressed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Golems and other constructs, elementals, outsiders, and corporeal undead, still function in an antimagic area
        (though the antimagic area suppresses their spellcasting and their supernatural and spell-like abilities
        normally). If such creatures are summoned or conjured, however, see below.
      </li>
      <li>
        Summoned or conjured creatures of any type, as well as incorporeal undead, wink out if they enter the area of an
        antimagic effect. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away.
      </li>
      <li>
        Magic items with continuous effectsdo not function in the area of an antimagic effect, but their effects are not
        canceled (so the contents of a <i>bag of holding</i> are unavailable, but neither spill out nor disappear
        forever).
      </li>
      <li>Two antimagic areas in the same place do not cancel each other out, nor do they stack.</li>
      <li>
        <i>Wall of force, prismatic wall,</i> and <i>prismatic sphere</i> are not affected by antimagic.
        <i>Break enchantment, dispel magic,</i> and <i>greater dispel magic</i> spells do not dispel antimagic.
        <i>Mage’s disjunction</i> has a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an <i>antimagic field.</i> If the
        <i>antimagic field</i> survives the <i>disjunction,</i> no items within it are disjoined.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--blindsight-and-blindsense">Blindsight and Blindsense</h3>
    <p>
      Some creatures have blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a nonvisual sense (or a combination of such
      senses) to operate effectively without vision. Such sense may include sensitivity to vibrations, acute scent, keen
      hearing, or echolocation. This ability makes invisibility and concealment (even magical darkness) irrelevant to
      the creature (though it still can’t see ethereal creatures). This ability operates out to a range specified in the
      creature description.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A creature cannot read with
        blindsight.
      </li>
      <li>Blindsight does not subject a creature to gaze attacks (even though darkvision does).</li>
      <li>Blinding attacks do not penalize creatures using blindsight.</li>
      <li>Deafening attacks thwart blindsight if it relies on hearing.</li>
      <li>Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.</li>
      <li>Blindsight negates displacement and blur effects.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--blindsight-and-blindsense--blindsense">Blindsense:</strong> Other creatures have
      blindsense, a lesser ability that lets the creature notice things it cannot see, but without the precision of
      blindsight. The creature with blindsense usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice and locate
      creatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any
      opponent the creature cannot see has total concealment (50% miss chance) against the creature with blindsense, and
      the blindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility
      still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity
      bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--breath-weapon">Breath Weapon</h3>
    <p>
      A creature attacking with a breath weapon is actually expelling something from its mouth (rather than conjuring it
      by means of a spell or some other magical effect). Most creatures with breath weapons are limited to a number of
      uses per day or by a minimum length of time that must pass between uses. Such creatures are usually smart enough
      to save their breath weapon until they really need it.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a breath weapon is typically a standard action.</li>
      <li>No attack roll is necessary. The breath simply fills its stated area.</li>
      <li>
        Any character caught in the area must make the appropriate saving throw or suffer the breath weapon’s full
        effect. In many cases, a character who succeeds on his saving throw still takes half damage or some other
        reduced effect.
      </li>
      <li>Breath weapons are supernatural abilities except where noted.</li>
      <li>Creatures are immune to their own breath weapons.</li>
      <li>Creatures unable to breathe can still use breath weapons. (The term is something of a misnomer.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--charm-and-compulsion">Charm and Compulsion</h3>
    <p>
      Many abilities and spells can cloud the minds of characters and monsters, leaving them unable to tell friend from
      foe—or worse yet, deceiving them into thinking that their former friends are now their worst enemies. Two general
      types of enchantments affect characters and creatures: charms and compulsions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charming another creature gives the charming character the ability to befriend and suggest courses of actions to
      his minion, but the servitude is not absolute or mindless. Charms of this type include the various
      <i>charm</i> spells. Essentially, a <i>charmed</i> character retains free will but makes choices according to a
      skewed view of the world.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <i>charmed</i> creature doesn’t gain any magical ability to understand his new friend’s language.</li>
      <li>
        A <i>charmed</i> character retains his original alignment and allegiances, generally with the exception that he
        now regards the <i>charming</i> creature as a dear friend and will give great weight to his suggestions and
        directions.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <i>charmed</i> character fights his former allies only if they threaten his new friend, and even then he uses
        the least lethal means at his disposal as long as these tactics show any possibility of success (just as he
        would in a fight between two actual friends).
      </li>
      <li>
        A <i>charmed</i> character is entitled to an opposed Charisma check against his master in order to resist
        instructions or commands that would make him do something he wouldn’t normally do even for a close friend. If he
        succeeds, he decides not to go along with that order but remains <i>charmed.</i>
      </li>
      <li>A <i>charmed</i> character never obeys a command that is obviously suicidal or grievously harmful to her.</li>
      <li>
        If the charming creature commands his minion to do something that the influenced character would be violently
        opposed to, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to break free of the influence altogether.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <i>charmed</i> character who is openly attacked by the creature who <i>charmed</i> him or by that creature’s
        apparent allies is automatically freed of the spell or effect.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Compulsion is a different matter altogether. A compulsion overrides the subject’s free will in some way or simply
      changes the way the subject’s mind works. A charm makes the subject a friend of the caster; a compulsion makes the
      subject obey the caster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of whether a character is charmed or compelled, he won’t volunteer information or tactics that his
      master doesn’t ask for.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--cold-immunity">Cold Immunity</h3>
    <p>
      A creature with cold immunity never takes cold damage. It has vulnerability to fire, which means it takes half
      again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save
      is a success or failure.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--damage-reduction">Damage Reduction</h3>
    <p>
      Some magic creatures have the supernatural ability to instantly heal damage from weapons or to ignore blows
      altogether as though they were invulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The numerical part of a creature’s damage reduction is the amount of hit points the creature ignores from normal
      attacks. Usually, a certain type of weapon can overcome this reduction. This information is separated from the
      damage reduction number by a slash. Damage reduction may be overcome by special materials, by magic weapons (any
      weapon with a +1 or higher enhancement bonus, not counting the enhancement from masterwork quality), certain types
      of weapons (such as slashing or bludgeoning), and weapons imbued with an alignment. If a dash follows the slash
      then the damage reduction is effective against any attack that does not ignore damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon
      for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an
      alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already have).
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever damage reduction completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates most special effects that
      accompany the attack, such as injury type poison, a monk’s stunning, and injury type disease. Damage reduction
      does not negate touch attacks, energy damage dealt along with an attack, or energy drains. Nor does it affect
      poisons or diseases delivered by inhalation, ingestion, or contact.
    </p>
    <p>Attacks that deal no damage because of the target’s damage reduction do not disrupt spells.</p>
    <p>Spells, spell-like abilities, and energy attacks (even nonmagical fire) ignore damage reduction.</p>
    <p>
      Sometimes damage reduction is instant healing. Sometimes damage reduction represents the creature’s tough hide or
      body,. In either case, characters can see that conventional attacks don’t work.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a creature has damage reduction from more than one source, the two forms of damage reduction do not stack.
      Instead, the creature gets the benefit of the best damage reduction in a given situation.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--darkvision">Darkvision</h3>
    <p>
      Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the
      creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see
      anything that they could not see otherwise—invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible
      as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light
      does not spoil darkvision.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--death-attacks">Death Attacks</h3>
    <p>
      In most cases, a death attack allows the victim a Fortitude save to avoid the affect, but if the save fails, the
      character dies instantly.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Raise dead</i> doesn’t work on someone killed by a death attack.</li>
      <li>Death attacks slay instantly. A victim cannot be made stable and thereby kept alive.</li>
      <li>In case it matters, a dead character, no matter how she died, has –10 hit points.</li>
      <li>The spell <i>death ward</i> protects a character against these attacks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--disease">Disease</h3>
    <p>
      When a character is injured by a contaminated attack touches an item smeared with diseased matter, or consumes
      disease-tainted food or drink, he must make an immediate Fortitude saving throw. If he succeeds, the disease has
      no effect—his immune system fought off the infection. If he fails, he takes damage after an incubation period.
      Once per day afterward, he must make a successful Fortitude saving throw to avoid repeated damage. Two successful
      saving throws in a row indicate that he has fought off the disease and recovers, taking no more damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Fortitude saving throws can be rolled secretly so that the player doesn’t know whether the disease has taken
      hold.
    </p>
    <h4 id="special-abilities--disease--disease-descriptions">Disease Descriptions</h4>
    <p>
      Diseases have various symptoms and are spread through a number of vectors. The characteristics of several typical
      diseases are summarized on Table: Diseases and defined below.

    <h4 id="special-abilities--disease--healing-a-disease">Healing a Disease</h4>
    <p>
      Use of the Heal skill can help a diseased character. Every time a diseased character makes a saving throw against
      disease effects, the healer makes a check. The diseased character can use the healer’s result in place of his
      saving throw if the Heal check result is higher. The diseased character must be in the healer’s care and must have
      spent the previous 8 hours resting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters recover points lost to ability score damage at a rate of 1 per day per ability damaged, and this rule
      applies even while a disease is in progress. That means that a character with a minor disease might be able to
      withstand it without accumulating any damage.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--energy-drain-and-negative-levels">Energy Drain and Negative Levels</h3>
    <p>
      Some horrible creatures, especially undead monsters, possess a fearsome supernatural ability to drain levels from
      those they strike in combat. The creature making an energy drain attack draws a portion of its victim’s life force
      from her. Most energy drain attacks require a successful melee attack roll—mere physical contact is not enough.
      Each successful energy drain attack bestows one or more negative levels on the opponent. A creature takes the
      following penalties for each negative level it has gained.
    </p>
    <p>–1 on all skill checks and ability checks.</p>
    <p>–1 on attack rolls and saving throws.</p>
    <p>–5 hit points.</p>
    <p>
      –1 effective level (whenever the creature’s level is used in a die roll or calculation, reduce it by one for each
      negative level).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the victim casts spells, she loses access to one spell as if she had cast her highest-level, currently
      available spell. (If she has more than one spell at her highest level, she chooses which she loses.) In addition,
      when she next prepares spells or regains spell slots, she gets one less spell slot at her highest spell level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Negative levels remain for 24 hours or until removed with a spell, such as
      <i>restoration.</i> After 24 hours, the afflicted creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 attacker’s
      HD + attacker’s Cha modifier). (The DC is provided in the attacker’s description.) If the saving throw succeeds,
      the negative level goes away with no harm to the creature. The afflicted creature makes a separate saving throw
      for each negative level it has gained. If the save fails, the negative level goes away, but the creature’s level
      is also reduced by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character with negative levels at least equal to her current level, or drained below 1st level, is instantly
      slain. Depending on the creature that killed her, she may rise the next night as a monster of that kind. If not,
      she rises as a wight. A creature gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level it bestows (though not if
      the negative level is caused by a spell or similar effect).
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--etherealness">Etherealness</h3>
    <p>
      Phase spiders and certain other creatures can exist on the Ethereal Plane. While on the Ethereal Plane, a creature
      is called ethereal. Unlike incorporeal creatures, ethereal creatures are not present on the Material Plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethereal creatures are invisible, inaudible, insubstantial, and scentless to creatures on the Material Plane. Even
      most magical attacks have no effect on them. <i>See invisibility</i> and <i>true seeing</i> reveal ethereal
      creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ethereal creature can see and hear into the Material Plane in a 60-foot radius, though material objects still
      block sight and sound. (An ethereal creature can’t see through a material wall, for instance.) An ethereal
      creature inside an object on the Material Plane cannot see. Things on the Material Plane, however, look gray,
      indistinct, and ghostly. An ethereal creature can’t affect the Material Plane, not even magically. An ethereal
      creature, however, interacts with other ethereal creatures and objects the way material creatures interact with
      material creatures and objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if a creature on the Material Plane can see an ethereal creature the ethereal creature is on another plane.
      Only force effects can affect the ethereal creatures. If, on the other hand, both creatures are ethereal, they can
      affect each other normally.
    </p>
    <p>
      A force effect originating on the Material Plane extends onto the Ethereal Plane, so that a
      <i>wall of force</i> blocks an ethereal creature, and a <i>magic missile</i> can strike one (provided the
      spellcaster can see the ethereal target). Gaze effects and abjurations also extend from the Material Plane to the
      Ethereal Plane. None of these effects extend from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethereal creatures move in any direction (including up or down) at will. They do not need to walk on the ground,
      and material objects don’t block them (though they can’t see while their eyes are within solid material).
    </p>
    <p>
      Ghosts have a power called manifestation that allows them to appear on the Material Plane as incorporeal
      creatures. Still, they are on the Ethereal Plane, and another ethereal creature can interact normally with a
      manifesting ghost. Ethereal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as air. Ethereal creatures do
      not fall or take falling damage.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--evasion-and-improved-evasion">Evasion and Improved Evasion</h3>
    <p>
      These extraordinary abilities allow the target of an area attack to leap or twist out of the way. Rogues and monks
      have evasion and improved evasion as class features, but certain other creatures have these abilities, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      If subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, a character with evasion takes no damage on a
      successful save.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with a Reflex save for any creature, a character must have room to move in order to evade. A bound character or
      one squeezing through an area cannot use evasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with a Reflex save for any creature, evasion is a reflexive ability. The character need not know that the
      attack is coming to use evasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogues and monks cannot use evasion in medium or heavy armor. Some creatures with the evasion ability as an innate
      quality do not have this limitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Improved evasion is like evasion, except that even on a failed saving throw the character takes only half damage.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--fast-healing">Fast Healing</h3>
    <p>
      A creature with fast healing has the extraordinary ability to regain hit points at an exceptional rate. Except for
      what is noted here, fast healing is like natural healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of each of the creature’s turns, it heals a certain number of hit points (defined in its
      description).
    </p>
    <p>Unlike regeneration, fast healing does not allow a creature to regrow or reattach lost body parts.</p>
    <p>A creature that has taken both nonlethal and lethal damage heals the nonlethal damage first.</p>
    <p>Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation.</p>
    <p>Fast healing does not increase the number of hit points regained when a creature polymorphs.</p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--fear">Fear</h3>
    <p>
      Spells, magic items, and certain monsters can affect characters with fear. In most cases, the character makes a
      Will saving throw to resist this effect, and a failed roll means that the character is shaken, frightened, or
      panicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--fear--shaken">Shaken:</strong> Characters who are shaken take a –2 penalty on
      attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--fear--frightened">Frightened:</strong> Characters who are frightened are shaken,
      and in addition they flee from the source of their fear as quickly as they can. They can choose the path of their
      flight. Other than that stipulation, once they are out of sight (or hearing) of the source of their fear, they can
      act as they want. However, if the duration of their fear continues, characters can be forced to flee once more if
      the source of their fear presents itself again. Characters unable to flee can fight (though they are still
      shaken).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--fear--panicked">Panicked:</strong> Characters who are panicked are shaken, and they
      run away from the source of their fear as quickly as they can. Other than running away from the source, their path
      is random. They flee from all other dangers that confront them rather than facing those dangers. Panicked
      characters cower if they are prevented from fleeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--fear--becoming-even-more-fearful">Becoming Even More Fearful:</strong> Fear effects
      are cumulative. A shaken character who is made shaken again becomes frightened, and a shaken character who is made
      frightened becomes panicked instead. A frightened character who is made shaken or frightened becomes panicked
      instead.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--fire-immunity">Fire Immunity</h3>
    <p>
      A creature with fire immunity never takes fire damage. It has vulnerability to cold, which means it takes half
      again as much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save
      is a success or failure.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--gaseous-form">Gaseous Form</h3>
    <p>Some creatures have the supernatural or spell-like ability to take the form of a cloud of vapor or gas.</p>
    <p>
      Creatures in gaseous form can’t run but can fly. A gaseous creature can move about and do the things that a cloud
      of gas can conceivably do, such as flow through the crack under a door. It can’t, however, pass through solid
      matter. Gaseous creatures can’t attack physically or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus
      components. They lose their supernatural abilities (except for the supernatural ability to assume gaseous form, of
      course).
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures in gaseous form have damage reduction 10/magic. Spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities
      affect them normally. Creatures in gaseous form lose all benefit of material armor (including natural armor),
      though size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force armor still apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaseous creatures do not need to breathe and are immune to attacks involving breathing (troglodyte stench, poison
      gas, and the like).
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaseous creatures can’t enter water or other liquid. They are not ethereal or incorporeal. They are affected by
      winds or other forms of moving air to the extent that the wind pushes them in the direction the wind is moving.
      However, even the strongest wind can’t disperse or damage a creature in gaseous form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discerning a creature in gaseous form from natural mist requires a DC 15 Spot check. Creatures in gaseous form
      attempting to hide in an area with mist, smoke, or other gas gain a +20 bonus.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--gaze-attacks">Gaze Attacks</h3>
    <p>
      While the medusa’s gaze is well known, gaze attacks can also charm, curse, or even kill. Gaze attacks not produced
      by a spell are supernatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each character within range of a gaze attack must attempt a saving throw (which can be a Fortitude or Will save)
      each round at the beginning of his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      An opponent can avert his eyes from the creature’s face, looking at the creature’s body, watching its shadow, or
      tracking the creature in a reflective surface. Each round, the opponent has a 50% chance of not having to make a
      saving throw. The creature with the gaze attack gains concealment relative to the opponent. An opponent can shut
      his eyes, turn his back on the creature, or wear a blindfold. In these cases, the opponent does not need to make a
      saving throw. The creature with the gaze attack gains total concealment relative to the opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature with a gaze attack can actively attempt to use its gaze as an attack action. The creature simply
      chooses a target within range, and that opponent must attempt a saving throw. If the target has chosen to defend
      against the gaze as discussed above, the opponent gets a chance to avoid the saving throw (either 50% chance for
      averting eyes or 100% chance for shutting eyes). It is possible for an opponent to save against a creature’s gaze
      twice during the same round, once before its own action and once during the creature’s action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the creature’s image (such as in a mirror or as part of an illusion) does not subject the viewer to a
      gaze attack.
    </p>
    <p>A creature is immune to its own gaze attack.</p>
    <p>
      If visibility is limited (by dim lighting, a fog, or the like) so that it results in concealment, there is a
      percentage chance equal to the normal miss chance for that degree of concealment that a character won’t need to
      make a saving throw in a given round. This chance is not cumulative with the chance for averting your eyes, but is
      rolled separately.
    </p>
    <p>Invisible creatures cannot use gaze attacks.</p>
    <p>Characters using darkvision in complete darkness are affected by a gaze attack normally.</p>
    <p>
      Unless specified otherwise, a creature with a gaze attack can control its gaze attack and “turn it off ” when so
      desired.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--incorporeality">Incorporeality</h3>
    <p>
      Spectres, wraiths, and a few other creatures lack physical bodies. Such creatures are insubstantial and can’t be
      touched by nonmagical matter or energy. Likewise, they cannot manipulate objects or exert physical force on
      objects. However, incorporeal beings have a tangible presence that sometimes seems like a physical attack against
      a corporeal creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incorporeal creatures are present on the same plane as the characters, and characters have some chance to affect
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incorporeal creatures can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, by magic weapons, or by spells,
      spell-like effects, or supernatural effects. They are immune to all nonmagical attack forms. They are not burned
      by normal fires, affected by natural cold, or harmed by mundane acids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when struck by magic or magic weapons, an incorporeal creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a
      corporeal source—except for a force effector damage dealt by a ghost touch weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incorporeal creatures are immune to critical hits, extra damage from being favored enemies, and from sneak
      attacks. They move in any direction (including up or down) at will. They do not need to walk on the ground. They
      can pass through solid objects at will, although they cannot see when their eyes are within solid matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incorporeal creatures hiding inside solid objects get a +2 circumstance bonus on Listen checks, because solid
      objects carry sound well. Pinpointing an opponent from inside a solid object uses the same rules as pinpointing
      invisible opponents (see Invisibility, below).
    </p>
    <p>Incorporeal creatures are inaudible unless they decide to make noise.</p>
    <p>
      The physical attacks of incorporeal creatures ignore material armor, even magic armor, unless it is made of force
      (such as mage armor or bracers of armor) or has the ghost touch ability.
    </p>
    <p>Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as they do in air.</p>
    <p>Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take falling damage.</p>
    <p>Corporeal creatures cannot trip or grapple incorporeal creatures.</p>
    <p>Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.</p>
    <p>
      Incorporeal creatures do not leave footprints, have no scent, and make no noise unless they manifest, and even
      then they only make noise intentionally.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--invisibility">Invisibility</h3>
    <p>
      The ability to move about unseen is not foolproof. While they can’t be seen, invisible creatures can be heard,
      smelled, or felt.
    </p>
    <p>Invisibility makes a creature undetectable by vision, including darkvision.</p>
    <p>
      Invisibility does not, by itself, make a creature immune to critical hits, but it does make the creature immune to
      extra damage from being a ranger’s favored enemy and from sneak attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature can generally notice the presence of an active invisible creature within 30 feet with a DC 20 Spot
      check. The observer gains a hunch that “something’s there” but can’t see it or target it accurately with an
      attack. A creature who is holding still is very hard to notice (DC 30). An inanimate object, an unliving creature
      holding still, or a completely immobile creature is even harder to spot (DC 40). It’s practically impossible (+20
      DC) to pinpoint an invisible creature’s location with a Spot check, and even if a character succeeds on such a
      check, the invisible creature still benefits from total concealment (50% miss chance).
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature can use hearing to find an invisible creature. A character can make a Listen check for this purpose as
      a free action each round. A Listen check result at least equal to the invisible creature’s Move Silently check
      result reveals its presence. (A creature with no ranks in Move Silently makes a Move Silently check as a Dexterity
      check to which an armor check penalty applies.) A successful check lets a character hear an invisible creature
      “over there somewhere.” It’s practically impossible to pinpoint the location of an invisible creature. A Listen
      check that beats the DC by 20 pinpoints the invisible creature’s location.

    <p>
      A creature can grope about to find an invisible creature. A character can make a touch attack with his hands or a
      weapon into two adjacent 5-foot squares using a standard action. If an invisible target is in the designated area,
      there is a 50% miss chance on the touch attack. If successful, the groping character deals no damage but has
      successfully pinpointed the invisible creature’s current location. (If the invisible creature moves, its location,
      obviously, is once again unknown.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If an invisible creature strikes a character, the character struck still knows the location of the creature that
      struck him (until, of course, the invisible creature moves). The only exception is if the invisible creature has a
      reach greater than 5 feet. In this case, the struck character knows the general location of the creature but has
      not pinpointed the exact location.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has pinpointed, he attacks normally, but
      the invisible creature still benefits from full concealment (and thus a 50% miss chance). A particularly large and
      slow creature might get a smaller miss chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has not pinpointed, have the player choose
      the space where the character will direct the attack. If the invisible creature is there, conduct the attack
      normally. If the enemy’s not there, roll the miss chance as if it were there, don’t let the player see the result,
      and tell him that the character has missed. That way the player doesn’t know whether the attack missed because the
      enemy’s not there or because you successfully rolled the miss chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an invisible character picks up a visible object, the object remains visible. One could coat an invisible
      object with flour to at least keep track of its position (until the flour fell off or blew away). An invisible
      creature can pick up a small visible item and hide it on his person (tucked in a pocket or behind a cloak) and
      render it effectively invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Invisible creatures leave tracks. They can be tracked normally. Footprints in sand, mud, or other soft surfaces
      can give enemies clues to an invisible creature’s location.
    </p>
    <p>
      An invisible creature in the water displaces water, revealing its location. The invisible creature, however, is
      still hard to see and benefits from concealment.
    </p>
    <p>A creature with the scent ability can detect an invisible creature as it would a visible one.</p>
    <p>
      A creature with the Blind-Fight feat has a better chance to hit an invisible creature. Roll the miss chance twice,
      and he misses only if both rolls indicate a miss. (Alternatively, make one 25% miss chance roll rather than two
      50% miss chance rolls.)
    </p>
    <p>A creature with blindsight can attack (and otherwise interact with) creatures regardless of invisibility.</p>
    <p>
      An invisible burning torch still gives off light, as does an invisible object with a light spell (or similar
      spell) cast upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethereal creatures are invisible. Since ethereal creatures are not materially present, Spot checks, Listen checks,
      Scent, Blind-Fight, and blindsight don’t help locate them. Incorporeal creatures are often invisible. Scent,
      Blind-Fight, and blindsight don’t help creatures find or attack invisible, incorporeal creatures, but Spot checks
      and possibly Listen checks can help.
    </p>
    <p>Invisible creatures cannot use gaze attacks.</p>
    <p>Invisibility does not thwart <i>detect</i> spells.</p>
    <p>
      Since some creatures can detect or even see invisible creatures, it is helpful to be able to hide even when
      invisible.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--level-loss">Level Loss</h3>
    <p>
      A character who loses a level instantly loses one Hit Die. The character’s base attack bonus, base saving throw
      bonuses, and special class abilities are now reduced to the new, lower level. Likewise, the character loses any
      ability score gain, skill ranks, and any feat associated with the level (if applicable). If the exact ability
      score or skill ranks increased from a level now lost is unknown (or the player has forgotten), lose 1 point from
      the highest ability score or ranks from the highest-ranked skills. If a familiar or companion creature has
      abilities tied to a character who has lost a level, the creature’s abilities are adjusted to fit the character’s
      new level.
    </p>
    <p>The victim’s experience point total is immediately set to the midpoint of the previous level.</p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--low-light-vision">Low-Light Vision</h3>
    <p>
      Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal
      in dim light. Low-light vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as
      even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light.
    </p>
    <p>Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.</p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--paralysis">Paralysis</h3>
    <p>
      Some monsters and spells have the supernatural or spell-like ability to paralyze their victims, immobilizing them
      through magical means. (Paralysis from toxins is discussed in the Poison section below.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A paralyzed character cannot move, speak, or take any physical action. He is rooted to the spot, frozen and
      helpless. Not even friends can move his limbs. He may take purely mental actions, such as casting a spell with no
      components.
    </p>
    <p>
      A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A
      swimmer can’t swim and may drown.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--poison">Poison</h3>
    <p>
      When a character takes damage from an attack with a poisoned weapon, touches an item smeared with contact poison,
      consumes poisoned food or drink, or is otherwise poisoned, he must make a Fortitude saving throw. If he fails, he
      takes the poison’s initial damage (usually ability damage). Even if he succeeds, he typically faces more damage 1
      minute later, which he can also avoid with a successful Fortitude saving throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      One dose of poison smeared on a weapon or some other object affects just a single target. A poisoned weapon or
      object retains its venom until the weapon scores a hit or the object is touched (unless the poison is wiped off
      before a target comes in contact with it). Any poison smeared on an object or exposed to the elements in any way
      remains potent until it is touched or used.
    </p>
    <p>Although supernatural and spell-like poisons are possible, poisonous effects are almost always extraordinary.</p>
    <p>
      Poisons can be divided into four basic types according to the method by which their effect is delivered, as
      follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--poison--contact">Contact:</strong> Merely touching this type of poison necessitates
      a saving throw. It can be actively delivered via a weapon or a touch attack. Even if a creature has sufficient
      damage reduction to avoid taking any damage from the attack, the poison can still affect it. A chest or other
      object can be smeared with contact poison as part of a trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--poison--ingested">Ingested:</strong> Ingested poisons are virtually impossible to
      utilize in a combat situation. A poisoner could administer a potion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe
      someone into drinking or eating something poisoned. Assassins and other characters tend to use ingested poisons
      outside of combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--poison--inhaled">Inhaled:</strong> Inhaled poisons are usually contained in fragile
      vials or eggshells. They can be thrown as a ranged attack with a range increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a
      hard surface (or is struck hard), the container releases its poison. One dose spreads to fill the volume of a
      10-foot cube. Each creature within the area must make a saving throw. (Holding one’s breath is ineffective against
      inhaled poisons; they affect the nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--poison--injury">Injury:</strong> This poison must be delivered through a wound. If
      a creature has sufficient damage reduction to avoid taking any damage from the attack, the poison does not affect
      it. Traps that cause damage from weapons, needles, and the like sometimes contain injury poisons.
    </p>
    <p>The characteristics of poisons are summarized on Table: Poisons. Terms on the table are defined below.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="special-abilities--poison--injury--type">Type:</em> The poison’s method of delivery (contact, ingested,
      inhaled, or via an injury) and the Fortitude save DC to avoid the poison’s damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="special-abilities--poison--injury--initial-damage">Initial Damage:</em> The damage the character takes
      immediately upon failing his saving throw against this poison. Ability damage is temporary unless marked with an
      asterisk (*), in which case the loss is a permanent drain. Paralysis lasts for 2d6 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="special-abilities--poison--injury--secondary-damage">Secondary Damage:</em> The amount of damage the
      character takes 1 minute after exposure as a result of the poisoning, if he fails a second saving throw.
      Unconsciousness lasts for 1d3 hours. Ability damage marked with an asterisk is permanent drain instead of
      temporary damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="special-abilities--poison--injury--price">Price:</em> The cost of one dose (one vial) of the poison. It is
      not possible to use or apply poison in any quantity smaller than one dose. The purchase and possession of poison
      is always illegal, and even in big cities it can be obtained only from specialized, less than reputable sources.
    </p>
    <h4 id="special-abilities--poison--perils-of-using-poison">Perils of Using Poison</h4>
    <p>
      A character has a 5% chance of exposing himself to a poison whenever he applies it to a weapon or otherwise
      readies it for use. Additionally, a character who rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned weapon must
      make a DC 15 Reflex save or accidentally poison himself with the weapon.
    </p>
    <h4 id="special-abilities--poison--poison-immunities">Poison Immunities</h4>
    <p>
      Creatures with natural poison attacks are immune to their own poison. Nonliving creatures (constructs and undead)
      and creatures without metabolisms (such as elementals) are always immune to poison. Oozes, plants, and certain
      kinds of outsiders are also immune to poison, although conceivably special poisons could be concocted specifically
      to harm them.

    <h3 id="special-abilities--polymorph">Polymorph</h3>
    <p>
      Magic can cause creatures and characters to change their shapes—sometimes against their will, but usually to gain
      an advantage. Polymorphed creatures retain their own minds but have new physical forms.
    </p>
    <p>The <i>polymorph</i> spell defines the general polymorph effect.</p>
    <p>
      Since creatures do not change types, a slaying or bane weapon designed to kill or harm creatures of a specific
      type affects those creatures even if they are polymorphed. Likewise, a creature polymorphed into the form of a
      creature of a different type is not subject to slaying and bane effects directed at that type of creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ranger’s favored enemy bonus is based on knowing what the foe is, so if a creature that is a ranger’s favored
      enemy polymorphs into another form, the ranger is denied his bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dwarf ’s bonus for fighting giants is based on shape and size, so he does not gain a bonus against a giant
      polymorphed into something else, but does gain the bonus against any creature polymorphed into a giant.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--psionics">Psionics</h3>
    <p>
      Telepathy, mental combat and psychic powers—psionics is a catchall word that describes special mental abilities
      possessed by various creatures. These are spell-like abilities that a creature generates from the power of its
      mind alone—no other outside magical force or ritual is needed. Each psionic creature’s description contains
      details on its psionic abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psionic attacks almost always allow Will saving throws to resist them. However, not all psionic attacks are mental
      attacks. Some psionic abilities allow the psionic creature to reshape its own body, heal its wounds, or teleport
      great distances. Some psionic creatures can see into the future, the past, and the present (in far-off locales) as
      well as read the minds of others.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--rays">Rays</h3>
    <p>
      All ray attacks require the attacker to make a successful ranged touch attack against the target. Rays have
      varying ranges, which are simple maximums. A ray’s attack roll never takes a range penalty. Even if a ray hits, it
      usually allows the target to make a saving throw (Fortitude or Will). Rays never allow a Reflex saving throw, but
      if a character’s Dexterity bonus to AC is high, it might be hard to hit her with the ray in the first place.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--regeneration">Regeneration</h3>
    <p>
      Creatures with this extraordinary ability recover from wounds quickly and can even regrow or reattach severed body
      parts. Damage dealt to the creature is treated as nonlethal damage, and the creature automatically cures itself of
      nonlethal damage at a fixed rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, deal damage to the creature normally; that sort of damage doesn’t
      convert to nonlethal damage and so doesn’t go away. The creature’s description includes the details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures with regeneration can regrow lost portions of their bodies and can reattach severed limbs or body parts.
      Severed parts die if they are not reattached.
    </p>
    <p>Regeneration does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation.</p>
    <p>Attack forms that don’t deal hit point damage ignore regeneration.</p>
    <p>
      An attack that can cause instant death only threatens the creature with death if it is delivered by weapons that
      deal it lethal damage.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--resistance-to-energy">Resistance to Energy</h3>
    <p>
      A creature with resistance to energy has the ability (usually extraordinary) to ignore some damage of a certain
      type each round, but it does not have total immunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each resistance ability is defined by what energy type it resists and how many points of damage are resisted. It
      doesn’t matter whether the damage has a mundane or magical source.
    </p>
    <p>
      When resistance completely negates the damage from an energy attack, the attack does not disrupt a spell. This
      resistance does not stack with the resistance that a spellmight provide.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--scent">Scent</h3>
    <p>
      This extraordinary ability lets a creature detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense
      of smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature with the scent ability can detect opponents by sense of smell, generally within 30 feet. If the
      opponent is upwind, the range is 60 feet. If it is downwind, the range is 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or
      rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or
      troglodyte stench, can be detected at three times these ranges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creature detects another creature’s presence but not its specific location. Noting the direction of the scent
      is a move action. If it moves within 5 feet of the scent’s source, the creature can pinpoint that source.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature with the Track feat and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom check to find or
      follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10. The DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the
      quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC
      increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the
      effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.
    </p>
    <p>Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.</p>
    <p>
      Water, particularly running water, ruins a trail for air-breathing creatures. Water-breathing creatures that have
      the scent ability, however, can use it in the water easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      False, powerful odors can easily mask other scents. The presence of such an odor completely spoils the ability to
      properly detect or identify creatures, and the base Survival DC to track becomes 20 rather than 10.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--spell-resistance">Spell Resistance</h3>
    <p>
      Spell resistance is the extraordinary ability to avoid being affected by spells. (Some spells also grant spell
      resistance.)
    </p>
    <p>
      To affect a creature that has spell resistance, a spellcaster must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level)
      at least equal to the creature’s spell resistance. (The defender’s spell resistance is like an Armor Class against
      magical attacks.) If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn’t affect the creature. The possessor does not
      have to do anything special to use spell resistance. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for its
      spell resistance to operate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only spells and spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance. Extraordinary and supernatural abilities
      (including enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are not. A creature can have some abilities that are subject to
      spell resistance and some that are not. Even some spells ignore spell resistance; see When Spell Resistance
      Applies, below.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature can voluntarily lower its spell resistance. Doing so is a standard action that does not provoke an
      attack of opportunity. Once a creature lowers its resistance, it remains down until the creature’s next turn. At
      the beginning of the creature’s next turn, the creature’s spell resistance automatically returns unless the
      creature intentionally keeps it down (also a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity).
    </p>
    <p>A creature’s spell resistance never interferes with its own spells, items, or abilities.</p>
    <p>
      A creature with spell resistance cannot impart this power to others by touching them or standing in their midst.
      Only the rarest of creatures and a few magic items have the ability to bestow spell resistance upon another.
    </p>
    <p>Spell resistance does not stack. It overlaps.</p>
    <h4 id="special-abilities--spell-resistance--when-spell-resistance-applies">When Spell Resistance Applies</h4>
    <p>
      Each spell includes an entry that indicates whether spell resistance applies to the spell. In general, whether
      spell resistance applies depends on what the spell does:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--spell-resistance--when-spell-resistance-applies--targeted-spells"
        >Targeted Spells:</strong
      >
      Spell resistance applies if the spell is targeted at the creature. Some individually targeted spells can be
      directed at several creatures simultaneously. In such cases, a creature’s spell resistance applies only to the
      portion of the spell actually targeted at that creature. If several different resistant creatures are subjected to
      such a spell, each checks its spell resistance separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--spell-resistance--when-spell-resistance-applies--area-spells">Area Spells:</strong>
      Spell resistance applies if the resistant creature is within the spell’s area. It protects the resistant creature
      without affecting the spell itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--spell-resistance--when-spell-resistance-applies--effect-spells"
        >Effect Spells:</strong
      >
      Most effect spells summon or create something and are not subject to spell resistance. Sometimes, however, spell
      resistance applies to effect spells, usually to those that act upon a creature more or less directly, such as
      <i>web.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Spell resistance can protect a creature from a spell that’s already been cast. Check spell resistance when the
      creature is first affected by the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check spell resistance only once for any particular casting of a spell or use of a spell-like ability. If spell
      resistance fails the first time, it fails each time the creature encounters that same casting of the spell.
      Likewise, if the spell resistance succeeds the first time, it always succeeds. If the creature has voluntarily
      lowered its spell resistance and is then subjected to a spell, the creature still has a single chance to resist
      that spell later, when its spell resistance is up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spell resistance has no effect unless the energy created or released by the spell actually goes to work on the
      resistant creature’s mind or body. If the spell acts on anything else and the creature is affected as a
      consequence, no roll is required. Creatures can be harmed by a spell without being directly affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spell resistance does not apply if an effect fools the creature’s senses or reveals something about the creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magic actually has to be working for spell resistance to apply. Spells that have instantaneous durations but
      lasting results aren’t subject to spell resistance unless the resistant creature is exposed to the spell the
      instant it is cast.
    </p>
    <p>When in doubt about whether a spell’s effect is direct or indirect, consider the spell’s school:</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--spell-resistance--when-spell-resistance-applies--abjuration">Abjuration:</strong>
      The target creature must be harmed, changed, or restricted in some manner for spell resistance to apply.
      Perception changes aren’t subject to spell resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abjurations that block or negate attacks are not subject to an attacker’s spell resistance—it is the protected
      creature that is affected by the spell (becoming immune or resistant to the attack).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--spell-resistance--when-spell-resistance-applies--conjuration">Conjuration:</strong>
      These spells are usually not subject to spell resistance unless the spell conjures some form of energy. Spells
      that summon creatures or produce effects that function like creatures are not subject to spell resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--spell-resistance--when-spell-resistance-applies--divination">Divination:</strong>
      These spells do not affect creatures directly and are not subject to spell resistance, even though what they
      reveal about a creature might be very damaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--spell-resistance--when-spell-resistance-applies--enchantment">Enchantment:</strong>
      Since enchantment spells affect creatures’ minds, they are typically subject to spell resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--spell-resistance--when-spell-resistance-applies--evocation">Evocation:</strong> If
      an evocation spell deals damage to the creature, it has a direct effect. If the spell damages something else, it
      has an indirect effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--spell-resistance--when-spell-resistance-applies--illusion">Illusion:</strong> These
      spells are almost never subject to spell resistance. Illusions that entail a direct attack are exceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--spell-resistance--when-spell-resistance-applies--necromancy">Necromancy:</strong>
      Most of these spells alter the target creature’s life force and are subject to spell resistance. Unusual
      necromancy spells that don’t affect other creatures directly are not subject to spell resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="special-abilities--spell-resistance--when-spell-resistance-applies--transmutation"
        >Transmutation:</strong
      >
      These spells are subject to spell resistance if they transform the target creature. Transmutation spells are not
      subject to spell resistance if they are targeted on a point in space instead of on a creature. Some transmutations
      make objects harmful (or more harmful), such as <i>magic stone</i>. Even these spells are not generally subject to
      spell resistance because they affect the objects, not the creatures against which the objects are used. Spell
      resistance works against <i>magic stone</i> only if the creature with spell resistance is holding the stones when
      the cleric casts <i>magic stone</i> on them.
    </p>
    <h4 id="special-abilities--spell-resistance--successful-spell-resistance">Successful Spell Resistance</h4>
    <p>
      Spell resistance prevents a spell or a spell-like ability from affecting or harming the resistant creature, but it
      never removes a magical effect from another creature or negates a spell’s effect on another creature. Spell
      resistance prevents a spell from disrupting another spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against an ongoing spell that has already been cast, a failed check against spell resistance allows the resistant
      creature to ignore any effect the spell might have. The magic continues to affect others normally.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--tremorsense">Tremorsense</h3>
    <p>
      A creature with tremorsense automatically senses the location of anything that is in contact with the ground and
      within range.
    </p>
    <p>
      If no straight path exists through the ground from the creature to those that it’s sensing, then the range defines
      the maximum distance of the shortest indirect path. It must itself be in contact with the ground, and the
      creatures must be moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as the other creatures are taking physical actions, including casting spells with somatic components,
      they’re considered moving; they don’t have to move from place to place for a creature with tremorsense to detect
      them.
    </p>
    <h3 id="special-abilities--turn-resistance">Turn Resistance</h3>
    <p>Some creatures (usually undead) are less easily affected by the turning ability of clerics or paladins.</p>
    <p>Turn resistance is an extraordinary ability.</p>
    <p>
      When resolving a turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempt, added the appropriate bonus to the creature’s Hit Dice
      total.
    </p>
    <h2 id="conditions">Conditions</h2>
    <p>
      If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If certain effects can’t combine, apply the most
      severe effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--ability-damaged">Ability Damaged:</strong> The character has temporarily lost 1 or more
      ability score points. Lost points return at a rate of 1 per day unless noted otherwise by the condition dealing
      the damage. A character with Strength 0 falls to the ground and is helpless. A character with Dexterity 0 is
      paralyzed. A character with Constitution 0 is dead. A character with Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 0 is
      unconscious. Ability damage is different from penalties to ability scores, which go away when the conditions
      causing them go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--ability-drained">Ability Drained:</strong> The character has permanently lost 1 or more
      ability score points. The character can regain these points only through magical means. A character with Strength
      0 falls to the ground and is helpless. A character with Dexterity 0 is paralyzed. A character with Constitution 0
      is dead. A character with Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 0 is unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--blinded">Blinded:</strong> The character cannot see. He takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class,
      loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), moves at half speed, and takes a –4 penalty on Search checks and on most
      Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks. All checks and activities that rely on vision (such as reading and
      Spot checks) automatically fail. All opponents are considered to have total concealment (50% miss chance) to the
      blinded character. Characters who remain blinded for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can
      overcome some of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--blown-away">Blown Away:</strong> Depending on its size, a creature can be blown away by
      winds of high velocity. A creature on the ground that is blown away is knocked down and rolls 1d4 x 10 feet,
      taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. A flying creature that is blown away is blown back 2d6 x 10
      feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--checked">Checked:</strong> Prevented from achieving forward motion by an applied force,
      such as wind. Checked creatures on the ground merely stop. Checked flying creatures move back a distance specified
      in the description of the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--confused"><i>Confused:</i></strong
      >A <i>confused</i> character’s actions are determined by rolling d% at the beginning of his turn: 01–10, attack
      caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attacking is not possible); 11–20, act normally;
      21–50, do nothing but babble incoherently; 51–70, flee away from caster at top possible speed; 71–100, attack
      nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject’s self ). A <i>confused</i> character
      who can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special
      advantage when attacking a <i>confused</i> character. Any <i>confused</i> character who is attacked automatically
      attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still <i>confused</i> when its turn comes. A
      <i>confused</i> character does not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted
      to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--cowering">Cowering:</strong> The character is frozen in fear and can take no actions. A
      cowering character takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class and loses her Dexterity bonus (if any).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--dazed">Dazed:</strong> The creature is unable to act normally. A dazed creature can take
      no actions, but has no penalty to AC.
    </p>
    <p>A dazed condition typically lasts 1 round.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--dazzled">Dazzled:</strong> The creature is unable to see well because of overstimulation
      of the eyes. A dazzled creature takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls, Search checks, and Spot checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--dead">Dead:</strong> The character’s hit points are reduced to –10, his Constitution drops
      to 0, or he is killed outright by a spell or effect. The character’s soul leaves his body. Dead characters cannot
      benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be restored to life via magic. A dead body decays normally
      unless magically preserved, but magic that restores a dead character to life also restores the body either to full
      health or to its condition at the time of death (depending on the spell or device). Either way, resurrected
      characters need not worry about rigor mortis, decomposition, and other conditions that affect dead bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--deafened">Deafened:</strong> A deafened character cannot hear. She takes a –4 penalty on
      initiative checks, automatically fails Listen checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells
      with verbal components. Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can
      overcome some of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--disabled">Disabled:</strong> A character with 0 hit points, or one who has negative hit
      points but has become stable and conscious, is disabled. A disabled character may take a single move action or
      standard action each round (but not both, nor can she take full-round actions). She moves at half speed. Taking
      move actions doesn’t risk further injury, but performing any standard action (or any other action the DM deems
      strenuous, including some free actions such as casting a quickened spell) deals 1 point of damage after the
      completion of the act. Unless the action increased the disabled character’s hit points, she is now in negative hit
      points and dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      A disabled character with negative hit points recovers hit points naturally if she is being helped. Otherwise,
      each day she has a 10% chance to start recovering hit points naturally (starting with that day); otherwise, she
      loses 1 hit point. Once an unaided character starts recovering hit points naturally, she is no longer in danger of
      losing hit points (even if her current hit points are negative).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--dying">Dying:</strong> A dying character is unconscious and near death. She has –1 to –9
      current hit points. A dying character can take no actions and is unconscious. At the end of each round (starting
      with the round in which the character dropped below 0 hit points), the character rolls d% to see whether she
      becomes stable. She has a 10% chance to become stable. If she does not, she loses 1 hit point. If a dying
      character reaches –10 hit points, she is dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--energy-drained">Energy Drained:</strong> The character gains one or more negative levels,
      which might permanently drain the character’s levels. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit
      Dice, he dies. Each negative level gives a creature the following penalties: –1 penalty on attack rolls, saving
      throws, skill checks, ability checks; loss of 5 hit points; and –1 to effective level (for determining the power,
      duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). In addition, a spellcaster loses one spell or
      spell slot from the highest spell level castable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--entangled">Entangled:</strong> The character is ensnared. Being entangled impedes
      movement, but does not entirely prevent it unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an
      opposing force. An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a –2 penalty on all
      attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a
      Concentration check (DC 15 + the spell’s level) or lose the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--exhausted">Exhausted:</strong> An exhausted character moves at half speed and takes a –6
      penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A
      fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--fascinated">Fascinated:</strong> A fascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or
      spell effect. The creature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the
      fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. It takes a –4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such
      as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated
      creature a new saving throw against the fascinating effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon,
      casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect. A
      fascinated creature’s ally may shake it free of the spell as a standard action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--fatigued">Fatigued:</strong> A fatigued character can neither run nor charge and takes a
      –2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued
      character to become exhausted. After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--flat-footed">Flat-Footed:</strong> A character who has not yet acted during a combat is
      flat-footed, not yet reacting normally to the situation. A flat-footed character loses his Dexterity bonus to AC
      (if any) and cannot make attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--frightened">Frightened:</strong> A frightened creature flees from the source of its fear
      as best it can. If unable to flee, it may fight. A frightened creature takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls,
      saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. A frightened creature can use special abilities, including
      spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frightened is like shaken, except that the creature must flee if possible. Panicked is a more extreme state of
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--grappling">Grappling:</strong> Engaged in wrestling or some other form of hand-to-hand
      struggle with one or more attackers. A grappling character can undertake only a limited number of actions. He does
      not threaten any squares, and loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) against opponents he isn’t grappling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--helpless">Helpless:</strong> A helpless character is paralyzed, <i>held</i>, bound,
      sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise completely at an opponent’s mercy. A helpless target is treated as having a
      Dexterity of 0 (–5 modifier). Melee attacks against a helpless target get a +4 bonus (equivalent to attacking a
      prone target). Ranged attacks gets no special bonus against helpless targets. Rogues can sneak attack helpless
      targets.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a full-round action, an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe. An enemy can
      also use a bow or crossbow, provided he is adjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and scores a
      critical hit. (A rogue also gets her sneak attack damage bonus against a helpless foe when delivering a coup de
      grace.) If the defender survives, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die.
    </p>
    <p>Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
    <p>
      Creatures that are immune to critical hits do not take critical damage, nor do they need to make Fortitude saves
      to avoid being killed by a coup de grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--incorporeal">Incorporeal:</strong> Having no physical body. Incorporeal creatures are
      immune to all nonmagical attack forms. They can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic
      weapons, spells, spell-like effects, or supernatural effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--invisible">Invisible:</strong> Visually undetectable. An invisible creature gains a +2
      bonus on attack rolls against sighted opponents, and ignores its opponents’ Dexterity bonuses to AC (if any). (See
      Invisibility, under Special Abilities.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--knocked-down">Knocked Down:</strong> Depending on their size, creatures can be knocked
      down by winds of high velocity. Creatures on the ground are knocked prone by the force of the wind. Flying
      creatures are instead blown back 1d6 x 10 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--nauseated">Nauseated:</strong> Experiencing stomach distress. Nauseated creatures are
      unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action
      such a character can take is a single move action per turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--panicked">Panicked:</strong> A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at
      top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can’t
      take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a –2 penalty on all saving throws, skill checks, and
      ability checks. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers and does not attack, typically using the total defense
      action in combat. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature
      must use such means if they are the only way to escape.
    </p>
    <p>Panicked is a more extreme state of fear than shaken or frightened.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--paralyzed">Paralyzed:</strong> A paralyzed character is frozen in place and unable to move
      or act. A paralyzed character has effective Dexterity and Strength scores of 0 and is helpless, but can take
      purely mental actions. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its
      wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown. A creature can move through a space occupied by a
      paralyzed creature—ally or not. Each square occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2 squares.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--petrified">Petrified:</strong> A petrified character has been turned to stone and is
      considered unconscious. If a petrified character cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body
      as he returns to flesh, he is unharmed. If the character’s petrified body is incomplete when it returns to flesh,
      the body is likewise incomplete and there is some amount of permanent hit point loss and/or debilitation.
    </p>
    <p><strong id="conditions--pinned">Pinned:</strong> Held immobile (but not helpless) in a grapple.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--prone">Prone:</strong> The character is on the ground. An attacker who is prone has a –4
      penalty on melee attack rolls and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). A defender who is prone
      gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks, but takes a –4 penalty to AC against melee attacks.
    </p>
    <p>Standing up is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--shaken">Shaken:</strong> A shaken character takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving
      throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
    </p>
    <p>Shaken is a less severe state of fear than frightened or panicked.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--sickened">Sickened:</strong> The character takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon
      damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--stable">Stable:</strong> A character who was dying but who has stopped losing hit points
      and still has negative hit points is stable. The character is no longer dying, but is still unconscious. If the
      character has become stable because of aid from another character (such as a Heal check or magical healing), then
      the character no longer loses hit points. He has a 10% chance each hour of becoming conscious and disabled (even
      though his hit points are still negative).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the character became stable on his own and hasn’t had help, he is still at risk of losing hit points. Each
      hour, he has a 10% chance of becoming conscious and disabled. Otherwise he loses 1 hit point.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="conditions--staggered">Staggered:</strong> A character whose nonlethal damage exactly equals his
      current hit points is staggered. A staggered character may take a single move action or standard action each round
      (but not both, nor can she take full-round actions).
    </p>
    <p>
      A character whose current hit points exceed his nonlethal damage is no longer staggered; a character whose
      nonlethal damage exceeds his hit points becomes unconscious.
    </p>
