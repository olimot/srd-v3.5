    <h1>TYPES, SUBTYPES, &amp; SPECIAL ABILITIES</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Aberration Type:</strong> An aberration has a bizarre anatomy, strange abilities, an alien mindset, or any
      combination of the three.
    </p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> An aberration has the following features.</p>
    <p>—d8 Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p>
    <p>—Good Will saves.</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die.
    </p>
    <p><em>Traits:</em> An aberration possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with its natural weapons. If generally humanoid in form, proficient with all simple weapons and any
      weapon it is described as using.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all
      lighter types. Aberrations not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Aberrations are
      proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
    </p>
    <p>—Aberrations eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Score Loss (Su):</strong> Some attacks reduce the opponent’s score in one or more abilities. This
      loss can be temporary (ability damage) or permanent (ability drain).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Ability Damage:</em> This attack damages an opponent’s ability score. The creature’s descriptive text gives
      the ability and the amount of damage. If an attack that causes ability damage scores a critical hit, it deals
      twice the indicated amount of damage (if the damage is expressed as a die range, roll two dice). Ability damage
      returns at the rate of 1 point per day for each affected ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Ability Drain:</em> This effect permanently reduces a living opponent’s ability score when the creature hits
      with a melee attack. The creature’s descriptive text gives the ability and the amount drained. If an attack that
      causes ability drain scores a critical hit, it drains twice the indicated amount (if the damage is expressed as a
      die range, roll two dice). Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s description, a draining creature gains 5
      temporary hit points (10 on a critical hit) whenever it drains an ability score no matter how many points it
      drains. Temporary hit points gained in this fashion last for a maximum of 1 hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ability drain attacks allow a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s racial HD + draining creature’s
      Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). If no saving throw is mentioned, none is
      allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Alternate Form (Su):</strong> A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume one or more
      specific alternate forms. This ability works much like the <i>polymorph</i> spell, except that the creature is
      limited to the forms specified, and does not regain any hit points for changing its form. Assuming an alternate
      form results in the following changes to the creature:
    </p>
    <p>—The creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size of its new form.</p>
    <p>
      —The creature loses the natural weapons, natural armor, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its
      original form.
    </p>
    <p>
      —The creature gains the natural weapons, natural armor, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its
      new form.
    </p>
    <p>
      —The creature retains the special qualities of its original form. It does not gain any special qualities of its
      new form.
    </p>
    <p>
      —The creature retains the spell-like abilities and supernatural attacks of its old form (except for breath weapons
      and gaze attacks). It does not gain the spell-like abilities or supernatural attacks of its new form.
    </p>
    <p>
      —The creature gains the physical ability scores (Str, Dex, Con) of its new form. It retains the mental ability
      scores (Int, Wis, Cha) of its original form.
    </p>
    <p>
      —The creature retains its hit points and save bonuses, although its save modifiers may change due to a change in
      ability scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      —The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although it must be able to speak
      intelligibly to cast spells with verbal components and it must have humanlike hands to cast spells with somatic
      components.
    </p>
    <p>
      —The creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and it gains a +10 bonus on Disguise
      checks if it uses this ability to create a disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Air Subtype:</strong> This subtype usually is used for elementals and outsiders with a connection to the
      Elemental Plane Air. Air creatures always have fly speeds and usually have perfect maneuverability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Angel Subtype:</strong> Angels are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to the good-aligned
      Outer Planes.
    </p>
    <p><em>Traits:</em> An angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.</p>
    <p>—Immunity to acid, cold, and petrification.</p>
    <p>—Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.</p>
    <p>— +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.</p>
    <p>
      —Protective Aura (Su): Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4
      deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the angel.
      Otherwise, it functions as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect and a
      <i>lesser globe of invulnerability,</i> both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals angel’s HD). (The
      defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel’s statistics block.)
    </p>
    <p>
      —Tongues (Su): All angels can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <i>tongues</i> spell
      (caster level equal to angel’s Hit Dice). This ability is always active.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Animal Type:</strong> An animal is a living, nonhuman creature, usually a vertebrate with no magical
      abilities and no innate capacity for language or culture.
    </p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> An animal has the following features (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>—d8 Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p>
    <p>—Good Fortitude and Reflex saves (certain animals have different good saves).</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die.
    </p>
    <p><em>Traits:</em> An animal possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>—Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher can be an animal).</p>
    <p>—Low-light vision.</p>
    <p>—Alignment: Always neutral.</p>
    <p>—Treasure: None.</p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with its natural weapons only. A noncombative herbivore uses its natural weapons as a secondary
      attack. Such attacks are made with a –5 penalty on the creature’s attack rolls, and the animal receives only 1/2
      its Strength modifier as a damage adjustment.
    </p>
    <p>—Proficient with no armor unless trained for war.</p>
    <p>—Animals eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Aquatic Subtype:</strong> These creatures always have swim speeds and thus can move in water without
      making Swim checks. An aquatic creature can breathe underwater. It cannot also breathe air unless it has the
      amphibious special quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Archon Subtype:</strong> Archons are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to lawful
      good-aligned Outer Planes.
    </p>
    <p><em>Traits:</em> An archon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.</p>
    <p>
      —Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a
      20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type of
      archon, is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a –2 penalty on attacks, AC, and
      saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted
      or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon’s aura for 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p>—Immunity to electricity and petrification.</p>
    <p>— +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.</p>
    <p>
      —Magic Circle against Evil (Su): A magic circle against evil effect always surrounds an archon (caster level
      equals the archon’s Hit Dice). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an archon’s statistics
      block.)
    </p>
    <p>
      —Teleport (Su): Archons can use greater teleport at will, as the spell (caster level 14th), except that the
      creature can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Tongues (Su): All archons can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <i>tongues</i> spell
      (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Augmented Subtype:</strong> A creature receives this subtype whenever something happens to change its
      original type. Some creatures (those with an inherited template) are born with this subtype; others acquire it
      when they take on an acquired template. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature’s original type.
      A creature with the augmented subtype usually has the traits of its current type, but the features of its original
      type.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Blindsense (Ex):</strong> Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell or hearing, a creature with
      blindsense notices things it cannot see. The creature usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to
      pinpoint the location of a creature within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to
      that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see still has total concealment against the creature with
      blindsense, and the creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment.
      Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied
      its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Blindsight (Ex):</strong> This ability is similar to blindsense, but is far more discerning. Using
      nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or echolocation, a creature with
      blindsight maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature. Invisibility, darkness, and most kinds of
      concealment are irrelevant, though the creature must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that
      creature or object. The ability’s range is specified in the creature’s descriptive text. The creature usually does
      not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability. Unless noted
      otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight,
      however, must be triggered as a free action. If so, this is noted in the creature’s description. If a creature
      must trigger its blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits of blindsight only during its turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Breath Weapon (Su):</strong> A breath weapon attack usually deals damage and is often based on some type
      of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such breath weapons allow a Reflex save for half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 breathing creature’s racial HD + breathing
      creature’s Con modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). A creature is immune to its
      own breath weapon unless otherwise noted. Some breath weapons allow a Fortitude save or a Will save instead of a
      Reflex save.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Change Shape (Su):</strong> A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume the appearance
      of a specific creature or type of creature (usually a humanoid), but retains most of its own physical qualities. A
      creature cannot change shape to a form more than one size category smaller or larger than its original form.
      Changing shape results in the following changes to the creature:
    </p>
    <p>—The creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size of its new form.</p>
    <p>
      —The creature loses the natural weapons, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its original form.
    </p>
    <p>—The creature gains the natural weapons, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its new form.</p>
    <p>
      —The creature retains all other special attacks and qualities of its original form, except for breath weapons and
      gaze attacks.
    </p>
    <p>—The creature retains the ability scores of its original form.</p>
    <p>—The creature retains its hit points and saves.</p>
    <p>
      —The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although it must be able to speak
      intelligibly to cast spells with verbal components and it must have humanlike hands to cast spells with somatic
      components.
    </p>
    <p>
      —The creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks
      if it uses this ability to create a disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Chaotic Subtype:</strong> A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the chaotic-aligned Outer
      Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have chaotic alignments; however, if their alignments change
      they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the
      creature has a chaotic alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects
      according to its actual alignment. A creature with the chaotic subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its
      natural weapons and any weapons it wields were chaotic-aligned (see Damage Reduction, below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cold Subtype:</strong> A creature with the cold subtype has immunity to cold. It has vulnerability to
      fire, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving
      throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Constrict (Ex):</strong> A creature with this special attack can crush an opponent, dealing bludgeoning
      damage, after making a successful grapple check. The amount of damage is given in the creature’s entry. If the
      creature also has the improved grab ability it deals constriction damage in addition to damage dealt by the weapon
      used to grab.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Construct Type:</strong> A construct is an animated object or artificially constructed creature.</p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> A construct has the following features.</p>
    <p>—10-sided Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p>
    <p>—No good saving throws.</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die, if the construct has an Intelligence score. However, most constructs are mindless and gain no skill points or
      feats.
    </p>
    <p><em>Traits:</em> A construct possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>—No Constitution score.</p>
    <p>—Low-light vision.</p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>—Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).</p>
    <p>—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease , death effects, and necromancy effects.</p>
    <p>
      —Cannot heal damage on their own, but often can be repaired by exposing them to a certain kind of effect (see the
      creature’s description for details) or through the use of the Craft Construct feat. A construct with the fast
      healing special quality still benefits from that quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy
      drain.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless).
    </p>
    <p>—Not at risk of death from massive damage. Immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less.</p>
    <p>—Since it was never alive, a construct cannot be raised or resurrected.</p>
    <p>
      —Because its body is a mass of unliving matter, a construct is hard to destroy. It gains bonus hit points based on
      size, as shown on the following table.
    </p>
    <table data-debug="no-caption" class="half-width-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>

    <p>
      —Proficient with its natural weapons only, unless generally humanoid in form, in which case proficient with any
      weapon mentioned in its entry.
    </p>
    <p>—Proficient with no armor.</p>
    <p>—Constructs do not eat, sleep, or breathe.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Damage Reduction (Ex or Su):</strong> A creature with this special quality ignores damage from most
      weapons and natural attacks. Wounds heal immediately, or the weapon bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the
      opponent knows the attack was ineffective). The creature takes normal damage from energy attacks (even nonmagical
      ones), spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A certain kind of weapon can sometimes damage the
      creature normally, as noted below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entry indicates the amount of damage ignored (usually 5 to 15 points) and the type of weapon that negates the
      ability.
    </p>
    <p>Some monsters are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage.</p>
    <p>
      Some monsters are vulnerable to certain materials, such as alchemical silver, adamantine, or cold-forged iron.
      Attacks from weapons that are not made of the correct material have their damage reduced, even if the weapon has
      an enhancement bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some monsters are vulnerable to magic weapons. Any weapon with at least a +1 magical enhancement bonus on attack
      and damage rolls overcomes the damage reduction of these monsters. Such creatures’ natural weapons (but not their
      attacks with weapons) are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few very powerful monsters are vulnerable only to epic weapons; that is, magic weapons with at least a +6
      enhancement bonus. Such creatures’ natural weapons are also treated as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming
      damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some monsters are vulnerable to chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned weapons. When a cleric casts
      <i>align weapon,</i> affected weapons might gain one or more of these properties, and certain magic weapons have
      these properties as well. A creature with an alignment subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) can overcome this
      type of damage reduction with its natural weapons and weapons it wields as if the weapons or natural weapons had
      an alignment (or alignments) that match the subtype(s) of the creature.
    </p>
    <p>When a damage reduction entry has a dash (–) after the slash, no weapon negates the damage reduction.</p>
    <p>
      A few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of weapon. A weapon of either type overcomes this damage
      reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few other creatures require combinations of different types of attacks to overcome their damage reduction. A
      weapon must be both types to overcome this damage reduction. A weapon that is only one type is still subject to
      damage reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Dragon Type:</strong> A dragon is a reptilelike creature, usually winged, with magical or unusual
      abilities.
    </p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> A dragon has the following features.</p>
    <p>—12-sided Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as fighter).</p>
    <p>—Good Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves.</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Traits:</em> A dragon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in the description of a
      particular kind).
    </p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.</p>
    <p>—Immunity to magic sleep effects and paralysis effects.</p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with its natural weapons only unless humanoid in form (or capable of assuming humanoid form), in which
      case proficient with all simple weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.
    </p>
    <p>—Proficient with no armor.</p>
    <p>—Dragons eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Earth Subtype:</strong> This subtype usually is used for elementals and outsiders with a connection to the
      Elemental Plane of Earth. Earth creatures usually have burrow speeds, and most earth creatures can burrow through
      solid rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Elemental Type:</strong> An elemental is a being composed of one of the four classical elements: air,
      earth, fire, or water.
    </p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> An elemental has the following features.</p>
    <p>—8-sided Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p>
    <p>—Good saves depend on the element: Fortitude (earth, water) or Reflex (air, fire).</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die.
    </p>
    <p><em>Traits:</em> An elemental possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, and stunning.</p>
    <p>—Not subject to critical hits or flanking.</p>
    <p>
      —Unlike most other living creatures, an elemental does not have a dual nature—its soul and body form one unit.
      When an elemental is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their bodies, such as
      <i>raise dead, reincarnate,</i> and <i>resurrection,</i> don’t work on an elemental. It takes a different magical
      effect, such as <i>limited wish, wish, miracle,</i> or <i>true resurrection,</i> to restore it to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with natural weapons only, unless generally humanoid in form, in which case proficient with all simple
      weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) that it is described as wearing, as well as all
      lighter types. Elementals not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Elementals are proficient
      with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
    </p>
    <p>—Elementals do not eat, sleep, or breathe.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Energy Drain (Su):</strong> This attack saps a living opponent’s vital energy and happens automatically
      when a melee or ranged attack hits. Each successful energy drain bestows one or more negative levels (the
      creature’s description specifies how many). If an attack that includes an energy drain scores a critical hit, it
      drains twice the given amount. Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s description, a draining creature gains
      5 temporary hit points (10 on a critical hit) for each negative level it bestows on an opponent. These temporary
      hit points last for a maximum of 1 hour. An affected opponent takes a –1 penalty on all skill checks and ability
      checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and loses one effective level or Hit Die (whenever level is used in a die
      roll or calculation) for each negative level. A spellcaster loses one spell slot of the highest level of spells
      she can cast and (if applicable) one prepared spell of that level; this loss persists until the negative level is
      removed. Negative levels remain until 24 hours have passed or until they are removed with a spell, such as
      <i>restoration</i>. If a negative level is not removed before 24 hours have passed, the affected creature must
      attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s racial HD + draining creature’s Cha modifier; the exact
      DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). On a success, the negative level goes away with no harm to the
      creature. On a failure, the negative level goes away, but the creature’s level is also reduced by one. A separate
      saving throw is required for each negative level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Evil Subtype:</strong> A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the evil-aligned Outer
      Planes. Evil outsiders are also called fiends. Most creatures that have this subtype also have evil alignments;
      however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a
      creature with this subtype as if the creature has an evil alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The
      creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the evil subtype overcomes damage
      reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were evil-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Extraplanar Subtype:</strong> A subtype applied to any creature when it is on a plane other than its
      native plane. A creature that travels the planes can gain or lose this subtype as it goes from plane to plane.
      Monster entries assume that encounters with creatures take place on the Material Plane, and every creature whose
      native plane is not the Material Plane has the extraplanar subtype (but would not have when on its home plane).
      Every extraplanar creature in this book has a home plane mentioned in its description. Creatures not labeled as
      extraplanar are natives of the Material Plane, and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave the Material
      Plane. No creature has the extraplanar subtype when it is on a transitive plane, such as the Astral Plane, the
      Ethereal Plane, and the Plane of Shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fast Healing (Ex):</strong> A creature with the fast healing special quality regains hit points at an
      exceptionally fast rate, usually 1 or more hit points per round, as given in the creature’s entry. Except where
      noted here, fast healing is just like natural healing. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from
      starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow a creature to regrow lost body parts. Unless otherwise
      stated, it does not allow lost body parts to be reattached.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Fear (Su or Sp):</strong> Fear attacks can have various effects.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Fear Aura (Su):</em> The use of this ability is a free action. The aura can freeze an opponent (such as a
      mummy’s despair) or function like the <i>fear</i> spell. Other effects are possible. A fear aura is an area
      effect. The descriptive text gives the size and kind of area.
    </p>
    <p><em>Fear Cones (Sp) and Rays (Su):</em> These effects usually work like the <i>fear</i> spell.</p>
    <p>
      If a fear effect allows a saving throw, it is a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 fearsome creature’s racial HD + creature’s
      Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). All fear attacks are mind-affecting fear
      effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fey Type:</strong> A fey is a creature with supernatural abilities and connections to nature or to some
      other force or place. Fey are usually human-shaped.
    </p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> A fey has the following features.</p>
    <p>—6-sided Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to 1/2 total Hit Dice (as wizard).</p>
    <p>—Good Reflex and Will saves.</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die.
    </p>
    <p><em>Traits:</em> A fey possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>—Low-light vision.</p>
    <p>—Proficient with all simple weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.</p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) that it is described as wearing, as well as all
      lighter types. Fey not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Fey are proficient with shields
      if they are proficient with any form of armor.
    </p>
    <p>—Fey eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fire Subtype:</strong> A creature with the fire subtype has immunity to fire. It has vulnerability to
      cold, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a saving
      throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Flight (Ex or Su):</strong> A creature with this ability can cease or resume flight as a free action. If
      the ability is supernatural, it becomes ineffective in an antimagic field, and the creature loses its ability to
      fly for as long as the antimagic effect persists.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Frightful Presence (Ex):</strong> This special quality makes a creature’s very presence unsettling to
      foes. It takes effect automatically when the creature performs some sort of dramatic action (such as charging,
      attacking, or snarling). Opponents within range who witness the action may become frightened or shaken. Actions
      required to trigger the ability are given in the creature’s descriptive text. The range is usually 30 feet, and
      the duration is usually 5d6 rounds. This ability affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the
      creature has. An affected opponent can resist the effects with a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 frightful
      creature’s racial HD + frightful creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive
      text). An opponent that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to that same creature’s frightful presence for 24
      hours. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Gaze (Su):</strong> A gaze special attack takes effect when opponents look at the creature’s eyes. The
      attack can have almost any sort of effect: petrification, death, charm, and so on. The typical range is 30 feet,
      but check the creature’s entry for details. The type of saving throw for a gaze attack varies, but it is usually a
      Will or Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 gazing creature’s racial HD + gazing creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is
      given in the creature’s descriptive text). A successful saving throw negates the effect. A monster’s gaze attack
      is described in abbreviated form in its description. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt a
      saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn in the initiative order. Only looking directly at a
      creature with a gaze attack leaves an opponent vulnerable. Opponents can avoid the need to make the saving throw
      by not looking at the creature, in one of two ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Averting Eyes:</em> The opponent avoids looking at the creature’s face, instead looking at its body, watching
      its shadow, tracking it in a reflective surface, and so on. Each round, the opponent has a 50% chance to not need
      to make a saving throw against the gaze attack. The creature with the gaze attack, however, gains concealment
      against that opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Wearing a Blindfold:</em> The opponent cannot see the creature at all (also possible to achieve by turning
      one’s back on the creature or shutting one’s eyes). The creature with the gaze attack gains total concealment
      against the opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an attack action by choosing a target within range. That
      opponent must attempt a saving throw but can try to avoid this as described above. Thus, it is possible for an
      opponent to save against a creature’s gaze twice during the same round, once before the opponent’s action and once
      during the creature’s turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaze attacks can affect ethereal opponents. A creature is immune to gaze attacks of others of its kind unless
      otherwise noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allies of a creature with a gaze attack might be affected. All the creature’s allies are considered to be averting
      their eyes from the creature with the gaze attack, and have a 50% chance to not need to make a saving throw
      against the gaze attack each round. The creature also can veil its eyes, thus negating its gaze ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Giant Type:</strong> A giant is a humanoid-shaped creature of great strength, usually of at least Large
      size.
    </p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> A giant has the following features.</p>
    <p>—8-sided Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p>
    <p>—Good Fortitude saves.</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die.
    </p>
    <p><em>Traits:</em> A giant possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>—Low-light vision.</p>
    <p>—Proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as any natural weapons.</p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all
      lighter types. Giants not described as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Giants are proficient with
      shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
    </p>
    <p>—Giants eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Goblinoid Subtype:</strong> Goblinoids are stealthy humanoids who live by hunting and raiding and who all
      speak Goblin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Good Subtype:</strong> A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the good-aligned Outer
      Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have good alignments; however, if their alignments change, they
      still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the
      creature has a good alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects
      according to its actual alignment. A creature with the good subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural
      weapons and any weapons it wields were good-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Humanoid Type:</strong> A humanoid usually has two arms, two legs, and one head, or a humanlike torso,
      arms, and a head. Humanoids have few or no supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but most can speak and usually
      have well-developed societies. They usually are Small or Medium. Every humanoid creature also has a subtype.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humanoids with 1 Hit Die exchange the features of their humanoid Hit Die for the class features of a PC or NPC
      class. Humanoids of this sort are presented as 1st-level warriors, which means that they have average combat
      ability and poor saving throws.
    </p>
    <p>Humanoids with more than 1 Hit Die are the only humanoids who make use of the features of the humanoid type.</p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> A humanoid has the following features (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>—8-sided Hit Dice, or by character class.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p>
    <p>—Good Reflex saves (usually; a humanoid’s good save varies).</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die, or by character class.
    </p>
    <p><em>Traits:</em> A humanoid possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>—Proficient with all simple weapons, or by character class.</p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, or by character
      class. If a humanoid does not have a class and wears armor, it is proficient with that type of armor and all
      lighter types. Humanoids not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Humanoids are proficient
      with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
    </p>
    <p>—Humanoids breathe, eat, and sleep.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved Grab (Ex):</strong> If a creature with this special attack hits with a melee weapon (usually a
      claw or bite attack), it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an
      attack of opportunity. No initial touch attack is required. Unless otherwise noted, improved grab works only
      against opponents at least one size category smaller than the creature. The creature has the option to conduct the
      grapple normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the improved grab to hold the opponent. If it
      chooses to do the latter, it takes a –20 penalty on grapple checks, but is not considered grappled itself; the
      creature does not lose its Dexterity bonus to AC, still threatens an area, and can use its remaining attacks
      against other opponents. A successful hold does not deal any extra damage unless the creature also has the
      constrict special attack. If the creature does not constrict, each successful grapple check it makes during
      successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, it
      deals constriction damage as well (the amount is given in the creature’s descriptive text). When a creature gets a
      hold after an improved grab attack, it pulls the opponent into its space. This act does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity. It can even move (possibly carrying away the opponent), provided it can drag the opponent’s weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Incorporeal Subtype:</strong> An incorporeal creature has no physical body. It can be harmed only by other
      incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities,
      or supernatural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons,
      it has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy,
      force effects such as <i>magic missile,</i> or attacks made with <i>ghost touch</i> weapons). Although it is not a
      magical attack, holy water can affect incorporeal undead, but a hit with holy water has a 50% chance of not
      affecting an incorporeal creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus but has a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus (always
      at least +1, even if the creature’s Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus).
    </p>
    <p>
      An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects, but must remain adjacent to the object’s
      exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than its own. It can sense the
      presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to its current location, but enemies have total
      concealment (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature that is inside an object. In order to see farther from
      the object it is in and attack normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature inside an
      object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature outside the object it only has cover, so a creature outside
      with a readied action could strike at it as it attacks. An incorporeal creature cannot pass through a force
      effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      An incorporeal creature’s attacks pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection
      bonuses and force effects (such as
      <i>mage armor</i>) work normally against it. Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as
      they do in air. Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take falling damage. Incorporeal creatures cannot make trip
      or grapple attacks, nor can they be tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physical action that would
      move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are they subject to such actions. Incorporeal creatures have
      no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn’t wish to be. It has no
      Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attacks and its ranged attacks. Nonvisual
      senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal
      creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when they
      cannot see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Lawful:</strong> A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the lawful-aligned Outer Planes.
      Most creatures that have this subtype also have lawful alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still
      retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature
      has a lawful alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to
      its actual alignment. A creature with the lawful subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and
      any weapons it wields were lawful-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Low-Light Vision (Ex):</strong> A creature with low-light vision can see twice as far as a human in
      starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of shadowy illumination. It retains the ability to
      distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Magical Beast Type:</strong> Magical beasts are similar to animals but can have Intelligence scores higher
      than 2. Magical beasts usually have supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but sometimes are merely bizarre in
      appearance or habits.
    </p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> A magical beast has the following features.</p>
    <p>—10-sided Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as fighter).</p>
    <p>—Good Fortitude and Reflex saves.</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Traits:</em> A magical beast possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
    </p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.</p>
    <p>—Proficient with its natural weapons only.</p>
    <p>—Proficient with no armor.</p>
    <p>—Magical beasts eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Manufactured Weapons:</strong> Some monsters employ manufactured weapons when they attack. Creatures that
      use swords, bows, spears, and the like follow the same rules as characters, including those for additional attacks
      from a high base attack bonus and two-weapon fighting penalties. This category also includes “found items,” such
      as rocks and logs, that a creature wields in combat— in essence, any weapon that is not intrinsic to the creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some creatures combine attacks with natural and manufactured weapons when they make a full attack. When they do
      so, the manufactured weapon attack is considered the primary attack unless the creature’s description indicates
      otherwise and any natural weapons the creature also uses are considered secondary natural attacks. These secondary
      attacks do not interfere with the primary attack as attacking with an off-hand weapon does, but they take the
      usual –5 penalty (or –2 with the Multiattack feat) for such attacks, even if the natural weapon used is normally
      the creature’s primary natural weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Monstrous Humanoid Type:</strong> Monstrous humanoids are similar to humanoids, but with monstrous or
      animalistic features. They often have magical abilities as well.
    </p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> A monstrous humanoid has the following features.</p>
    <p>—8-sided Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as fighter).</p>
    <p>—Good Reflex and Will saves.</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Traits:</em> A monstrous humanoid possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s
      entry).
    </p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>—Proficient with all simple weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.</p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all
      lighter types. Monstrous humanoids not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Monstrous
      humanoids are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
    </p>
    <p>—Monstrous humanoids eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Movement Modes:</strong> Creatures may have modes of movement other than walking and running. These are
      natural, not magical, unless specifically noted in a monster description.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Burrow:</em> A creature with a burrow speed can tunnel through dirt, but not through rock unless the
      descriptive text says otherwise. Creatures cannot charge or run while burrowing. Most burrowing creatures do not
      leave behind tunnels other creatures can use (either because the material they tunnel through fills in behind them
      or because they do not actually dislocate any material when burrowing); see the individual creature descriptions
      for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Climb:</em> A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The creature must make a
      Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more than 0, but it always can choose to take 10 even if
      rushed or threatened while climbing. The creature climbs at the given speed while climbing. If it chooses an
      accelerated climb it moves at double the given climb speed (or its base land speed, whichever is lower) and makes
      a single Climb check at a –5 penalty. Creatures cannot run while climbing. A creature retains its Dexterity bonus
      to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their attacks against a climbing
      creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Fly:</em> A creature with a fly speed can move through the air at the indicated speed if carrying no more than
      a light load. (Note that medium armor does not necessarily constitute a medium load.) All fly speeds include a
      parenthetical note indicating maneuverability, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      —Perfect: The creature can perform almost any aerial maneuver it wishes. It moves through the air as well as a
      human moves over smooth ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Good: The creature is very agile in the air (like a housefly or a hummingbird), but cannot change direction as
      readily as those with perfect maneuverability.
    </p>
    <p>—Average: The creature can fly as adroitly as a small bird.</p>
    <p>—Poor: The creature flies as well as a very large bird.</p>
    <p>—Clumsy: The creature can barely maneuver at all.</p>
    <p>
      A creature that flies can make dive attacks. A dive attack works just like a charge, but the diving creature must
      move a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. It can make only claw or talon attacks, but these deal
      double damage. A creature can use the run action while flying, provided it flies in a straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Swim:</em> A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its swim speed without making Swim checks.
      It has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. The creature can
      always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. The creature can use the run
      action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Native Subtype:</strong> A subtype applied only to outsiders. These creatures have mortal ancestors or a
      strong connection to the Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living
      creatures can be. Creatures with this subtype are native to the Material Plane (hence the subtype’s name). Unlike
      true outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Natural Weapons:</strong> Natural weapons are weapons that are physically a part of a creature. A creature
      making a melee attack with a natural weapon is considered armed and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
      Likewise, it threatens any space it can reach. Creatures do not receive additional attacks from a high base attack
      bonus when using natural weapons. The number of attacks a creature can make with its natural weapons depends on
      the type of the attack—generally, a creature can make one bite attack, one attack per claw or tentacle, one gore
      attack, one sting attack, or one slam attack (although Large creatures with arms or arm-like limbs can make a slam
      attack with each arm). Refer to the individual monster descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>Unless otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 20.</p>
    <p>
      When a creature has more than one natural weapon, one of them (or sometimes a pair or set of them) is the primary
      weapon. All the creature’s remaining natural weapons are secondary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary weapon is given in the creature’s Attack entry, and the primary weapon or weapons is given first in
      the creature’s Full Attack entry. A creature’s primary natural weapon is its most effective natural attack,
      usually by virtue of the creature’s physiology, training, or innate talent with the weapon. An attack with a
      primary natural weapon uses the creature’s full attack bonus. Attacks with secondary natural weapons are less
      effective and are made with a –5 penalty on the attack roll, no matter how many there are. (Creatures with the
      Multiattack feat take only a –2 penalty on secondary attacks.) This penalty applies even when the creature makes a
      single attack with the secondary weapon as part of the attack action or as an attack of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do. The most common are summarized below.</p>
    <p><em>Bite:</em> The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage.</p>
    <p><em>Claw or Talon:</em> The creature rips with a sharp appendage, dealing piercing and slashing damage.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Gore:</em> The creature spears the opponent with an antler, horn, or similar appendage, dealing piercing
      damage.
    </p>
    <p><em>Slap or Slam:</em> The creature batters opponents with an appendage, dealing bludgeoning damage.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Sting:</em> The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing damage. Sting attacks usually deal damage from
      poison in addition to hit point damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Tentacle:</em> The creature flails at opponents with a powerful tentacle, dealing bludgeoning (and sometimes
      slashing) damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nonabilities:</strong> Some creatures lack certain ability scores. These creatures do not have an ability
      score of 0—they lack the ability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0. Other effects of nonabilities
      are detailed below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Strength:</em> Any creature that can physically manipulate other objects has at least 1 point of Strength. A
      creature with no Strength score can’t exert force, usually because it has no physical body or because it doesn’t
      move. The creature automatically fails Strength checks. If the creature can attack, it applies its Dexterity
      modifier to its base attack bonus instead of a Strength modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Dexterity:</em> Any creature that can move has at least 1 point of Dexterity. A creature with no Dexterity
      score can’t move. If it can perform actions (such as casting spells), it applies its Intelligence modifier to
      initiative checks instead of a Dexterity modifier. The creature automatically fails Reflex saves and Dexterity
      checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Constitution:</em> Any living creature has at least 1 point of Constitution. A creature with no Constitution
      has no body or no metabolism. It is immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect works on
      objects or is harmless. The creature is also immune to ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain, and
      automatically fails Constitution checks. A creature with no Constitution cannot tire and thus can run indefinitely
      without tiring (unless the creature’s description says it cannot run).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Intelligence:</em> Any creature that can think, learn, or remember has at least 1 point of Intelligence. A
      creature with no Intelligence score is mindless, an automaton operating on simple instincts or programmed
      instructions. It has immunity to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale
      effects) and automatically fails Intelligence checks.
    </p>
    <p>Mindless creatures do not gain feats or skills, although they may have bonus feats or racial skill bonuses.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Wisdom:</em> Any creature that can perceive its environment in any fashion has at least 1 point of Wisdom.
      Anything with no Wisdom score is an object, not a creature. Anything without a Wisdom score also has no Charisma
      score.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Charisma:</em> Any creature capable of telling the difference between itself and things that are not itself
      has at least 1 point of Charisma. Anything with no Charisma score is an object, not a creature. Anything without a
      Charisma score also has no Wisdom score.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Ooze Type:</strong> An ooze is an amorphous or mutable creature, usually mindless.</p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> An ooze has the following features.</p>
    <p>—10-sided Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p>
    <p>—No good saving throws.</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die, if the ooze has an Intelligence score. However, most oozes are mindless and gain no skill points or feats.
    </p>
    <p><em>Traits:</em> An ooze possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>
      —Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
      patterns, and morale effects).
    </p>
    <p>
      —Blind (but have the blindsight special quality), with immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and
      other attack forms that rely on sight.
    </p>
    <p>—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning.</p>
    <p>
      —Some oozes have the ability to deal acid damage to objects. In such a case, the amount of damage is equal to 10 +
      1/2 ooze’s HD + ooze’s Con modifier per full round of contact.
    </p>
    <p>—Not subject to critical hits or flanking.</p>
    <p>—Proficient with its natural weapons only.</p>
    <p>—Proficient with no armor.</p>
    <p>—Oozes eat and breathe, but do not sleep.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Outsider Type:</strong> An outsider is at least partially composed of the essence (but not necessarily the
      material) of some plane other than the Material Plane. Some creatures start out as some other type and become
      outsiders when they attain a higher (or lower) state of spiritual existence.
    </p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> An outsider has the following features.</p>
    <p>—8-sided Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (as fighter).</p>
    <p>—Good Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves.</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (8 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die.
    </p>
    <p><em>Traits:</em> An outsider possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>
      —Unlike most other living creatures, an outsider does not have a dual nature—its soul and body form one unit. When
      an outsider is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their bodies, such as
      <i>raise dead, reincarnate,</i> and <i>resurrection,</i> don’t work on an outsider. It takes a different magical
      effect, such as <i>limited wish, wish, miracle,</i> or <i>true resurrection</i> to restore it to life. An outsider
      with the native subtype can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be.
    </p>
    <p>—Proficient with all simple and martial weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.</p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all
      lighter types. Outsiders not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Outsiders are proficient
      with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Outsiders breathe, but do not need to eat or sleep (although they can do so if they wish). Native outsiders
      breathe, eat, and sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Paralysis (Ex or Su):</strong> This special attack renders the victim immobile. Paralyzed creatures cannot
      move, speak, or take any physical actions. The creature is rooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. Paralysis
      works on the body, and a character can usually resist it with a Fortitude saving throw (the DC is given in the
      creature’s description). Unlike <i>hold person</i> and similar effects, a paralysis effect does not allow a new
      save each round. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and
      falls. A swimmer can’t swim and may drown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Plant Type:</strong> This type comprises vegetable creatures. Note that regular plants, such as one finds
      growing in gardens and fields, lack Wisdom and Charisma scores (see Nonabilities, above) and are not creatures,
      but objects, even though they are alive.
    </p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> A plant creature has the following features.</p>
    <p>—8-sided Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p>
    <p>—Good Fortitude saves.</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die, if the plant creature has an Intelligence score. However, some plant creatures are mindless and gain no skill
      points or feats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Traits:</em> A plant creature possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
    </p>
    <p>—Low-light vision.</p>
    <p>—Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).</p>
    <p>—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning.</p>
    <p>—Not subject to critical hits.</p>
    <p>—Proficient with its natural weapons only.</p>
    <p>—Proficient with no armor.</p>
    <p>—Plants breathe and eat, but do not sleep.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Poison (Ex):</strong> Poison attacks deal initial damage, such as ability damage (see page 305) or some
      other effect, to the opponent on a failed Fortitude save. Unless otherwise noted, another saving throw is required
      1 minute later (regardless of the first save’s result) to avoid secondary damage. A creature’s descriptive text
      provides the details.
    </p>
    <p>A creature with a poison attack is immune to its own poison and the poison of others of its kind.</p>
    <p>
      The Fortitude save DC against a poison attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 poisoning creature’s racial HD + poisoning
      creature’s Con modifier (the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text).
    </p>
    <p>A successful save avoids (negates) the damage.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Pounce (Ex):</strong> When a creature with this special attack makes a charge, it can follow with a full
      attack—including rake attacks if the creature also has the rake ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Powerful Charge (Ex):</strong> When a creature with this special attack makes a charge, its attack deals
      extra damage in addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge. The amount of damage from the attack is
      given in the creature’s description.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Psionics (Sp):</strong> These are spell-like abilities that a creature generates with the power of its
      mind. Psionic abilities are usually usable at will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rake (Ex):</strong> A creature with this special attack gains extra natural attacks when it grapples its
      foe. Normally, a monster can attack with only one of its natural weapons while grappling, but a monster with the
      rake ability usually gains two additional claw attacks that it can use only against a grappled foe. Rake attacks
      are not subject to the usual –4 penalty for attacking with a natural weapon in a grapple.
    </p>
    <p>
      A monster with the rake ability must begin its turn grappling to use its rake—it can’t begin a grapple and rake in
      the same turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ray (Su or Sp):</strong> This form of special attack works like a ranged attack. Hitting with a ray attack
      requires a successful ranged touch attack roll, ignoring armor, natural armor, and shield and using the creature’s
      ranged attack bonus. Ray attacks have no range increment. The creature’s descriptive text specifies the maximum
      range, effects, and any applicable saving throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Regeneration (Ex):</strong> A creature with this ability is difficult to kill. Damage dealt to the
      creature is treated as nonlethal damage. The creature automatically heals nonlethal damage at a fixed rate per
      round, as given in the entry. Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, deal lethal damage to the creature,
      which doesn’t go away. The creature’s descriptive text describes the details. A regenerating creature that has
      been rendered unconscious through nonlethal damage can be killed with a coup de grace. The attack cannot be of a
      type that automatically converts to nonlethal damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attack forms that don’t deal hit point damage ignore regeneration. Regeneration also does not restore hit points
      lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. Regenerating creatures can regrow lost portions of their bodies and
      can reattach severed limbs or body parts; details are in the creature’s descriptive text. Severed parts that are
      not reattached wither and die normally.
    </p>
    <p>A creature must have a Constitution score to have the regeneration ability.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Reptilian Subtype:</strong> These creatures are scaly and usually coldblooded. The reptilian subtype is
      only used to describe a set of humanoid races, not all animals and monsters that are truly reptiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Resistance to Energy (Ex):</strong> A creature with this special quality ignores some damage of the
      indicated type each time it takes damage of that kind (commonly acid, cold, fire, or electricity). The entry
      indicates the amount and type of damage ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Scent (Ex):</strong> This special quality allows a creature to detect approaching enemies, sniff out
      hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as
      humans do familiar sights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases
      to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at
      twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at
      triple normal range.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a creature detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere
      within range. The creature can take a move action to note the direction of the scent.
    </p>
    <p>Whenever the creature comes within 5 feet of the source, the creature pinpoints the source’s location.</p>
    <p>
      A creature with the Track feat and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival)
      check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the
      scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and
      the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows
      the rules for the Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor
      visibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shapechanger Subtype:</strong> A shapechanger has the supernatural ability to assume one or more alternate
      forms. Many magical effects allow some kind of shape shifting, and not every creature that can change shapes has
      the shapechanger subtype.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Traits:</em> A shapechanger possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
    </p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with its natural weapons, with simple weapons, and with any weapons mentioned in the creature’s
      description.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with any armor mentioned in the creature’s description, as well as all lighter forms. If no form of
      armor is mentioned, the shapechanger is not proficient with armor. A shapechanger is proficient with shields if it
      is proficient with any type of armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sonic Attacks (Su):</strong> Unless otherwise noted, a sonic attack follows the rules for spreads. The
      range of the spread is measured from the creature using the sonic attack. Once a sonic attack has taken effect,
      deafening the subject or stopping its ears does not end the effect. Stopping one’s ears ahead of time allows
      opponents to avoid having to make saving throws against mind-affecting sonic attacks, but not other kinds of sonic
      attacks (such as those that deal damage). Stopping one’s ears is a full-round action and requires wax or other
      soundproof material to stuff into the ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special Abilities:</strong> A special ability is either extraordinary (Ex), spell-like (Sp), or
      supernatural (Su).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Extraordinary:</em> Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical, don’t become ineffective in an
      <i>antimagic field,</i> and are not subject to any effect that disrupts magic. Using an extraordinary ability is a
      free action unless otherwise noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Spell-Like:</em> Spell-like abilities are magical and work just like spells (though they are not spells and so
      have no verbal, somatic, material, focus, or XP components). They go away in an <i>antimagic field</i> and are
      subject to spell resistance if the spell the ability resembles or duplicates would be subject to spell resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spell-like ability usually has a limit on how often it can be used. A spell-like ability that can be used at
      will has no use limit. Using a spell-like ability is a standard action unless noted otherwise, and doing so while
      threatened provokes attacks of opportunity. It is possible to make a Concentration check to use a spell-like
      ability defensively and avoid provoking an attack of opportunity, just as when casting a spell. A spell-like
      ability can be disrupted just as a spell can be. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they
      be counterspelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      For creatures with spell-like abilities, a designated caster level defines how difficult it is to dispel their
      spell-like effects and to define any level-dependent variables (such as range and duration) the abilities might
      have. The creature’s caster level never affects which spell-like abilities the creature has; sometimes the given
      caster level is lower than the level a spellcasting character would need to cast the spell of the same name. If no
      caster level is specified, the caster level is equal to the creature’s Hit Dice. The saving throw (if any) against
      a spell-like ability is 10 + the level of the spell the ability resembles or duplicates + the creature’s Cha
      modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some spell-like abilities duplicate spells that work differently when cast by characters of different classes. A
      monster’s spell-like abilities are presumed to be the sorcerer/wizard versions. If the spell in question is not a
      sorcerer/wizard spell, then default to cleric, druid, bard, paladin, and ranger, in that order.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Supernatural:</em> Supernatural abilities are magical and go away in an <i>antimagic field</i> but are not
      subject to spell resistance. Supernatural abilities cannot be dispelled. Using a supernatural ability is a
      standard action unless noted otherwise. Supernatural abilities may have a use limit or be usable at will, just
      like spell-like abilities. However, supernatural abilities do not provoke attacks of opportunity and never require
      Concentration checks. Unless otherwise noted, a supernatural ability has an effective caster level equal to the
      creature’s Hit Dice. The saving throw (if any) against a supernatural ability is 10 + 1/2 the creature’s HD + the
      creature’s ability modifier (usually Charisma).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell Immunity (Ex):</strong> A creature with spell immunity avoids the effects of spells and spell-like
      abilities that directly affect it. This works exactly like spell resistance, except that it cannot be overcome.
      Sometimes spell immunity is conditional or applies to only spells of a certain kind or level. Spells that do not
      allow spell resistance are not affected by spell immunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spell Resistance (Ex):</strong> A creature with spell resistance can avoid the effects of spells and
      spell-like abilities that directly affect it.To determine if a spell or spell-like ability works against a
      creature with spell resistance, the caster must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level). If the result
      equals or exceeds the creature’s spell resistance, the spell works normally, although the creature is still
      allowed a saving throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells:</strong> Sometimes a creature can cast arcane or divine spells just as a member of a spellcasting
      class can (and can activate magic items accordingly). Such creatures are subject to the same spellcasting rules
      that characters are, except as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spellcasting creature that lacks hands or arms can provide any somatic component a spell might require by moving
      its body. Such a creature also does need material components for its spells. The creature can cast the spell by
      either touching the required component (but not if the component is in another creature’s possession) or having
      the required component on its person. Sometimes spellcasting creatures utilize the Eschew Materials feat to avoid
      fussing with noncostly components.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spellcasting creature is not actually a member of a class unless its entry says so, and it does not gain any
      class abilities. A creature with access to cleric spells must prepare them in the normal manner and receives
      domain spells if noted, but it does not receive domain granted powers unless it has at least one level in the
      cleric class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Summon</i> (Sp):</strong> A creature with the <i>summon</i> ability can summon specific other creatures
      of its kind much as though casting a <i>summon monster</i> spell, but it usually has only a limited chance of
      success (as specified in the creature’s entry). Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons. Summoned
      creatures automatically return whence they came after 1 hour. A creature that has just been summoned cannot use
      its own summon ability for 1 hour. Most creatures with the ability to summon do not use it lightly, since it
      leaves them beholden to the summoned creature. In general, they use it only when necessary to save their own
      lives. An appropriate spell level is given for each summoning ability for purposes of Concentration checks and
      attempts to dispel the summoned creature. No experience points are awarded for summoned monsters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Swallow Whole (Ex):</strong> If a creature with this special attack begins its turn with an opponent held
      in its mouth (see Improved Grab), it can attempt a new grapple check (as though attempting to pin the opponent).
      If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent takes bite damage. Unless otherwise noted, the opponent can
      be up to one size category smaller than the swallowing creature. Being swallowed has various consequences,
      depending on the creature doing the swallowing. A swallowed creature is considered to be grappled, while the
      creature that did the swallowing is not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing
      or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is noted in the creature description), or it
      can just try to escape the grapple. The Armor Class of the interior of a creature that swallows whole is normally
      10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If the swallowed creature escapes the
      grapple, success puts it back in the attacker’s mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Swarm Subtype:</strong> A swarm is a collection of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a
      single creature. A swarm has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A swarm has a single pool of
      Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class. A swarm makes
      saving throws as a single creature. A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying creatures) or
      a cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order to
      attack, it moves into an opponent’s space, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same space
      as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can move through squares occupied by enemies
      and vice versa without impediment, although the swarm provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A swarm can
      move through cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive
      creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures consists of
      10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than
      could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed
      tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are
      represented by multiples of single swarms. The area occupied by a large swarm is completely shapeable, though the
      swarm usually remains in contiguous squares.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Traits:</em> A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical
      hits or flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm
      composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage. Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or lower
      causes it to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist
      attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled,
      or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target
      spells such as <i>disintegrate</i>), with the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
      patterns, and morale effects) if the swarm has an Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as
      much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as splash weapons and many evocation spells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds such as that created by a
      <i>gust of wind</i> spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a
      creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. A swarm rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage
      becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Swarm Attack:</em> Creatures with the swarm subtype don’t make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal
      automatic damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed.
      Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover. A swarm’s statistics block has “swarm” in
      the Attack and Full Attack entries, with no attack bonus given. The amount of damage a swarm deals is based on its
      Hit Dice, as shown below.

    <p>
      A swarm’s attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarm’s description states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient to
      reduce a swarm attack’s damage to 0, being incorporeal, and other special abilities usually give a creature
      immunity (or at least resistance) to damage from a swarm. Some swarms also have acid, poison, blood drain, or
      other special attacks in addition to normal damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swarms do not threaten creatures in their square, and do not make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack.
      However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy, as described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Distraction (Ex):</em> Any living creature vulnerable to a swarm’s damage that begins its turn with a swarm in
      its square is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 swarm’s HD + swarm’s Con modifier; the exact DC
      is given in a swarm’s description) negates the effect. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of
      a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration
      requires a DC 20 Concentration check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Telepathy (Su):</strong> A creature with this ability can communicate telepathically with any other
      creature within a certain range (specified in the creature’s entry, usually 100 feet) that has a language. It is
      possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with
      more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people
      at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>Some creatures have a limited form of telepathy, while others have a more powerful form of the ability.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Trample (Ex):</strong> As a full-round action, a creature with this special attack can move up to twice
      its speed and literally run over any opponents at least one size category smaller than itself. The creature merely
      has to move over the opponents in its path; any creature whose space is completely covered by the trampling
      creature’s space is subject to the trample attack. If a target’s space is larger than 5 feet, it is only
      considered trampled if the trampling creature moves over all the squares it occupies. If the trampling creature
      moves over only some of a target’s space, the target can make an attack of opportunity against the trampling
      creature at a –4 penalty. A trampling creature that accidentally ends its movement in an illegal space returns to
      the last legal position it occupied, or the closest legal position, if there’s a legal position that’s closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A trample attack deals bludgeoning damage (the creature’s slam damage + 1-1/2 times its Str modifier). The
      creature’s descriptive text gives the exact amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trampled opponents can attempt attacks of opportunity, but these take a –4 penalty. If they do not make attacks of
      opportunity, trampled opponents can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The save DC against a creature’s trample attack is 10 + 1/2 creature’s HD + creature’s Str modifier (the exact DC
      is given in the creature’s descriptive text). A trampling creature can only deal trampling damage to each target
      once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tremorsense (Ex):</strong> A creature with tremorsense is sensitive to vibrations in the ground and can
      automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the ground. Aquatic creatures with
      tremorsense can also sense the location of creatures moving through water. The ability’s range is specified in the
      creature’s descriptive text.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Treasure:</strong> This entry in a monster description describes how much wealth a creature owns. In most
      cases, a creature keeps valuables in its home or lair and has no treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent
      creatures that own useful, portable treasure (such as magic items) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky
      items at home. Treasure can include coins, goods, and items. Creatures can have varying amounts of each, as
      follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Standard:</em> Refer to the treasure tablesand roll d% once for each type of treasure (Coins, Goods, Items) on
      the Level section of the table that corresponds to the creature’s Challenge Rating (for groups of creatures, use
      the Encounter Level for the encounter instead). Some creatures have double, triple, or even quadruple standard
      treasure; in these cases, roll for each type of treasure two, three, or four times.
    </p>
    <p><em>None:</em> The creature collects no treasure of its own.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Nonstandard:</em> Some creatures have quirks or habits that affect the types of treasure they collect. These
      creatures use the same treasure tables, but with special adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Fractional Coins:</em> Roll on the Coins column in the section corresponding to the creature’s Challenge
      Rating, but divide the result as indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>% Goods or Items:</em> The creature has goods or items only some of the time. Before checking for goods or
      items, roll d% against the given percentage. On a success, make a normal roll on the appropriate Goods or Items
      column (which may still result in no goods or items).
    </p>
    <p><em>Double Goods or Items:</em> Roll twice on the appropriate Goods or Items column.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Parenthetical Notes:</em> Some entries for goods or items include notes that limit the types of treasure a
      creature collects.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a note includes the word “no,” it means the creature does not collect or cannot keep that thing. If a random
      roll generates such a result, treat the result as “none” instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a note includes the word “only,” the creature goes out of its way to collect treasure of the indicated type.
      Treat all results from that column as the indicated type of treasure.
    </p>
    <p>It’s sometimes necessary to reroll until the right sort of item appears.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Turn Resistance (Ex):</strong> A creature with this special quality (usually an undead) is less easily
      affected by clerics or paladins. When resolving a turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempt, add the indicated
      number to the creature’s Hit Dice total.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Undead Type:</strong> Undead are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces.</p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> An undead creature has the following features.</p>
    <p>—12-sided Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to 1/2 total Hit Dice (as wizard).</p>
    <p>—Good Will saves.</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (4 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die, if the undead creature has an Intelligence score. However, many undead are mindless and gain no skill points
      or feats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Traits:</em> An undead creature possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
    </p>
    <p>—No Constitution score.</p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>—Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).</p>
    <p>—Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, and death effects.</p>
    <p>
      —Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Immune to damage to its physical
      ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), as well as to fatigue and exhaustion effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Cannot heal damage on its own if it has no Intelligence score, although it can be healed. Negative energy (such
      as an <i>inflict</i> spell) can heal undead creatures. The fast healing special quality works regardless of the
      creature’s Intelligence score.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless).
    </p>
    <p>—Uses its Charisma modifier for Concentration checks.</p>
    <p>
      —Not at risk of death from massive damage, but when reduced to 0 hit points or less, it is immediately destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      —Not affected by <i>raise dead</i> and <i>reincarnate</i> spells or abilities. <i>Resurrection</i> and
      <i>true resurrection</i> can affect undead creatures. These spells turn undead creatures back into the living
      creatures they were before becoming undead.
    </p>
    <p>—Proficient with its natural weapons, all simple weapons, and any weapons mentioned in its entry.</p>
    <p>
      —Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all
      lighter types. Undead not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Undead are proficient with
      shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
    </p>
    <p>—Undead do not breathe, eat, or sleep.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Vermin Type:</strong> This type includes insects, arachnids, other arthropods, worms, and similar
      invertebrates.
    </p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> Vermin have the following features.</p>
    <p>—8-sided Hit Dice.</p>
    <p>—Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</p>
    <p>—Good Fortitude saves.</p>
    <p>
      —Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit
      Die, if the vermin has an Intelligence score. However, most vermin are mindless and gain no skill points or feats.
    </p>
    <p><em>Traits:</em> Vermin possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).</p>
    <p>
      —Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
      patterns, and morale effects).
    </p>
    <p>—Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
    <p>—Proficient with their natural weapons only.</p>
    <p>—Proficient with no armor.</p>
    <p>—Vermin breathe, eat, and sleep.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Vulnerability to Energy:</strong> Some creatures have vulnerability to a certain kind of energy effect
      (typically either cold or fire). Such a creature takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from the effect,
      regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Water Subtype:</strong> This subtype usually is used for elementals and outsiders with a connection to the
      Elemental Plane of Water. Creatures with the water subtype always have swim speeds and can move in water without
      making Swim checks. A water creature can breathe underwater and usually can breathe air as well.
