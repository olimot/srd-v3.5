    <h3 id="wealth-and-money--coins">Coins</h3>
    <p>
      The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces. Each silver piece is worth 10
      copper pieces (cp). In addition to copper, silver, and gold coins, there are also platinum pieces (pp), which are
      each worth 10 gp.
    </p>
    <p>The standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce (fifty to the pound).</p>

    <h3 id="wealth-and-money--selling-loot">Selling Loot</h3>
    <p>In general, a character can sell something for half its listed price.</p>
    <p>
      Trade goods are the exception to the half-price rule. A trade good, in this sense, is a valuable good that can be
      easily exchanged almost as if it were cash itself.
    </p>
    <h2 id="weapons">Weapons</h2>
    <h3 id="weapons--weapon-categories">Weapon Categories</h3>
    <p>Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories.</p>
    <p>
      These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon’s use (simple, martial, or
      exotic), the weapon’s usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both
      thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size (Small,
      Medium, or Large).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-categories--simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons"
        >Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons:</strong
      >
      Anybody but a druid, monk, rogue, or wizard is proficient with all simple weapons. Barbarians, fighters, paladins,
      and rangers are proficient with all simple and all martial weapons. Characters of other classes are proficient
      with an assortment of mainly simple weapons and possibly also some martial or even exotic weapons. A character who
      uses a weapon with which he or she is not proficient takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-categories--melee-and-ranged-weapons">Melee and Ranged Weapons:</strong> Melee weapons
      are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or
      projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="weapons--weapon-categories--melee-and-ranged-weapons--reach-weapons">Reach Weapons:</em> Glaives,
      guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, spiked chains, and whips are reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee
      weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren’t adjacent to him or her. Most reach double the
      wielder’s natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10
      feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the
      appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="weapons--weapon-categories--melee-and-ranged-weapons--double-weapons">Double Weapons:</em> Dire flails,
      dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes, quarterstaffs, and two-bladed swords are double weapons.
      A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with two weapons, but he or she incurs all
      the normal attack penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just as though the character were wielding a
      one-handed weapon and a light weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character can also choose to use a double weapon two handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature
      wielding a double weapon in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any
      given round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="weapons--weapon-categories--melee-and-ranged-weapons--thrown-weapons">Thrown Weapons:</em> Daggers, clubs,
      shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown
      weapons. The wielder applies his or her Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash
      weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that isn’t designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn’t
      have a numeric entry in the Range Increment column on Table: Weapons), but a character who does so takes a –4
      penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a
      two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on
      a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="weapons--weapon-categories--melee-and-ranged-weapons--projectile-weapons">Projectile Weapons:</em> Light
      crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, composite longbows, hand crossbows,
      and repeating crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific
      weapon descriptions). A character gets no Strength bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it’s a
      specially built composite shortbow, specially built composite longbow, or sling. If the character has a penalty
      for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when he or she uses a bow or a sling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="weapons--weapon-categories--melee-and-ranged-weapons--ammunition">Ammunition:</em> Projectile weapons use
      ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), or sling bullets (for slings). When using a bow, a character
      can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading. Generally speaking,
      ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while normal ammunition that misses has a 50%
      chance of being destroyed or lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting
      masterwork or otherwise special versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons), and what happens to them after they are
      thrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-categories--light-one-handed-and-two-handed-melee-weapons"
        >Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons:</strong
      >
      This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a
      melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon’s size category, is considered a light weapon, a
      one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="weapons--weapon-categories--light-one-handed-and-two-handed-melee-weapons--light">Light:</em> A light
      weapon is easier to use in one’s off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and it can be used while grappling. A light
      weapon is used in one hand. Add the wielder’s Strength bonus (if any) to damage rolls for melee attacks with a
      light weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or one-half the wielder’s Strength bonus if it’s used in the off
      hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on damage; the Strength bonus applies as though
      the weapon were held in the wielder’s primary hand only.
    </p>
    <p>An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="weapons--weapon-categories--light-one-handed-and-two-handed-melee-weapons--one-handed">One-Handed:</em> A
      one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder’s Strength bonus to
      damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or 1/2 his or her
      Strength bonus if it’s used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat,
      add 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength bonus to damage rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="weapons--weapon-categories--light-one-handed-and-two-handed-melee-weapons--two-handed">Two-Handed:</em>
      Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength
      bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-categories--weapon-size">Weapon Size:</strong> Every weapon has a size category. This
      designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A weapon’s size category isn’t the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon’s size category is keyed to
      the size of the intended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the
      wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is
      an object of the same size category as the wielder.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="weapons--weapon-categories--weapon-size--inappropriately-sized-weapons"
        >Inappropriately Sized Weapons:</em
      >
      A creature can’t make optimum use of a weapon that isn’t properly sized for it. A cumulative –2 penalty applies on
      attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the size of its
      actual wielder. If the creature isn’t proficient with the weapon a –4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed,
      or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between
      the wielder’s size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. If a weapon’s designation would
      be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can’t wield
      the weapon at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-categories--improvised-weapons">Improvised Weapons:</strong> Sometimes objects not
      crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any
      creature that uses one in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls
      made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its
      relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a
      threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range
      increment of 10 feet.
    </p>
    <h3 id="weapons--weapon-qualities">Weapon Qualities</h3>
    <p>Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on Table: Weapons, below).</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-qualities--cost">Cost:</strong> This value is the weapon’s cost in gold pieces (gp) or
      silver pieces (sp). The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      This cost is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-qualities--damage">Damage:</strong> The Damage columns give the damage dealt by the
      weapon on a successful hit. The column labeled “Dmg (S)” is for Small weapons. The column labeled “Dmg (M)” is for
      Medium weapons. If two damage ranges are given then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure
      given for the double weapon’s extra attack. Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage gives weapon damage values for
      weapons of those sizes.

    <p>
      Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon is of two types, the damage it deals is not half one type
      and half another; all of it is both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage
      to ignore any of the damage from such a weapon.
    </p>

      In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation when the damage type is

      weapons are described under Special Substances and Items.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--arrows">Arrows:</strong> An arrow used as a melee weapon is treated as a
      light improvised weapon (–4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier
      x2). Arrows come in a leather quiver that holds 20 arrows. An arrow that hits its target is destroyed; one that
      misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--axe-orc-double">Axe, Orc Double:</strong> An orc double axe is a double
      weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack
      penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light
      weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature wielding an orc double axe in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can
      be used in any given round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--bolas">Bolas:</strong> You can use this weapon to make a ranged trip
      attack against an opponent. You can’t be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a set of bolas.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--bolts">Bolts:</strong> A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated
      as a light improvised weapon (–4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (crit x2).
      Bolts come in a wooden case that holds 10 bolts (or 5, for a repeating crossbow). A bolt that hits its target is
      destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--bullets-sling">Bullets, Sling:</strong> Bullets come in a leather pouch
      that holds 10 bullets. A bullet that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being
      destroyed or lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--chain-spiked">Chain, Spiked:</strong> A spiked chain has reach, so you
      can strike opponents 10 feet away with it. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, it can be used
      against an adjacent foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can make trip attacks with the chain. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the chain
      to avoid being tripped.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using a spiked chain, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the
      roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack
      rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--crossbow-hand">Crossbow, Hand:</strong> You can draw a hand crossbow
      back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each
      hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--crossbow-heavy">Crossbow, Heavy:</strong> You draw a heavy crossbow back
      by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow
      with one hand at a –4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a
      penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two one-handed weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty
      for one-handed firing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--crossbow-light">Crossbow, Light:</strong> You draw a light crossbow back
      by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow
      with one hand at a –2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a
      penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for
      one-handed firing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--crossbow-repeating">Crossbow, Repeating:</strong> The repeating crossbow
      (whether heavy or light) holds 5 crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the
      reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner as
      you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to use the
      reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--dagger">Dagger:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks
      made to conceal a dagger on your body (see the Sleight of Hand skill).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--flail-dire">Flail, Dire:</strong> A dire flail is a double weapon. You
      can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties
      associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A
      creature wielding a dire flail in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon— only one end of the weapon can be used
      in any given round.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using a dire flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the opposed
      attack roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop
      the dire flail to avoid being tripped.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--flail-or-heavy-flail">Flail or Heavy Flail:</strong> With a flail, you
      get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such
      an attempt fails).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop
      the flail to avoid being tripped.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--gauntlet">Gauntlet:</strong> This metal glove lets you deal lethal
      damage rather than nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes. A strike with a gauntlet is otherwise considered an
      unarmed attack. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy armors (except breastplate)
      come with gauntlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--gauntlet-spiked">Gauntlet, Spiked:</strong> Your opponent cannot use a
      disarm action to disarm you of spiked gauntlets. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. An attack
      with a spiked gauntlet is considered an armed attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--glaive">Glaive:</strong> A glaive has reach. You can strike opponents 10
      feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--guisarme">Guisarme:</strong> A guisarme has reach. You can strike
      opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use it to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the
      guisarme to avoid being tripped.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--halberd">Halberd:</strong> If you use a ready action to set a halberd
      against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use a halberd to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the
      halberd to avoid being tripped.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--hammer-gnome-hooked">Hammer, Gnome Hooked:</strong> A gnome hooked
      hammer is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the
      normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon
      and a light weapon. The hammer’s blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (crit x3). Its
      hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (crit x4). You can use either head as the primary
      weapon. The other head is the offhand weapon. A creature wielding a gnome hooked hammer in one hand can’t use it
      as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use a gnome hooked hammer to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can
      drop the gnome hooked hammer to avoid being tripped.
    </p>
    <p>Gnomes treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--javelin">Javelin:</strong> Since it is not designed for melee, you are
      treated as nonproficient with it and take a –4 penalty on attack rolls if you use a javelin as a melee weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--kama">Kama:</strong> The kama is a special monk weapon. This designation
      gives a monk wielding a kama special options.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use a kama to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the kama to
      avoid being tripped.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--lance">Lance:</strong> A lance deals double damage when used from the
      back of a charging mount. It has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it
      against an adjacent foe.
    </p>
    <p>While mounted, you can wield a lance with one hand.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--longbow">Longbow:</strong> You need at least two hands to use a bow,
      regardless of its size. A longbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted. If you have a penalty for low
      Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a longbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it
      to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow (see below) but not a regular longbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--longbow-composite">Longbow, Composite:</strong> You need at least two
      hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are
      made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with
      proficiency). If your Strength bonus is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can’t effectively
      use it, so you take a –2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of
      +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating to take
      advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to
      the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.
    </p>
    <p>For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--longspear">Longspear:</strong> A longspear has reach. You can strike
      opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe. If you use a ready action to set a
      longspear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--net">Net:</strong> A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a
      net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net’s maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target
      is entangled. An entangled creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty on Dexterity, can move at
      only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength
      check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the
      entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a DC 15 Concentration check or be unable to cast the
      spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points
      and can be burst with a DC 25 Strength check (also a full-round action).
    </p>
    <p>A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.</p>
    <p>
      A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal
      ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2
      rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a nonproficient one to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--nunchaku">Nunchaku:</strong> The nunchaku is a special monk weapon. This
      designation gives a monk wielding a nunchaku special options. With a nunchaku, you get a +2 bonus on opposed
      attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--quarterstaff">Quarterstaff:</strong> A quarterstaff is a double weapon.
      You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties
      associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A
      creature wielding a quarterstaff in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be
      used in any given round.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarterstaff is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a quarterstaff special options.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--ranseur">Ranseur:</strong> A ranseur has reach. You can strike opponents
      10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a ranseur, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid
      being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--rapier">Rapier:</strong> You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply
      your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a rapier sized for you, even though
      it isn’t a light weapon for you. You can’t wield a rapier in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength
      bonus to damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--sai">Sai:</strong> With a sai, you get a +4 bonus on opposed attack
      rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).
    </p>
    <p>The sai is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a sai special options.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--scythe">Scythe:</strong> A scythe can be used to make trip attacks. If
      you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the scythe to avoid being tripped.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--shield-heavy-or-light">Shield, Heavy or Light:</strong> You can bash
      with a shield instead of using it for defense. See Armor for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--shortbow">Shortbow:</strong> You need at least two hands to use a bow,
      regardless of its size. You can use a shortbow while mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to
      damage rolls when you use a shortbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when
      you use a composite shortbow (see below) but not a regular shortbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--shortbow-composite">Shortbow, Composite:</strong> You need at least two
      hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite shortbow while mounted. All composite bows are
      made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with
      proficiency). If your Strength bonus is lower than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can’t effectively
      use it, so you take a –2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier
      of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite shortbow can be made with a high strength rating to take
      advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to
      the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--shortspear">Shortspear:</strong> A shortspear is small enough to wield
      one-handed. It may also be thrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--shuriken">Shuriken:</strong> A shuriken is a special monk weapon. This
      designation gives a monk wielding shuriken special options. A shuriken can’t be used as a melee weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting
      masterwork or otherwise special versions of them and what happens to them after they are thrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--siangham">Siangham:</strong> The siangham is a special monk weapon. This
      designation gives a monk wielding a siangham special options.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--sickle">Sickle:</strong> A sickle can be used to make trip attacks. If
      you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the sickle to avoid being tripped.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--sling">Sling:</strong> Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls
      when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand.
      Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an
      attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take
      a –1 penalty on attack rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--spear">Spear:</strong> A spear can be thrown. If you use a ready action
      to set a spear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--spiked-armor">Spiked Armor:</strong> You can outfit your armor with
      spikes, which can deal damage in a grapple or as a separate attack. See Armor for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--spiked-shield-heavy-or-light">Spiked Shield, Heavy or Light:</strong>
      You can bash with a spiked shield instead of using it for defense. See Armor for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--strike-unarmed">Strike, Unarmed:</strong> A Medium character deals 1d3
      points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike. A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk
      or any character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes,
      at her option. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give
      you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply
      your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--sword-bastard">Sword, Bastard:</strong> A bastard sword is too large to
      use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A character can use a bastard sword
      two-handed as a martial weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--sword-two-bladed">Sword, Two-Bladed:</strong> A two-bladed sword is a
      double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal
      attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a
      light weapon. A creature wielding a two-bladed sword in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of
      the weapon can be used in any given round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--trident">Trident:</strong> This weapon can be thrown. If you use a ready
      action to set a trident against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--urgrosh-dwarven">Urgrosh, Dwarven:</strong> A dwarven urgrosh is a
      double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal
      attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a
      light weapon. The urgrosh’s axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a
      piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other is the
      off-hand weapon. A creature wielding a dwarven urgrosh in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of
      the weapon can be used in any given round.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use a ready action to set an urgrosh against a charge, you deal double damage if you score a hit against a
      charging character. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part of the weapon
      that deals damage.
    </p>
    <p>Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--waraxe-dwarven">Waraxe, Dwarven:</strong> A dwarven waraxe is too large
      to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A Medium character can use a dwarven
      waraxe two-handed as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. A dwarf treats a
      dwarven waraxe as a martial weapon even when using it in one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="weapons--weapon-descriptions--whip">Whip:</strong> A whip deals nonlethal damage. It deals no damage
      to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated
      as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don’t threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In
      addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including
      adjacent foes).
    </p>
    <p>Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.</p>
    <p>
      You can make trip attacks with a whip. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the whip to
      avoid being tripped.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using a whip, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to
      keep from being disarmed if the attack fails).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack
      rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon for you.
    </p>
    <h3 id="weapons--masterwork-weapons">Masterwork Weapons</h3>
    <p>
      A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on
      attack rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can’t add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork weapon
      (see the Craft skill). The masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp to the cost of a
      single unit of ammunition). Adding the masterwork quality to a double weapon costs twice the normal increase (+600
      gp).
    </p>
    <p>
      Masterwork ammunition is damaged (effectively destroyed) when used. The enhancement bonus of masterwork ammunition
      does not stack with any enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality. The enhancement bonus granted by the
      masterwork quality doesn’t stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon’s magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can’t create a masterwork version of such
      an item that confers an enhancement bonus on attack rolls. Instead, masterwork armor and shields have lessened
      armor check penalties.
    </p>
    <h2 id="armor">Armor</h2>
    <h3 id="armor--armor-qualities">Armor Qualities</h3>
    <p>
      To wear heavier armor effectively, a character can select the Armor Proficiency feats, but most classes are
      automatically proficient with the armors that work best for them.
    </p>
    <p>Armor and shields can take damage from some types of attacks.</p>
    <p>Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on Table: Armor and Shields, below).</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-qualities--cost">Cost:</strong> The cost of the armor for Small or Medium humanoid
      creatures. See Armor for Unusual Creatures, below, for armor prices for other creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-qualities--armorshield-bonus">Armor/Shield Bonus:</strong> Each armor grants an armor
      bonus to AC, while shields grant a shield bonus to AC. The armor bonus from a suit of armor doesn’t stack with
      other effects or items that grant an armor bonus. Similarly, the shield bonus from a shield doesn’t stack with
      other effects that grant a shield bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-qualities--maximum-dex-bonus">Maximum Dex Bonus:</strong> This number is the maximum
      Dexterity bonus to AC that this type of armor allows. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing the wearer’s ability
      to dodge blows. This restriction doesn’t affect any other Dexterity-related abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if a character’s Dexterity bonus to AC drops to 0 because of armor, this situation does not count as losing a
      Dexterity bonus to AC.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your character’s encumbrance (the amount of gear he or she carries) may also restrict the maximum Dexterity bonus
      that can be applied to his or her Armor Class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="armor--armor-qualities--maximum-dex-bonus--shields">Shields:</em> Shields do not affect a character’s
      maximum Dexterity bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-qualities--armor-check-penalty">Armor Check Penalty:</strong> Any armor heavier than
      leather hurts a character’s ability to use some skills. An armor check penalty number is the penalty that applies
      to Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble checks by a character
      wearing a certain kind of armor. Double the normal armor check penalty is applied to Swim checks. A character’s
      encumbrance (the amount of gear carried, including armor) may also apply an armor check penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="armor--armor-qualities--armor-check-penalty--shields">Shields:</em> If a character is wearing armor and
      using a shield, both armor check penalties apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="armor--armor-qualities--armor-check-penalty--nonproficient-with-armor-worn"
        >Nonproficient with Armor Worn:</em
      >
      A character who wears armor and/or uses a shield with which he or she is not proficient takes the armor’s (and/or
      shield’s) armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all Strength-based and Dexterity-based ability and skill
      checks. The penalty for nonproficiency with armor stacks with the penalty for nonproficiency with shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="armor--armor-qualities--armor-check-penalty--sleeping-in-armor">Sleeping in Armor:</em> A character who
      sleeps in medium or heavy armor is automatically fatigued the next day. He or she takes a –2 penalty on Strength
      and Dexterity and can’t charge or run. Sleeping in light armor does not cause fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-qualities--arcane-spell-failure">Arcane Spell Failure:</strong> Armor interferes with the
      gestures that a spellcaster must make to cast an arcane spell that has a somatic component. Arcane spellcasters
      face the possibility of arcane spell failure if they’re wearing armor. Bards can wear light armor without
      incurring any arcane spell failure chance for their bard spells.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="armor--armor-qualities--arcane-spell-failure--casting-an-arcane-spell-in-armor"
        >Casting an Arcane Spell in Armor:</em
      >
      A character who casts an arcane spell while wearing armor must usually make an arcane spell failure roll. The
      number in the Arcane Spell Failure Chance column on Table: Armor and Shields is the chance that the spell fails
      and is ruined. If the spell lacks a somatic component, however, it can be cast with no chance of arcane spell
      failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="armor--armor-qualities--arcane-spell-failure--shields">Shields:</em> If a character is wearing armor and
      using a shield, add the two numbers together to get a single arcane spell failure chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-qualities--speed">Speed:</strong> Medium or heavy armor slows the wearer down. The number
      on Table: Armor and Shields is the character’s speed while wearing the armor. Humans, elves, half-elves, and
      half-orcs have an unencumbered speed of 30 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      They use the first column. Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have an unencumbered speed of 20 feet. They use the
      second column. Remember, however, that a dwarf ’s land speed remains 20 feet even in medium or heavy armor or when
      carrying a medium or heavy load.
    </p>
    <p><em id="armor--armor-qualities--speed--shields">Shields:</em> Shields do not affect a character’s speed.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-qualities--weight">Weight:</strong> This column gives the weight of the armor sized for a
      Medium wearer. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and armor for Large characters weighs twice
      as much.

    <h3 id="armor--armor-descriptions">Armor Descriptions</h3>
    <p>
      Any special benefits or accessories to the types of armor found on Table: Armor and Shields are described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--armor-spikes">Armor Spikes:</strong> You can have spikes added to your
      armor, which allow you to deal extra piercing damage (see Table: Weapons) on a successful grapple attack. The
      spikes count as a martial weapon. If you are not proficient with them, you take a –4 penalty on grapple checks
      when you try to use them. You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they
      count as a light weapon in this case. (You can’t also make an attack with armor spikes if you have already made an
      attack with another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.)
    </p>
    <p>
      An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes’ effectiveness, but the spikes can be made
      into magic weapons in their own right.
    </p>
    <p><strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--banded-mail">Banded Mail:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
    <p><strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--breastplate">Breastplate:</strong> It comes with a helmet and greaves.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--buckler">Buckler:</strong> This small metal shield is worn strapped to your
      forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to
      wield a weapon (whether you are using an off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed
      weapon), but you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This penalty stacks with those that may apply
      for fighting with your off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off
      hand, you don’t get the buckler’s AC bonus for the rest of the round.
    </p>
    <p>You can’t bash someone with a buckler.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--chain-shirt">Chain Shirt:</strong> A chain shirt comes with a steel cap.
    </p>
    <p><strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--chainmail">Chainmail:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--full-plate">Full Plate:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather
      boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate
      must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a
      new owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4x100) gold pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--gauntlet-locked">Gauntlet, Locked:</strong> This armored gauntlet has small
      chains and braces that allow the wearer to attach a weapon to the gauntlet so that it cannot be dropped easily. It
      provides a +10 bonus on any roll made to keep from being disarmed in combat. Removing a weapon from a locked
      gauntlet or attaching a weapon to a locked gauntlet is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The price given is for a single locked gauntlet. The weight given applies only if you’re wearing a breastplate,
      light armor, or no armor. Otherwise, the locked gauntlet replaces a gauntlet you already have as part of the
      armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the gauntlet is locked, you can’t use the hand wearing it for casting spells or employing skills. (You can
      still cast spells with somatic components, provided that your other hand is free.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a normal gauntlet, a locked gauntlet lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed
      strike.
    </p>
    <p><strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--half-plate">Half-Plate:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
    <p><strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--scale-mail">Scale Mail:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--shield-heavy-wooden-or-steel">Shield, Heavy, Wooden or Steel:</strong> You
      strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A heavy shield is so heavy that you can’t use your
      shield hand for anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="armor--armor-descriptions--shield-heavy-wooden-or-steel--wooden-or-steel">Wooden or Steel:</em> Wooden and
      steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently to special attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="armor--armor-descriptions--shield-heavy-wooden-or-steel--shield-bash-attacks">Shield Bash Attacks:</em>
      You can bash an opponent with a heavy shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. See Table: Weapons for the damage
      dealt by a shield bash. Used this way, a heavy shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of
      penalties on attack rolls, treat a heavy shield as a one-handed weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you
      lose its AC bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An enhancement bonus on a shield does not
      improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--shield-light-wooden-or-steel">Shield, Light, Wooden or Steel:</strong> You
      strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A light shield’s weight lets you carry other items in
      that hand, although you cannot use weapons with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="armor--armor-descriptions--shield-light-wooden-or-steel--wooden-or-steel">Wooden or Steel:</em> Wooden and
      steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently to special attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="armor--armor-descriptions--shield-light-wooden-or-steel--shield-bash-attacks">Shield Bash Attacks:</em>
      You can bash an opponent with a light shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. See Table: Weapons for the damage
      dealt by a shield bash. Used this way, a light shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of
      penalties on attack rolls, treat a light shield as a light weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose
      its AC bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An enhancement bonus on a shield does not
      improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--shield-tower">Shield, Tower:</strong> This massive wooden shield is nearly
      as tall as you are. In most situations, it provides the indicated shield bonus to your AC. However, you can
      instead use it as total cover, though you must give up your attacks to do so. The shield does not, however,
      provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are
      holding. You cannot bash with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      When employing a tower shield in combat, you take a –2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield’s
      encumbrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--shield-spikes">Shield Spikes:</strong> When added to your shield, these
      spikes turn it into a martial piercing weapon that increases the damage dealt by a shield bash as if the shield
      were designed for a creature one size category larger than you. You can’t put spikes on a buckler or a tower
      shield. Otherwise, attacking with a spiked shield is like making a shield bash attack (see above).
    </p>
    <p>
      An enhancement bonus on a spiked shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but a
      spiked shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.
    </p>
    <p><strong id="armor--armor-descriptions--splint-mail">Splint Mail:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
    <h3 id="armor--masterwork-armor">Masterwork Armor</h3>
    <p>
      Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of armor or shields. Such a well-made item
      functions like the normal version, except that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the normal cost for that type of armor
      or shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      The masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield never provides a bonus on attack or damage rolls, even if the
      armor or shield is used as a weapon.
    </p>
    <p>All magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality.</p>
    <p>
      You can’t add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork
      item.
    </p>
    <h3 id="armor--armor-for-unusual-creatures">Armor for Unusual Creatures</h3>
    <p>
      Armor and shields for unusually big creatures, unusually little creatures, and nonhumanoid creatures have
      different costs and weights from those given on Table: Armor and Shields. Refer to the appropriate line on the
      table below and apply the multipliers to cost and weight for the armor type in question.

    <h3 id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear">Adventuring Gear</h3>
    <p>
      few of the pieces of adventuring gear found on Table: Goods and Services are described below, along with any
      special benefits they confer on the user (“you”).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--caltrops">Caltrops:</strong> A caltrop is a four-pronged iron
      spike crafted so that one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the
      ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2- pound
      bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an
      area), it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For
      this attack, the creature’s shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes
      or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped
      on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature’s speed is reduced by one-half because its foot is
      wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal
      check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical curing. A charging or running creature must immediately
      stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of
      caltrops with no trouble.
    </p>
    <p>Caltrops may not be effective against unusual opponents.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--candle">Candle:</strong> A candle dimly illuminates a 5-foot

      bonus on Strength checks made for such purposes. If used in combat, treat a crowbar as a one-handed improvised
      weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--flint-and-steel">Flint and Steel:</strong> Lighting a torch with
      flint and steel is a full-round action, and lighting any other fire with them takes at least that long.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--grappling-hook">Grappling Hook:</strong> Throwing a grappling
      hook successfully requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 per 10 feet of distance thrown).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--hammer">Hammer:</strong> If a hammer is used in combat, treat it
      as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a spiked gauntlet of its size.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--ink">Ink:</strong> This is black ink. You can buy ink in other
      colors, but it costs twice as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--jug-clay">Jug, Clay:</strong> This basic ceramic jug is fitted
      with a stopper and holds 1 gallon of liquid.

      15-foot radius, provides shadowy illumination out to a 30-foot radius, and burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You
      can carry a lamp in one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--lantern-bullseye">Lantern, Bullseye:</strong> A bullseye lantern
      provides clear illumination in a 60-foot cone and shadowy illumination in a 120-foot cone. It burns for 6 hours on
      a pint of oil. You can carry a bullseye lantern in one hand.

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--manacles-and-manacles-masterwork"
        >Manacles and Manacles, Masterwork:</strong
      >
      Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 30, or
      DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork
      manacles). Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points.
    </p>
    <p>Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the cost of the manacles.</p>
    <p>For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature.</p>
    <p>
      For a Large creature, manacles cost ten times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, one hundred times
      this amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made
      manacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--oil">Oil:</strong> A pint of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern.
      You can use a flask of oil as a splash weapon. Use the rules for alchemist’s fire, except that it takes a full
      round action to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting
      successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If
      lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--ram-portable">Ram, Portable:</strong> This iron-shod wooden beam
      gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to break open a door and it allows a second person to
      help you without having to roll, increasing your bonus by 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--rope-hempen">Rope, Hempen:</strong> This rope has 2 hit points
      and can be burst with a DC 23 Strength check.

    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--rope-silk">Rope, Silk:</strong> This rope has 4 hit points and
      can be burst with a DC 24 Strength check. It is so supple that it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Rope
      checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--spyglass">Spyglass:</strong> Objects viewed through a spyglass
      are magnified to twice their size.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--torch">Torch:</strong> A torch burns for 1 hour, clearly
      illuminating a 20-foot radius and providing shadowy illumination out to a 40- foot radius. If a torch is used in
      combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of
      its size, plus 1 point of fire damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--adventuring-gear--vial">Vial:</strong> A vial holds 1 ounce of liquid. The
      stoppered container usually is no more than 1 inch wide and 3 inches high.
    </p>

      (alchemy) skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--special-substances-and-items--acid">Acid:</strong> You can throw a flask of acid
      as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit
      deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of
      acid damage from the splash.
    </p>

      <strong id="goods-and-services--special-substances-and-items--alchemists-fire">Alchemist’s Fire:</strong> You can
      throw a flask of alchemist’s fire as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range
      increment of 10 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes
      1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6
      points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before
      taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground
      provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames
      automatically smothers the fire.

      <strong id="goods-and-services--special-substances-and-items--antitoxin">Antitoxin:</strong> If you drink

      <strong id="goods-and-services--special-substances-and-items--everburning-torch">Everburning Torch:</strong> This
      otherwise normal torch has a <i>continual flame</i> spell cast upon it. An everburning torch clearly illuminates a
      20-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination out to a 40-foot radius.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--special-substances-and-items--holy-water">Holy Water:</strong> Holy water damages
      undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash
      weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the
      body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the
      holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are
      adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each
      such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.

      <strong id="goods-and-services--special-substances-and-items--smokestick">Smokestick:</strong> This alchemically
      treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when ignited. The smoke fills a 10- foot cube (treat
      the effect as a <i>fog cloud</i> spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round).
      The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--special-substances-and-items--sunrod">Sunrod:</strong> This 1-foot-long,
      gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. It clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy
      illumination in a 60-foot radius. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--special-substances-and-items--tanglefoot-bag">Tanglefoot Bag:</strong> When you
      throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes
      apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An
      entangled creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex
      save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or
      larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make
      a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot
      bag does not function underwater.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by
      dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or
      another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the
      creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move
      (including flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a DC 15
      Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and
      losing its effectiveness. An application of
      <i>universal solvent</i> to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--special-substances-and-items--thunderstone">Thunderstone:</strong> You can throw
      this stone as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck
      hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread
      must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious
      effects, takes a –4 penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal
      component that it tries to cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since you don’t need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square. Treat the target
      square as AC 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--special-substances-and-items--tindertwig">Tindertwig:</strong> The alchemical
      substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame
      with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder.
      Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action (rather than a full-round action), and lighting any other
      fire with one is at least a standard action.

        >Barding, Medium Creature and Large Creature:</strong
      >
      Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount.
      Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed.
      Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on Table: Armor and Shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armor for a horse (a Large nonhumanoid creature) costs four times as much as armor for a human (a Medium humanoid
      creature) and also weighs twice as much as the armor found on Table: Armor and Shields (see Armor for Unusual
      Creatures). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the cost is only double, and the weight is the
      same as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the
      table below.

      fore, aft, and amidships. This ship cannot make sea voyages and sticks to the coast. It moves about 4 miles per
      hour when being rowed or under sail.

      <strong id="goods-and-services--transport--keelboat">Keelboat:</strong> This 50- to 75-foot-long ship is 15 to 20
      feet wide and has a few oars to supplement its single mast with a square sail. It has a crew of eight to fifteen
      and can carry 40 to 50 tons of cargo or 100 soldiers. It can make sea voyages, as well as sail down rivers (thanks
      to its flat bottom). It moves about 1 mile per hour.

      <strong id="goods-and-services--transport--sled">Sled:</strong> This is a wagon on runners for moving through snow
      and over ice. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A sled comes with the harness needed to
      pull it.

      <strong id="goods-and-services--transport--warship">Warship:</strong> This 100-foot-long ship has a single mast,
      although oars can also propel it. It has a crew of 60 to 80 rowers. This ship can carry 160 soldiers, but not for
      long distances, since there isn’t room for supplies to support that many people. The warship cannot make sea
      voyages and sticks to the coast. It is not used for cargo. It moves about 2-1/2 miles per hour when being rowed or
      under sail.

      <strong id="goods-and-services--spellcasting-and-services--coach-cab">Coach Cab:</strong> The price given is for a
      ride in a coach that transports people (and light cargo) between towns. For a ride in a cab that transports
      passengers within a city, 1 copper piece usually takes you anywhere you need to go.

      <strong id="goods-and-services--spellcasting-and-services--hireling-trained">Hireling, Trained:</strong> The
      amount given is the typical daily wage for mercenary warriors, masons, craftsmen, scribes, teamsters, and other
      trained hirelings. This value represents a minimum wage; many such hirelings require significantly higher pay.

      <strong id="goods-and-services--spellcasting-and-services--road-or-gate-toll">Road or Gate Toll:</strong> A toll
      is sometimes charged to cross a well-trodden, well-kept, and well-guarded road to pay for patrols on it and for
      its upkeep. Occasionally, a large walled city charges a toll to enter or exit (or sometimes just to enter).

      <strong id="goods-and-services--spellcasting-and-services--ships-passage">Ship’s Passage:</strong> Most ships do
      not specialize in passengers, but many have the capability to take a few along when transporting cargo. Double the
      given cost for creatures larger than Medium or creatures that are otherwise difficult to bring aboard a ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="goods-and-services--spellcasting-and-services--spell">Spell:</strong> The indicated amount is how much
      it costs to get a spellcaster to cast a spell for you. This cost assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and
      have the spell cast at his or her convenience (generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time
      to prepare the spell in question). If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell you need to
      negotiate with him or her, and the default answer is no.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cost given is for a spell with no cost for a material component or focus component and no XP cost. If the
      spell includes a material component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the
      spell. If the spell has an XP cost, add 5 gp per XP lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, if a spell has dangerous consequences, the spellcaster will certainly require proof that you can and
      will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to cast such a
      spell, which isn’t certain). In the case of spells that transport the caster and characters over a distance, you
      will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell, even if you aren’t returning with the caster.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general, you
      must travel to a small town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster capable of
      casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd-level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4th-level spells, a large
      city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells. Even a metropolis isn’t
      guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to cast 9th-level spells.
