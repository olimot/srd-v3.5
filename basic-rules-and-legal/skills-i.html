    <h1>SKILLS I</h1>

    <h2 id="skills-summary">Skills Summary</h2>
    <p>
      If you buy a class skill, your character gets 1 rank (equal to a +1 bonus on checks with that skill) for each
      skill point. If you buy other classes’ skills (cross-class skills), you get 1/2 rank per skill point.
    </p>
    <p>Your maximum rank in a class skill is your character level + 3.</p>
    <p>Your maximum rank in a cross-class skill is one-half of this number (do not round up or down).</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skills-summary--using-skills">Using Skills:</strong> To make a skill check, roll: 1d20 + skill
      modifier (Skill modifier = skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)
    </p>
    <p>
      This roll works just like an attack roll or a saving throw— the higher the roll, the better. Either you’re trying
      to match or exceed a certain Difficulty Class (DC), or you’re trying to beat another character’s check result.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skills-summary--skill-ranks">Skill Ranks:</strong> A character’s number of ranks in a skill is based
      on how many skill points a character has invested in a skill. Many skills can be used even if the character has no
      ranks in them; doing this is called making an untrained skill check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skills-summary--ability-modifier">Ability Modifier:</strong> The ability modifier used in a skill
      check is the modifier for the skill’s key ability (the ability associated with the skill’s use). The key ability
      of each skill is noted in its description.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skills-summary--miscellaneous-modifiers">Miscellaneous Modifiers:</strong> Miscellaneous modifiers
      include racial bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each skill point you spend on a class skill gets you 1 rank in that skill. Class skills are the skills found on
      your character’s class skill list. Each skill point you spend on a cross-class skill gets your character 1/2 rank
      in that skill. Cross-class skills are skills not found on your character’s class skill list. (Half ranks do not
      improve your skill check, but two 1/2 ranks make 1 rank.) You can’t save skill points to spend later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maximum rank in a class skill is the character’s level + 3. If it’s a cross-class skill, the maximum rank is
      half of that number (do not round up or down).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of whether a skill is purchased as a class skill or a cross-class skill, if it is a class skill for any
      of your classes, your maximum rank equals your total character level + 3.
    </p>
    <h2 id="using-skills">Using Skills</h2>
    <p>
      When your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well he or she does. The higher the result of
      the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular number (a DC
      or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the task, the higher the
      number you need to roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful
      attempt and avoid simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby assuring
      the best outcome. If others help, the character may succeed where otherwise he or she would fail.
    </p>
    <h3 id="using-skills--skill-checks">Skill Checks</h3>
    <p>
      A skill check takes into account a character’s training (skill rank), natural talent (ability modifier), and luck
      (the die roll). It may also take into account his or her race’s knack for doing certain things (racial bonus) or
      what armor he or she is wearing (armor check penalty), or a certain feat the character possesses, among other
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character’s skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier
      incorporates the character’s ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that skill’s key ability, plus any
      other miscellaneous modifiers that may apply, including racial bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher the
      result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an
      automatic success, and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.
    </p>
    <h4 id="using-skills--skill-checks--difficulty-class">Difficulty Class</h4>
    <p>
      Some checks are made against a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC is a number (set using the skill rules as a
      guideline) that you must score as a result on your skill check in order to succeed.

    <h4 id="using-skills--skill-checks--opposed-checks">Opposed Checks</h4>
    <p>
      An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another
      character’s check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case
      of a tie, the higher skill modifier wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break the tie.

    <h4 id="using-skills--skill-checks--trying-again">Trying Again</h4>
    <p>
      In general, you can try a skill check again if you fail, and you can keep trying indefinitely. Some skills,
      however, have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few skills are virtually useless once a
      check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a particular task. For most skills, when a character has succeeded
      once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.
    </p>
    <h4 id="using-skills--skill-checks--untrained-skill-checks">Untrained Skill Checks</h4>
    <p>
      Generally, if your character attempts to use a skill he or she does not possess, you make a skill check as normal.
      The skill modifier doesn’t have a skill rank added in because the character has no ranks in the skill. Any other
      applicable modifiers, such as the modifier for the skill’s key ability, are applied to the check.
    </p>
    <p>Many skills can be used only by someone who is trained in them.</p>
    <h4 id="using-skills--skill-checks--favorable-and-unfavorable-conditions">Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions</h4>
    <p>
      Some situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier
      for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.
    </p>
    <p>The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.</p>
    <p>
      1. Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent conditions that improve performance, such as having
      the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill Attempts), or possessing
      unusually accurate information.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Give the skill user a –2 circumstance penalty to represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being
      forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or
      doing work that can be subpar.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative
      audience or doing work that must be flawless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditions that affect your character’s ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that
      modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and
      a reduction in the check’s DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent
      different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.
    </p>
    <h4 id="using-skills--skill-checks--time-and-skill-checks">Time and Skill Checks</h4>
    <p>
      Using a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are
      standard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform
      within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity. Some
      skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action.
    </p>
    <p>These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.</p>
    <h4 id="using-skills--skill-checks--checks-without-rolls">Checks Without Rolls</h4>
    <p>
      A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or
      distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions and eliminate the luck
      factor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="using-skills--skill-checks--checks-without-rolls--taking-10">Taking 10:</strong> When your character
      is not being threatened or distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check,
      calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically
      successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases,
      taking 10 is purely a safety measure —you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor
      roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations
      where a particularly high roll wouldn’t help.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="using-skills--skill-checks--checks-without-rolls--taking-20">Taking 20:</strong>When you have plenty
      of time (generally 2 minutes for a skill that can normally be checked in 1 round, one full-round action, or one
      standard action), you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being attempted carries no
      penalties for failure, you can take 20. In other words, eventually you will get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough
      times. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes that you fail many times before succeeding.
      Taking 20 takes twenty times as long as making a single check would take.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since taking 20 assumes that the character will fail many times before succeeding, if you did attempt to take 20
      on a skill that carries penalties for failure, your character would automatically incur those penalties before he
      or she could complete the task. Common “take 20” skills include Escape Artist, Open Lock, and Search.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="using-skills--skill-checks--checks-without-rolls--ability-checks-and-caster-level-checks"
        >Ability Checks and Caster Level Checks:</strong
      >
      The normal take 10 and take 20 rules apply for ability checks. Neither rule applies to caster level checks.
    </p>
    <h3 id="using-skills--combining-skill-attempts">Combining Skill Attempts</h3>
    <p>
      When more than one character tries the same skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may
      overlap.
    </p>
    <h4 id="using-skills--combining-skill-attempts--individual-events">Individual Events</h4>
    <p>
      Often, several characters attempt some action and each succeeds or fails independently. The result of one
      character’s Climb check does not influence the results of other characters Climb check.
    </p>
    <h4 id="using-skills--combining-skill-attempts--aid-another">Aid Another</h4>
    <p>
      You can help another character achieve success on his or her skill check by making the same kind of skill check in
      a cooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character you are helping gets a +2 bonus to
      his or her check, as per the rule for favorable conditions. (You can’t take 10 on a skill check to aid another.)
      In many cases, a character’s help won’t be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results you can’t aid another to grant a bonus to a
      task that your character couldn’t achieve alone.
    </p>
    <h4 id="using-skills--combining-skill-attempts--skill-synergy">Skill Synergy</h4>
    <p>
      It’s possible for a character to have two skills that work well together. In general, having 5 or more ranks in
      one skill gives the character a +2 bonus on skill checks with each of its synergistic skills, as noted in the
      skill description. In some cases, this bonus applies only to specific uses of the skill in question, and not to
      all checks. Some skills provide benefits on other checks made by a character, such as those checks required to use
      certain class features.
    </p>
    <h3 id="using-skills--ability-checks">Ability Checks</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes a character tries to do something to which no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an
      ability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate ability modifier. Essentially, you’re
      making an untrained skill check.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, an action is a straight test of one’s ability with no luck involved. Just as you wouldn’t make a
      height check to see who is taller, you don’t make a Strength check to see who is stronger.
    </p>
    <h2 id="skill-descriptions">Skill Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
      This section describes each skill, including common uses and typical modifiers. Characters can sometimes use
      skills for purposes other than those noted here.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the format for skill descriptions.</p>
    <h3 id="skill-descriptions--skill-name">Skill Name</h3>
    <p>The skill name line includes (in addition to the name of the skill) the following information.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--skill-name--key-ability">Key Ability:</strong> The abbreviation of the ability
      whose modifier applies to the skill check. <i>Exception:</i> Speak Language has “None” as its key ability because
      the use of this skill does not require a check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--skill-name--trained-only">Trained Only:</strong> If this notation is included in
      the skill name line, you must have at least 1 rank in the skill to use it. If it is omitted, the skill can be used
      untrained (with a rank of 0). If any special notes apply to trained or untrained use, they are covered in the
      Untrained section (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--skill-name--armor-check-penalty">Armor Check Penalty:</strong> If this notation is
      included in the skill name line, an armor check penalty applies (when appropriate) to checks using this skill. If
      this entry is absent, an armor check penalty does not apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skill name line is followed by a general description of what using the skill represents. After the description
      are a few other types of information:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--skill-name--check">Check:</strong> What a character (“you” in the skill
      description) can do with a successful skill check and the check’s DC.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--skill-name--action">Action:</strong> The type of action using the skill requires,
      or the amount of time required for a check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--skill-name--try-again">Try Again:</strong> Any conditions that apply to successive
      attempts to use the skill successfully. If the skill doesn’t allow you to attempt the same task more than once, or
      if failure carries an inherent penalty (such as with the Climb skill), you can’t take 20. If this paragraph is
      omitted, the skill can be retried without any inherent penalty, other than the additional time required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--skill-name--special">Special:</strong> Any extra facts that apply to the skill,
      such as special effects deriving from its use or bonuses that certain characters receive because of class, feat
      choices, or race.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--skill-name--synergy">Synergy:</strong> Some skills grant a bonus to the use of one
      or more other skills because of a synergistic effect. This entry, when present, indicates what bonuses this skill
      may grant or receive because of such synergies. See Table 4–5 for a complete list of bonuses granted by synergy
      between skills (or between a skill and a class feature).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--skill-name--restriction">Restriction:</strong> The full utility of certain skills
      is restricted to characters of certain classes or characters who possess certain feats. This entry indicates
      whether any such restrictions exist for the skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--skill-name--untrained">Untrained:</strong> This entry indicates what a character
      without at least 1 rank in the skill can do with it. If this entry doesn’t appear, it means that the skill
      functions normally for untrained characters (if it can be used untrained) or that an untrained character can’t
      attempt checks with this skill (for skills that are designated as “Trained Only”).
    </p>
    <h3 id="skill-descriptions--appraise-int">Appraise <small>(Int)</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--appraise-int--check">Check:</strong> You can appraise common or well-known objects
      with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its
      actual value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is
      successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item’s value.
    </p>
    <p>
      A magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly
      detailed, such as a gem. A merchant’s scale gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any
      items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals.
    </p>
    <p>These bonuses stack.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--appraise-int--action">Action:</strong> Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten

      object, regardless of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--appraise-int--special">Special:</strong> A dwarf gets a +2 racial bonus on
      Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items because dwarves are familiar with valuable items of all
      kinds (especially those made of stone or metal).
    </p>
    <p>The master of a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks.</p>
    <p>A character with the Diligent feat gets a +2 bonus on Appraise checks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--appraise-int--synergy">Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 ranks in any Craft skill,
      you gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill.

      You are considered flat-footed while balancing, since you can’t move to avoid a blow, and thus you lose your

      You can try to walk across a precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a –5 penalty, you can move
      your full speed as a move action. (Moving twice your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, one for each
      move action used.) You may also accept this penalty in order to charge across a precarious surface; charging
      requires one Balance check for each multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof ) that you charge.

    <h3 id="skill-descriptions--bluff-cha">Bluff <small>(Cha)</small></h3>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--bluff-cha--check">Check:</strong> A Bluff check is opposed by the target’s Sense
      Motive check. See the accompanying table for examples of different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the
      target’s Sense Motive check for each one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh
      against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its
      self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it’s important, you can distinguish between a bluff
      that fails because the target doesn’t believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target.
      For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky,
      and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn’t so much see through the bluff as prove
      reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round
      or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not a
      <i>suggestion</i> spell.
    </p>
    <p>A bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--bluff-cha--check--feinting-in-combat">Feinting in Combat:</em> You can also use Bluff
      to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can’t dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a
      Bluff check opposed by your target’s Sense Motive check, but in this case, the target may add its base attack
      bonus to the roll along with any other applicable modifiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your Bluff check result exceeds this special Sense Motive check result, your target is denied its Dexterity
      bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack must be made on or before your
      next turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it’s harder to read a strange creature’s body
      language; you take a –4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it’s even
      harder; you take a –8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it’s impossible.
    </p>
    <p>Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--bluff-cha--check--creating-a-diversion-to-hide">Creating a Diversion to Hide:</em> You
      can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to
      attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--bluff-cha--check--delivering-a-secret-message">Delivering a Secret Message:</em> You
      can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. The DC is 15 for
      simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure
      by 4 or less means you can’t get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has
      been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff
      check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message (see Sense Motive).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--bluff-cha--action">Action:</strong> Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general
      interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round action), but it can take much longer if
      you try something elaborate. A Bluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a standard
      action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message doesn’t take an action; it is part of normal communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--bluff-cha--try-again">Try Again:</strong> Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check
      in social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again in the same circumstances, but you may
      retry freely on Bluff checks made to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a
      message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per round.
    </p>
    <p>Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication.</p>

      You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell or take some

      You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton,

      It’s practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall’s DC + 20) to

      If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or
      she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though
      he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a
      Climb check (DC = wall’s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his or her total
      weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb
      check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character’s fall but don’t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5
      or more, you fail to stop the character’s fall and begin falling as well.

      whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some
      action that requires your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell, concentrating on an active spell,
      directing a spell, using a spell-like ability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity. In
      general, if an action wouldn’t normally provoke an attack of opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check
      to avoid being distracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action
      automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost. If you were
      concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a
      spell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were using a spell-like ability, that use of the
      ability is lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have other ramifications as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check. If the
      distraction occurs while you are trying to cast a spell, you must add the level of the spell you are trying to
      cast to the appropriate Concentration DC. If more than one type of distraction is present, make a check for each
      one; any failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not completed.

      <strong id="skill-descriptions--concentration-con--try-again">Try Again:</strong> Yes, though a success doesn’t

      The DC of the check is 15 (plus the spell’s level, if casting a spell or using a spell-like ability defensively).
      If the Concentration check succeeds, you may attempt the action normally without provoking any attacks of
      opportunity. A successful Concentration check still doesn’t allow you to take 10 on another check if you are in a
      stressful situation; you must make the check normally. If the Concentration check fails, the related action also
      automatically fails (with any appropriate ramifications), and the action is wasted, just as if your concentration
      had been disrupted by a distraction.

    <h3 id="skill-descriptions--craft-int">Craft <small>(Int)</small></h3>
    <p>
      Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several
      Craft skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably
      falls under the heading of a Profession skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--craft-int--check">Check:</strong> You can practice your trade and make a decent
      living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the
      tools of your trade, how to perform the craft’s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle
      common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC
      depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and the price of the item
      determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item’s finished price also determines the cost of raw
      materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, the <i>fabricate</i> spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check
      involved. However, you must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high
      degree of craftsmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the <i>ironwood</i> spell
      enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When casting the spell <i>minor creation</i>, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex
      item.
    </p>
    <p>
      All crafts require artisan’s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is
      made with a –2 circumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan’s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus
      on the check.
    </p>
    <p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.</p>
    <p>1. Find the item’s price. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</p>
    <p>2. Find the DC from the table below.</p>
    <p>3. Pay one-third of the item’s price for the cost of raw materials.</p>
    <p>
      4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week’s work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result
      by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the
      result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in
      one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result ×
      the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made this week. Record the result and make
      a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the
      item in silver pieces.
    </p>
    <p>If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week.</p>
    <p>
      If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--craft-int--check--progress-by-the-day">Progress by the Day:</em> You can make checks
      by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result × DC) is in copper pieces instead of
      silver pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--craft-int--check--creating-masterwork-items">Creating Masterwork Items:</em> You can
      make a masterwork item—a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its
      exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork
      component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own
      price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard
      component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. <i>Note:</i> The cost you
      pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--craft-int--check--repairing-items">Repairing Items:</em> Generally, you can repair an
      item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing
      an item is one-fifth of the item’s price.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use the Craft skill to make a particular sort of item, the DC for checks involving the creation of that
      item are typically as given on the following table.

      If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you
      fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it. If you’re attempting some sort of
      sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall
      off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).

      A rogue who beats a trap’s DC by 10 or more can study the trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (along with

      + the spell level of the magic used to create it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spells <i>fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol,</i> and <i>teleportation circle</i> also create traps that a
      rogue can disarm with a successful Disable Device check. <i>Spike growth</i> and <i>spike stones,</i> however,
      create magic traps against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for

    <h4 id="skill-descriptions--disable-device-int-trained-only--other-ways-to-beat-a-trap">
      Other Ways to Beat a Trap
    </h4>
    <p>It’s possible to ruin many traps without making a Disable Device check.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--disable-device-int-trained-only--other-ways-to-beat-a-trap--ranged-attack-traps"
        >Ranged Attack Traps:</strong
      >
      Once a trap’s location is known, the obvious way to ruin it is to smash the mechanism—assuming the mechanism can
      be accessed. Failing that, it’s possible to plug up the holes from which the projectiles emerge. Doing this
      prevents the trap from firing unless its ammunition does enough damage to break through the plugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--disable-device-int-trained-only--other-ways-to-beat-a-trap--melee-attack-traps"
        >Melee Attack Traps:</strong
      >
      These devices can be thwarted by smashing the mechanism or blocking the weapons, as noted above. Alternatively, if
      a character studies the trap as it triggers, he might be able to time his dodges just right to avoid damage. A
      character who is doing nothing but studying a trap when it first goes off gains a +4 dodge bonus against its
      attacks if it is triggered again within the next minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--disable-device-int-trained-only--other-ways-to-beat-a-trap--pits">Pits:</strong>
      Disabling a pit trap generally ruins only the trapdoor, making it an uncovered pit. Filling in the pit or building
      a makeshift bridge across it is an application of manual labor, not the Disable Device skill. Characters could
      neutralize any spikes at the bottom of a pit by attacking them—they break just as daggers do.

      <strong id="skill-descriptions--disable-device-int-trained-only--other-ways-to-beat-a-trap--magic-traps"
        >Magic Traps:</strong

      <i>Dispel magic</i> helps here. Someone who succeeds on a caster level check against the level of the trap’s
      creator suppresses the trap for 1d4 rounds. This works only with a targeted <i>dispel magic,</i> not the area
      version (see the spell description).

      <em id="skill-descriptions--handle-animal-cha-trained-only--check--handle-an-animal">Handle an Animal:</em> This
      task involves commanding an animal to perform a task or trick that it knows. If the animal is wounded or has taken
      any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs
      the task or trick on its next action.
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Push” an Animal:</i> To push an animal means to get it to perform a task or trick that it doesn’t know but is
      physically capable of performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a forced march or forcing it
      to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or
      ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its
      next action.

        >Teach an Animal a Trick:</em
      >
      You can teach an animal a specific trick with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal check against the
      indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with
      an Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible tricks (and their associated DCs) include,
      but are not necessarily limited to, the following.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the
      animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids,
      giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead
      and aberrations) counts as two tricks.
    </p>
    <p>Come (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.</p>
    <p>
      Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any
      command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn’t know this trick
      continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches
      some random object.
    </p>
    <p>Guard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.</p>
    <p>Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn’t go.</p>
    <p>
      Perform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or
      barking, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>Seek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.</p>
    <p>
      Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that
      come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Track (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to have the scent ability)
    </p>
    <p>Work (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.</p>
    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--handle-animal-cha-trained-only--check--train-an-animal-for-a-purpose"
        >Train an Animal for a Purpose:</em
      >
      Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an
      animal’s purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or
      heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If
      the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional
      tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose
      requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combat Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down,
      guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also “upgrade” an animal trained
      for riding to one trained for combat riding by spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal
      check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal’s previous purpose and any tricks it once
      knew. Warhorses and riding dogs are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they don’t require any
      additional training for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an
      animal for fighting takes three weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal
      for guarding takes four weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for
      heavy labor takes two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track.
      Training an animal for hunting takes six weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay.
      Training an animal for performance takes five weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for
      riding takes three weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em id="skill-descriptions--handle-animal-cha-trained-only--check--rear-a-wild-animal">Rear a Wild Animal:</em> To
      rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as
      many as three creatures of the same kind at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      A successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it’s being raised, or it can be taught as
      a domesticated animal later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--handle-animal-cha-trained-only--action">Action:</strong> Varies. Handling an
      animal is a move action, while pushing an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can handle her animal
      companion as a free action or push it as a move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must
      spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the
      task before you attempt the Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the
      animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must
      invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the
      task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--handle-animal-cha-trained-only--try-again">Try Again:</strong> Yes, except for
      rearing an animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--handle-animal-cha-trained-only--special">Special:</strong> You can use this skill
      on a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any such check increases
      by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks known as animals do.
    </p>
    <p>A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal checks involving her animal companion.</p>
    <p>
      In addition, a druid’s or ranger’s animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, which don’t count against the
      normal limit on tricks known and don’t require any training time or Handle Animal checks to teach.
    </p>
    <p>If you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks.</p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--handle-animal-cha-trained-only--synergy">Synergy:</strong> If you have 5 or more
      ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks and wild empathy checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="skill-descriptions--handle-animal-cha-trained-only--untrained">Untrained:</strong> If you have no
      ranks in Handle Animal, you can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you can’t teach,
      rear, or train animals. A druid or ranger with no ranks in Handle Animal can use a Charisma check to handle and
      push her animal companion, but she can’t teach, rear, or train other nondomestic animals.
