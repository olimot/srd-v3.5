    <h3 id="paladin--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are class features of the paladin.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with
      all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Aura of Good (Ex):</strong> The power of a paladin’s aura of good (see the <i>detect good</i> spell) is
      equal to her paladin level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Detect Evil</i> (Sp):</strong> At will, a paladin can use <i>detect evil</i>, as the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Smite Evil (Su):</strong> Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack.
      She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. If
      the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still
      used up for that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as
      indicated on Table: The Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Divine Grace (Su):</strong> At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on
      all saving throws.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Lay on Hands (Su):</strong> Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can
      heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage
      equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus. A paladin may choose to divide her healing among multiple
      recipients, and she doesn’t have to use it all at once. Using lay on hands is a standard action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on
      hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The
      paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead
      creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Aura of Courage (Su):</strong> Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise).
      Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.
    </p>
    <p>This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Divine Health (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including
      supernatural and magical diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Turn Undead (Su):</strong>When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn
      undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as
      a cleric of three levels lower would.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells:</strong> Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine
      spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell list. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The
      Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a paladin’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin’s Wisdom
      modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base
      daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Paladin. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a
      high Wisdom score. When Table: The Paladin indicates that the paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell
      level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level The
      paladin does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.
    </p>
    <p>
      A paladin prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to
      spontaneously cast a <i>cure</i> spell in its place. A paladin may prepare and cast any spell on the paladin spell
      list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her
      daily meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is one-half her
      paladin level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Special Mount</i> (Sp):</strong> Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin gains the service of an unusually
      intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil (see below). This mount is usually a
      heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin).
    </p>
    <p>
      Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount from the celestial realms in which it
      resides. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin’s level. The mount
      immediately appears adjacent to the paladin and remains for 2 hours per paladin level; it may be dismissed at any
      time as a free action. The mount is the same creature each time it is summoned, though the paladin may release a
      particular mount from service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously.
      The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed. Calling a mount is a
      conjuration (calling) effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should the paladin’s mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. The
      paladin may not summon another mount for thirty days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first,
      even if the mount is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the paladin takes a –1 penalty
      on attack and weapon damage rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><i>Remove Disease</i> (Sp):</strong> At 6th level, a paladin can produce a <i>remove disease</i> effect,
      as the spell, once per week. She can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after
      6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class abilities if she
      ever willingly commits an evil act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, a paladin’s code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not
      cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for evil or
      chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Associates:</strong> While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin
      will never knowingly associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who
      consistently offends her moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful
      good.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ex-paladins">Ex-Paladins</h3>
    <p>
      A paladin who ceases to be lawful good, who willfully commits an evil act, or who grossly violates the code of
      conduct loses all paladin spells and abilities (including the service of the paladin’s mount, but not weapon,
      armor, and shield proficiencies). She may not progress any farther in levels as a paladin. She regains her
      abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her violations (see the <i>atonement</i> spell description),
      as appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a member of any other class, a paladin may be a multiclass character, but multiclass paladins face a special
      restriction. A paladin who gains a level in any class other than paladin may never again raise her paladin level,
      though she retains all her paladin abilities.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-paladins-mount">The Paladin’s Mount</h3>
    <p>
      The paladin’s mount is superior to a normal mount of its kind and has special powers, as described below. The
      standard mount for a Medium paladin is a heavy warhorse, and the standard mount for a Small paladin is a warpony.
      Another kind of mount, such as a riding dog (for a halfling paladin) or a Large shark (for a paladin in an aquatic
      campaign) may be allowed as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      A paladin’s mount is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the purpose of all effects that depend on its
      type (though it retains an animal’s HD, base attack bonus, saves, skill points, and feats).

      <strong>Paladin’s Mount Basics:</strong> Use the base statistics for a creature of the mount’s kind,but make
      changes to take into account the attributes and characteristics summarized on the table and described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Bonus HD:</em> Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Extra
      Hit Dice improve the mount’s base attack and base save bonuses. A special mount’s base attack bonus is equal to
      that of a cleric of a level equal to the mount’s HD. A mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a
      character whose level equals the animal’s HD). The mount gains additional skill points or feats for bonus HD as
      normal for advancing a monster’s Hit Dice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Natural Armor Adj.:</em> The number on the table is an improvement to the mount’s existing natural armor
      bonus.
    </p>
    <p><em>Str Adj.:</em> Add this figure to the mount’s Strength score.</p>
    <p><em>Int:</em> The mount’s Intelligence score.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Empathic Link (Su):</em> The paladin has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile.
      The paladin cannot see through the mount’s eyes, but they can communicate empathically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that even intelligent mounts see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are always possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this empathic link, the paladin has the same connection to an item or place that her mount does, just
      as with a master and his familiar (see Familiars).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Improved Evasion (Ex):</em> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half
      damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Share Spells:</em> At the paladin’s option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts
      on herself also affect her mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a
      duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not
      affect the mount again even if it returns to the paladin before the duration expires. Additionally, the paladin
      may cast a spell with a target of “You” on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A paladin and
      her mount can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the mount’s type (magical
      beast).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Share Saving Throws:</em> For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the
      paladin’s, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn’t share any
      other bonuses on saves that the master might have.
    </p>
    <p><em>Improved Speed (Ex):</em> The mount’s speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Command (Sp):</em> Once per day per two paladin levels of its master, a mount can use this ability to command
      other any normal animal of approximately the same kind as itself (for warhorses and warponies, this category
      includes donkeys, mules, and ponies), as long as the target creature has fewer Hit Dice than the mount. This
      ability functions like the <i>command</i> spell, but the mount must make a DC 21 Concentration check to succeed if
      it’s being ridden at the time. If the check fails, the ability does not work that time, but it still counts
      against the mount’s daily uses. Each target may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin’s level + paladin’s Cha
      modifier) to negate the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Spell Resistance (Ex):</em> A mount’s spell resistance equals its master’s paladin level + 5. To affect the
      mount with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or
      exceeds the mount’s spell resistance.

    <p>All of the following are class features of the ranger.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and
      with light armor and shields (except tower shields).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Favored Enemy (Ex):</strong> At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given
      on Table: Ranger Favored Enemies. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival
      checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls
      against such creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional
      favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored
      enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as
      indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger’s
      bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

      like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and
      his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude
      of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be
      within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way
      takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he
      takes a –4 penalty on the check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Combat Style (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery
      or two-weapon combat. This choice affects the character’s class features but does not restrict his selection of
      feats or special abilities in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal
      prerequisites for that feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not
      have the normal prerequisites for that feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The benefits of the ranger’s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his
      combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Endurance:</strong> A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Animal Companion (Ex):</strong> At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the
      following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake
      (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the
      following creatures may be added to the ranger’s list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid.
      This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name, except that the ranger’s effective druid level is
      one-half his ranger level. A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a druid
      can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an
      alternative animal if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells:</strong> Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine
      spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see
      below).
    </p>
    <p>
      To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The
      Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger’s Wisdom
      modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base
      daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a
      high Wisdom score. When Table: The Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level,
      he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The ranger
      does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ranger prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though he cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a
      <i>cure</i> spell in its place. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he
      can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his ranger
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved Combat Style (Ex):</strong> At 6th level, a ranger’s aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery
      or two-weapon combat) improves. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot feat,
      even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting
      feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As before, the benefits of the ranger’s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all
      benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Woodland Stride (Ex):</strong> Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth
      (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking
      damage or suffering any other impairment.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still
      affect him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Swift Tracker (Ex):</strong> Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following
      tracks without taking the normal –5 penalty. He takes only a –10 penalty (instead of the normal –20) when moving
      at up to twice normal speed while tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great
      agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a
      successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no
      armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Combat Style Mastery (Ex):</strong> At 11th level, a ranger’s aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery
      or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved
      Precise Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting
      feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As before, the benefits of the ranger’s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all
      benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Camouflage (Ex):</strong> A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural
      terrain, even if the terrain doesn’t grant cover or concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):</strong> While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger of 17th level or higher
      can use the Hide skill even while being observed.

    <h3 id="rogue--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are class features of the rogue.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand
      crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sneak Attack:</strong> If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively
      from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rogue’s attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the
      target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at
      1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a
      sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.
    </p>
    <p>Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>
    <p>
      With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead
      of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not
      even with the usual –4 penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies—undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and
      incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable
      to sneak attacks. The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able
      to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs
      of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Trapfinding:</strong> Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has
      a Difficulty Class higher than 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC
      of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC
      of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rogue who beats a trap’s DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works,
      and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Evasion (Ex):</strong> At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with
      great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on
      a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no
      armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Trap Sense (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from
      traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made
      by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when
      she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.
    </p>
    <p>Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would
      normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or
      struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see
      below) instead.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</strong> A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked.</p>
    <p>
      This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker
      has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains
      improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the
      minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Special Abilities:</strong> On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and
      19th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Crippling Strike (Ex):</em> A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her
      blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength
      damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Defensive Roll (Ex):</em> The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than
      she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a
      weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this
      ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only
      half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react
      to it in order to execute her defensive roll—if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can’t use this
      ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue’s
      evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Improved Evasion (Ex):</em> This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage
      on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed
      save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Opportunist (Ex):</em> Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has
      just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue’s attack of opportunity
      for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can’t use the opportunist ability more than once per
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Skill Mastery:</em> The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably
      even under adverse conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a
      skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her
      from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply
      to each time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Slippery Mind (Ex):</em> This ability represents the rogue’s ability to wriggle free from magical effects that
      would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect
      and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra
      chance to succeed on her saving throw.
    </p>
    <p><em>Feat:</em> A rogue may gain a bonus feat in place of a special ability.</p>

    <h3 id="sorcerer--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not
      proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer’s gestures, which can
      cause his spells with somatic components to fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells:</strong> A sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell
      list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see
      below).
    </p>
    <p>
      To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The
      Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer’s Charisma
      modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base
      daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Sorcerer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a
      high Charisma score.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sorcerer’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two
      1st-level spells of your choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on
      Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by his
      Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells
      chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some
      understanding of by study. The sorcerer can’t use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster
      rate, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer
      can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer “loses” the old spell in
      exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must
      be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer spell the sorcerer can cast. A sorcerer may swap only
      a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains
      new spells known for the level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at
      any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to decide
      ahead of time which spells he’ll cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Familiar:</strong> A sorcerer can obtain a familiar (see below). Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up
      magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually
      tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases
      in power.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw.
      Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount.
      However, a sorcerer’s experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar’s demise or
      dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised
      from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy
      event occurs.
    </p>
    <p>A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.</p>

      Script (Int), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). See
      Chapter 4: Skills for skill descriptions.

    <h3 id="wizard--class-features">Class Features</h3>
    <p>All of the following are class features of the wizard.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</strong> Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light
      crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a wizard’s
      movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells:</strong> A wizard casts arcane spells which are drawn from the sorcerer/ wizard spell list. A
      wizard must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell
      level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a wizard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard’s
      Intelligence modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like other spellcasters, a wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base
      daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Wizard. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a
      high Intelligence score.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike a bard or sorcerer, a wizard may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of
      time by getting a good night’s sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the wizard
      decides which spells to prepare.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Languages:</strong> A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the
      character because of her race.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Familiar:</strong> A wizard can obtain a familiar in exactly the same manner as a sorcerer can. See the
      sorcerer description and the information on Familiars below for details.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Scribe Scroll:</strong> At 1st level, a wizard gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bonus Feats:</strong> At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such
      opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet
      all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.
    </p>
    <p>
      These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard
      is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing these
      feats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spellbooks:</strong> A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare
      any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for <i>read magic</i>, which all wizards can prepare from memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from her prohibited
      school or schools, if any; see School Specialization, below) plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each
      point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At
      each new wizard level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new
      wizard level) for her spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards’ spellbooks to
      her own.
    </p>
    <h3 id="school-specialization">School Specialization</h3>
    <p>
      A school is one of eight groupings of spells, each defined by a common theme. If desired, a wizard may specialize
      in one school of magic (see below). Specialization allows a wizard to cast extra spells from her chosen school,
      but she then never learns to cast spells from some other schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      A specialist wizard can prepare one additional spell of her specialty school per spell level each day. She also
      gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn the spells of her chosen school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wizard must choose whether to specialize and, if she does so, choose her specialty at 1st level. At this time,
      she must also give up two other schools of magic (unless she chooses to specialize in divination; see below),
      which become her prohibited schools.
    </p>
    <p>A wizard can never give up divination to fulfill this requirement.</p>
    <p>
      Spells of the prohibited school or schools are not available to the wizard, and she can’t even cast such spells
      from scrolls or fire them from wands. She may not change either her specialization or her prohibited schools
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eight schools of arcane magic are abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion,
      necromancy, and transmutation.
    </p>
    <p>Spells that do not fall into any of these schools are called universal spells.</p>
    <p><em>Abjuration:</em> Spells that protect, block, or banish. An abjuration specialist is called an abjurer.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Conjuration:</em> Spells that bring creatures or materials to the caster. A conjuration specialist is called a
      conjurer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Divination:</em> Spells that reveal information. A divination specialist is called a diviner. Unlike the other
      specialists, a diviner must give up only one other school.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Enchantment:</em> Spells that imbue the recipient with some property or grant the caster power over another
      being. An enchantment specialist is called an enchanter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Evocation:</em> Spells that manipulate energy or create something from nothing. An evocation specialist is
      called an evoker.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Illusion:</em> Spells that alter perception or create false images. An illusion specialist is called an
      illusionist.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Necromancy:</em> Spells that manipulate, create, or destroy life or life force. A necromancy specialist is
      called a necromancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Transmutation:</em> Spells that transform the recipient physically or change its properties in a more subtle
      way. A transmutation specialist is called a transmuter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Universal:</em> Not a school, but a category for spells that all wizards can learn. A wizard cannot select
      universal as a specialty school or as a prohibited school. Only a limited number of spells fall into this
      category.
    </p>
    <h3 id="familiars">Familiars</h3>
    <p>
      A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a
      sorcerer or wizard. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats
      of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any
      effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion
      cannot also function as a familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A familiar also grants special abilities to its master (a sorcerer or wizard), as given on the table below. These
      special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar
      abilities that depend on the master’s level.

    <p>
      <strong>Familiar Basics:</strong> Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar’s kind, but make the
      following changes:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Hit Dice:</em> For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master’s character level or
      the familiar’s normal HD total, whichever is higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Hit Points:</em> The familiar has one-half the master’s total hit points (not including temporary hit points),
      rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Attacks:</em> Use the master’s base attack bonus, as calculated from all his classes. Use the familiar’s
      Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to get the familiar’s melee attack bonus with natural
      weapons.
    </p>
    <p>Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar’s kind.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Saving Throws:</em> For each saving throw, use either the familiar’s base save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2,
      Will +0) or the master’s (as calculated from all his classes), whichever is better. The familiar uses its own
      ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn’t share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Skills:</em> For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill
      ranks for an animal of that type or the master’s skill ranks, whichever are better. In either case, the familiar
      uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar’s total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond
      the familiar’s ability to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Familiar Ability Descriptions:</strong> All familiars have special abilities (or impart abilities to their
      masters) depending on the master’s combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table below.
      The abilities given on the table are cumulative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Natural Armor Adj.:</em> The number noted here is an improvement to the familiar’s existing natural armor
      bonus.
    </p>
    <p><em>Int:</em> The familiar’s Intelligence score.</p>
    <p><em>Alertness (Ex):</em> While a familiar is within arm’s reach, the master gains the Alertness feat.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Improved Evasion (Ex):</em> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half
      damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw
      fails.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Share Spells:</em> At the master’s option, he may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts on
      himself also affect his familiar. The familiar must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the
      benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the familiar if it moves
      farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the familiar again even if it returns to the master before the
      duration expires. Additionally, the master may cast a spell with a target of “You” on his familiar (as a touch
      range spell) instead of on himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A master and his familiar can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the familiar’s
      type (magical beast).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Empathic Link (Su):</em> The master has an empathic link with his familiar out to a distance of up to 1 mile.
      The master cannot see through the familiar’s eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the limited
      nature of the link, only general emotional content can be communicated.
    </p>
    <p>Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Deliver Touch Spells (Su):</em> If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for
      him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate
      his familiar as the “toucher.” The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As usual,
      if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Speak with Master (Ex):</em> If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate
      verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without
      magical help.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Speak with Animals of Its Kind (Ex):</em> If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate
      with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, rats with
      rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with
      amphibians, weasels with similar creatures (weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks, wolverines, and badgers).
      Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Spell Resistance (Ex):</em> If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to
      the master’s level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster
      level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar’s spell resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Scry on Familiar (Sp):</em> If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting
      the <i>scrying</i> spell) once per day.

    <h3 id="arcane-spells-and-armor">Arcane Spells and Armor</h3>
    <p>Wizards and sorcerers do not know how to wear armor effectively.</p>
    <p>
      If desired, they can wear armor anyway (though they’ll be clumsy in it), or they can gain training in the proper
      use of armor (with the various Armor Proficiency feats—light, medium, and heavy—and the Shield Proficiency feat),
      or they can multiclass to add a class that grants them armor proficiency. Even if a wizard or sorcerer is wearing
      armor with which he or she is proficient, however, it might still interfere with spellcasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armor restricts the complicated gestures that a wizards or sorcerer must make while casting any spell that has a
      somatic component (most do). The armor and shield descriptions list the arcane spell failure chance for different
      armors and shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      By contrast, bards not only know how to wear light armor effectively, but they can also ignore the arcane spell
      failure chance for such armor. A bard wearing armor heavier than light or using any type of shield incurs the
      normal arcane spell failure chance, even if he becomes proficient with that armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a spell doesn’t have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can cast it with no problem while wearing
      armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster’s hands are bound or if he or she is grappling (although
      Concentration checks still apply normally). Also, the metamagic feat Still Spell allows a spellcaster to prepare
      or cast a spell at one spell level higher than normal without the somatic component. This also provides a way to
      cast a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.
    </p>
    <h2 id="multiclass-characters">Multiclass Characters</h2>
    <p>
      A character may add new classes as he or she progresses in level, thus becoming a multiclass character. The class
      abilities from a character’s different classes combine to determine a multiclass character’s overall abilities.
      Multiclassing improves a character’s versatility at the expense of focus.

    <h3 id="class-and-level-features">Class and Level Features</h3>
    <p>
      As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum of the abilities of each of the character’s
      classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Level:</strong> “Character level” is a character’s total number of levels. It is used to determine when
      feats and ability score boosts are gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Class level” is a character’s level in a particular class. For a character whose levels are all in the same
      class, character level and class level are the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hit Points:</strong> A character gains hit points from each class as his or her class level increases,
      adding the new hit points to the previous total.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Base Attack Bonus:</strong> Add the base attack bonuses acquired for each class to get the character’s
      base attack bonus. A resulting value of +6 or higher provides the character with multiple attacks.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Add the base save bonuses for each class together.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Skills:</strong> If a skill is a class skill for any of a multiclass character’s classes, then character
      level determines a skill’s maximum rank. (The maximum rank for a class skill is 3 + character level.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If a skill is not a class skill for any of a multiclass character’s classes, the maximum rank for that skill is
      one-half the maximum for a class skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Class Features:</strong> A multiclass character gets all the class features of all his or her classes but
      must also suffer the consequences of the special restrictions of all his or her classes. (<i>Exception:</i>
      A character who acquires the barbarian class does not become illiterate.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In the special case of turning undead, both clerics and experienced paladins have the same ability. If the
      character’s paladin level is 4th or higher, her effective turning level is her cleric level plus her paladin level
      minus 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the special case of uncanny dodge, both experienced barbarians and experienced rogues have the same ability.
      When a barbarian/rogue would gain uncanny dodge a second time (for her second class), she instead gains improved
      uncanny dodge, if she does not already have it. Her barbarian and rogue levels stack to determine the rogue level
      an attacker needs to flank her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the special case of obtaining a familiar, both wizards and sorcerers have the same ability. A sorcerer/wizard
      stacks his sorcerer and wizard levels to determine the familiar’s natural armor, Intelligence score, and special
      abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Feats:</strong> A multiclass character gains feats based on character levels, regardless of individual
      class level
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ability Increases:</strong> A multiclass character gains ability score increases based on character level,
      regardless of individual class level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Spells:</strong> The character gains spells from all of his or her spellcasting classes and keeps a
      separate spell list for each class. If a spell’s effect is based on the class level of the caster, the player must
      keep track of which class’s spell list the character is casting the spell from.
