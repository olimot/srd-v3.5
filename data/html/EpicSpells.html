spells are spells developed from the ground up using a list of magical
ingredients called seeds. Despite their power, epic spells still follow the
basic rules for casting spells, except as specifically noted otherwise. Epic
casters can manipulate the seeds of true magic, but knowing the seeds and how
to manipulate them does not instantly grant ultimate power. Each epic spell
must be laboriously developed before it can be used. </div><br><h3 id="acquiring-epic-spells">ACQUIRING EPIC
SPELLS </h3><div>A
character with the Epic Spellcasting feat may start acquiring epic spells
immediately. Using epic spells is a two-step procedure: development and
spellcasting. </div><br><h3 id="epic-spell-development">EPIC SPELL
DEVELOPMENT </h3><div>Before
it can be cast, an epic spell must be developed. The process of development can
be a time-consuming and expensive process. It is during development that a
caster determines whether a given epic spell lies within his or her abilities
or beyond them. The basis of that determination lies in an epic spell’s
Spellcraft DC. </div><div>The
easiest way to develop an epic spell is to use one already given. The
description of each of these unique spells gives the amount of gold, time, and
experience points required to develop the spell. If a character pays a spell’s
development cost, he or she develops (and thus knows) that spell. </div><div>For
information on developing an epic spell completely from scratch, see Developing
Unique Epic Spells, below. </div><br><h3 id="epic-spellcasting">EPIC SPELLCASTING </h3><div>Once
an epic spell is developed, the caster knows the spell. A developed epic spell
becomes an indelible part of the caster and may be prepared without a spellbook
(if a wizard is the caster). Characters who cast spells spontaneously, such as
sorcerers, can cast a developed epic spell by using any open epic spell slot.
Druids, clerics, and similar spellcasters can likewise prepare epic spells
using epic spell slots. </div><div>A
spellcaster can prepare or cast any epic spell he or she knows as many times
per day as he or she has available epic spell slots. A spellcaster who can cast
epic spells has a number of open epic spell slots per day equal to one-tenth
his or her ranks in the Knowledge skill appropriate to the spell and the
caster’s class. Knowledge (arcana) is appropriate for arcane casters, and
Knowledge (religion) or Knowledge (nature) is appropriate for divine casters.
The rules for rest between casting a day’s allotment of epic spells are the
same as for rest required to prepare standard spells. If the caster doesn’t use
up a day’s allotment of epic spell slots, the unused slots remain available
whether or not the spellcaster receives appropriate rest. </div><div>Even
if the epic spell has been developed and an epic spell slot is available,
successfully casting an epic spell isn’t assured. The caster’s Spellcraft skill
modifier is vital for casting an epic spell. To cast an epic spell, a spellcaster
makes a Spellcraft check against the epic spell’s Spellcraft DC. If the check
succeeds, the spell is cast. If the caster fails the check, the epic spell
fizzles and the epic spell slot is used for the day. </div><div>Because
epic spells require Spellcraft checks, a spell is beyond the caster’s ability
if the final Spellcraft DC is greater than 20 + the spellcaster’s Spellcraft
modifier. Epic spells with DCs higher than 10 + the spellcaster’s Spellcraft
modifier are risky; a caster can take 10 when casting an epic spell, but he or
she can’t take 20. When routinely casting epic spells, most spellcasters take
10 on their Spellcraft checks. </div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Epic
Spell Levels:</span><span>
Epic spells have no fixed level. However, for purposes of Concentration checks,
spell resistance, and other possible situations where spell level is important,
epic spells are all treated as if they were 10th-level spells. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Metamagic,
Items, and Epic Spells:</span><span> Metamagic feats and other epic feats that manipulate normal
spells cannot be used with epic spells. </span></div><div>A
character can’t craft a magic item that casts an epic spell, regardless of
whether the item is activated with spell completion, a spell trigger, a command
word, or simple use. Only major artifacts, which are beyond the means of even
epic characters to create, can possibly contain magic of this power. </div><div>The
saving throw against a character’s epic spell has a DC of 20 + the character’s
relevant ability score modifier. It’s possible to develop epic spells that have
even higher DCs, however, by applying the appropriate factor. </div><br><h3 id="epic-spell-terms">EPIC SPELL TERMS</h3><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Epic
Spell: </span><span>Spells
that are different from common spells. Epic spells are usually custom-made.
Epic spells do not take up normal spell slots, but instead are gained and used
under a completely separate progression. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Epic
Spell Slots: </span><span>A
character must have an available epic spell slot to prepare or cast an epic
spell, just as he or she needs a normal spell slot for a nonepic spell. A
character doesn’t gain epic spell slots by virtue of his or her level and
class, however. A character gets one epic spell slot for every 10 ranks he or
she has in the relevant Knowledge skill. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Factor:
</span><span>When
creating an epic spell, a character can modify the basic use of a seed. Each
modification is called a factor, and most factors increase the difficulty of
casting the spell. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Mitigating
Factor: </span><span>The
opposite of a normal factor, a mitigating factor modifies the spell but makes
it easier to cast. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Seed:
</span><span>Every
custom epic spell created by spellcasters begins with a base effect called a
seed. Seeds are the fundamental building blocks of epic spells. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spellcraft
DC: </span><span>For
epic spells, the Spellcraft DC is a measure of how difficult the spell is for a
spellcaster to cast. It also measures how powerful an epic spell is. </span></div><br><h3 id="epic-spell-formulas-and-calculations">EPIC SPELL FORMULAS AND
CALCULATIONS </h3><div>The
following formulas are important to epic spellcasters. </div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Epic
Spells Per Day: </span><span>Knowledge
(arcana), Knowledge (religion), or Knowledge (nature) ranks ÷ 10 (round down). </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">To
Cast an Epic Spell: </span><span>Spellcraft check (DC = epic spell’s Spellcraft DC). </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Level
of an Epic Spell: </span><span>Epic spells are considered 10th level for the purpose of
Concentration checks, spell resistance, and other determinations. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Saving
Throw for an Epic Spell: </span><span>DC = 20 + key ability modifier. </span></div><br><h3 id="dispelling-epic-spells-and-antimagic-field">DISPELLING,EPIC
SPELLS,AND ANTIMAGIC FIELD</h3><div>A
lucky nonepic spellcaster casting <span style="font-style: italic;">greater dispel magic </span>might be able to
dispel an epic spell. The game mechanics do not change, and epic spells do not
occupy any privileged position allowing them to resist being dispelled other
than their presumably high caster level. Likewise, epic spells using the <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel
</span>seed can dispel nonepic spells. Such epic spells use the same game
mechanic: The check to dispel is 1d20 + a specified number (usually dispeller’s
level), and the DC is 11 + the spellcaster’s level. </div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Antimagic
field </span><span>does
not automatically suppress epic spells as it does standard spells. Instead,
each time an epic spell is subject to an <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic fiel</span>d, make a dispel
check as a 20th-level caster (1d20 + 20). The epic spell has a DC of 11 + the
epic spell’s spellcaster level. If the suppression check is successful, the
epic spell is suppressed like any other spell. If the dispel check is
unsuccessful, the epic spell functions normally.</span></div><br><h3 id="epic-spell-descriptions">EPIC SPELL
DESCRIPTIONS</h3><div>Each
epic spell description follows the same format used for 0- to 9th-level spells<span style="font-style: italic;">.
</span>There are two additional entries for epic spells: Spellcraft DC and To
Develop. </div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spellcraft
DC:</span><span> This
is the DC of the Spellcraft check required to cast the epic spell. When casting
an epic spell, the character gains a +5 bonus on his or her Spellcraft check if
the base seed of the epic spell is from the character’s arcane school specialty
or primary psionic discipline. The character takes a –15 penalty if the epic
spell seed is from his or her prohibited arcane school.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">To
Develop:</span><span>
The first part of this entry shows the resources in gold, time, and experience
points a character must expend to develop the spell shown. If the character
expends the resources, he or she develops the spell if he or she has access to
all the seeds. Spells containing the <span style="font-style: italic;">life </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">heal </span>seed are
typically only available to those with 24 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion)
or Knowledge (nature). The rest of the development entry details the seeds and
factors used to create the epic spell. This information is provided as an
example for characters when they attempt to create and develop their own unique
epic spells. </span></div><br><h3 id="animus-blast">Animus Blast </h3><div>Evocation

casting <span style="font-style: italic;">crown of vermin, </span>one thousand venomous, biting and stinging
spiders, scorpions, beetles, and centipedes erupt from the very air around the
character. This swarm forms a living aura around the character to a radius of
10 feet. The character is immune to his or her own <span style="font-style: italic;">crown of vermi</span>n. The
swarm goes where the character goes at his or her speed, even if the character
takes to the air or water (though water drowns the vermin after 1 full round of
immersion, unless the spell is cast underwater, in which case aquatic or marine
vermin answer the call and cannot leave the water). Each vermin in the <span style="font-style: italic;">crown
of vermin </span>bites a creature who enters the area occupied by the effect (or
the character forces the effect into an area occupied by another creature) for
1 point of damage, and then dies. Each victim takes enough points of damage to
kill it, destroying that number of vermin in the process. Victims get a Reflex
saving throw each round to avoid the full press, and if successful, take only
10d10 bites (and 10d10 points of damage). A total of 1,000 points of damage can
be dealt to those who fall prey to the <span style="font-style: italic;">crown of vermi</span>n. The vermin have
damage reduction 1/epic, so the vermin’s natural weapons are treated as epic
for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If there aren’t enough vermin
to kill all the creatures in the spell’s effect, the creature with the fewest
hit points is affected first, then the creature with the second fewest hit
points, and so on. After all creatures that can be killed have been killed, any
remaining damage is distributed among the survivors equally. </div><div>The
character has utter control over the vermin in his or her aura, and can force
them into areas that would normally deter common vermin. The character can
completely suppress his or her vermin aura as a free action so that no vermin
are visible at all. The time that vermin are suppressed does not count toward
the spell’s duration. Alternatively, the character can roughly shape and move
the vermin in any fashion he or she desires within the limits of the
10-foot-radius spread as a move-equivalent action. The vermin cannot be wrested
from the character’s control through any means. The vermin make all saving
throws to avoid damaging effects using the character’s base saving throw
bonuses. They gain the character’s spell resistance, if any, and they get saving
throws against spells that would otherwise automatically slay vermin. A
character can see through his or her <span style="font-style: italic;">crown of vermin </span>without difficulty,
but gains one-half concealment against enemy attacks launched both outside and
within the character’s <span style="font-style: italic;">crown of vermi</span>n. </div><br><h3 id="damnation">Damnation </h3><div>Enchantment

character and any creatures he or she touches are drawn into the region of
dreams. The character can take more than one creature along (subject to the
character’s weight limit), but all must be touching each other. The character
physically enters the land of dreams, leaving nothing behind. For every minute
the character moves through the dream landscape, he or she can “wake” to find
him or her self five miles displaced in the waking world. The character does
not know precisely where he or she will come out in the waking world, nor the
conditions of the waking world through which the character travels. The
character knows approximately where he or she will end up based on time spent
traveling in dream. <span style="font-style: italic;">Dreamscape </span>can also be used to travel to other
planes that contain creatures that dream, but doing this requires crossing into
the dreams of outsiders, where the character is subject to the dangers of alien
dream realities. This is a potentially perilous proposition. Transferring to
another plane of existence requires 1d4 hours of uninterrupted journey. Any
creatures touched by the character when <span style="font-style: italic;">dreamscape </span>is cast also make the
transition to the borders of unconscious thought. They may opt to follow the
character, wander off into the dreams of others, or stumble back into the
waking world (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or
abandoned by the character). Creatures unwilling to accompany the character
into the region of dreams receive a Will save, negating the effect if
successful. </div><br><h3 id="eclipse">Eclipse </h3><div>Conjuration

the character creates passes in front of it, culminating in a complete blackout
and accompanying coronal ring. The eclipse follows the character across the

casting <span style="font-style: italic;">eidolon, </span>the character creates a duplicate version of him or her
self as the character was when he or she was a 21st-level character, and the
character gains one negative level while the duplicate persists. For each
additional negative level the character bestow upon him or her self at the time
of casting, the eidolon has one additional character level. No matter how many
negative levels the character bestows on him or her self, the eidolon can never
have more character levels than the character has (taking the negative levels
into account). Treat the duplicate as the character with a number of negative
levels conferred that would lower him or her to the character level of the
eidolon. The eidolon is considered fresh and rested when created. It may cast
any spell the character has access to, including an epic spell. Use the eidolon’s
Spellcraft modifier as the basis for the number of epic spells it can cast in a
day, and its effective character level as a basis for its skills, feats, and
other abilities. The eidolon is effectively lower level than the character and
probably can’t cast all the spells he or she knows. A powerful enough eidolon
might conceivably cast the <span style="font-style: italic;">eidolon </span>spell itself. The eidolon appears in
whatever mundane clothing the character desires when initially conjured, but it
has no other possessions. It shares part of the character’s soul, so it is the
character for all intents and purposes. The character and his or her <span style="font-style: italic;">eidolon
</span>communicate with each other normally. Usually, the eidolon does not
begrudge its brief existence, because it is still part of the character. If the
eidolon is killed prior to the expiration of the spell’s duration, the
character immediately regains the lost levels. Normally, the eidolon does not
last long enough to threaten the character with permanent level drain. </div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">XP

the character can communicate only basic commands. The character knows what the
subject is experiencing, but does not receive direct sensory input from it. A
subject forced to take an action against its nature receives a saving throw
with a penalty of –10 to resist taking that particular action, but if it
succeeds, it still remains the character’s thrall despite its minor mutiny. Once
a subject makes a successful saving throw to resist a specific order, it makes
all future saving throws to resist taking that specific action without a
penalty. <span style="font-style: italic;">Protection from evil </span>or a similar spell can prevent the

absorbs 20 points of each separate slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing attack

points of damage in this fashion; however, if the stored damage is not
discharged prior to reaching the 150-point limit, the spell automatically
discharges, dealing the 150 points of damage to the character. The character
keeps track of the number of points of damage he or she has absorbed (the
character doesn’t have to keep track of the type of damage). At any time during
the spell’s duration, the character can make a touch attack against another
creature or object. If successful, the character deals the target some or all
(character’s choice) of the points of damage he or she has stored. The damage
delivered is considered bludgeoning damage. A character can absorb and
discharge damage any number of times during the spell’s duration, so long as
the character doesn’t absorb more than 150 points at a time. When the spell
expires, any stored damage the character has not redirected is discharged into
the character. </div><br><h3 id="let-go-of-me">Let Go of Me </h3><div>Transmutation

effectively “cast itself.” When the character casts the spell, a stroke of
energy deals 10d6 points of electricity damage to each creature within the
spell’s area. <span style="font-style: italic;">Living lightning </span>follows all the standard rules for epic
spell casting when the character casts it. <span style="font-style: italic;">Living lightning </span>is sentient
and generally friendly toward the character. It has the character’s mental
ability scores, but it has no physical ability scores. It senses the world
through the character’s senses and communicates with him or her by thought. As
a self-triggering spell, it isn’t truly alive but is a fragment of the
character’s personality. It cares little for the world around it, but at the
character’s urging (and sometimes at its own discretion) it casts itself at his
or her foes. Casters who prepare spells before casting must prepare <span style="font-style: italic;">living
lightning </span>normally in order for it to cast itself. When the spell casts
itself, it acts on the character’s initiative but does not count against his or
her own actions in the round. The character cannot simultaneously cast <span style="font-style: italic;">living
lightning </span>while it is casting its own effect, even if it has been prepared
more than once. <span style="font-style: italic;">Living lightning </span>uses up one of the character’s epic
spell slots for the day whenever it casts itself. When the character has used
up all his or her epic spell slots for the day (or has cast all his or her
prepared <span style="font-style: italic;">living lightning </span>spells, if a caster who must prepare spells), <span style="font-style: italic;">living
lightning </span>becomes quiescent. It remains so until the character has rested

character is possessed by a dream larva. For 20 rounds, the dream larva’s body
physically replaces the character’s, though the dream larva has the character’s
equipment. The dream larva is free to call on all its own powers and abilities,
or use the character’s equipment. The character’s consciousness and physical
form are suppressed for the duration of the possession. The character has no
way to dismiss the spell, communicate, or otherwise maintain awareness once
possession has commenced. The dream larva, temporarily freed from its
imprisonment in some distant nightmare, will attempt to slay and incapacitate
any creature it can see or find, whether it is a friend or foe of the caster.
Casting <span style="font-style: italic;">lord of nightmares </span>entails some risk for the caster, since it’s
unknown what a dream larva might do over the course of 20 rounds. The larva
will dispatch all enemies it can find before turning to its own concerns.
Sometimes a dream larva will attempt to place itself in a dangerous or
precarious situation prior to the end of the spell, leaving the caster to
extricate him or herself. If the dream larva is slain during the duration of
the spell, the character’s consciousness is instantly restored to aware-ness
within his or her own body. The character’s condition remains what it was when
he or she completed casting <span style="font-style: italic;">lord of nightmare</span>s, regardless of what
damage the dream larva received. However, magic item charges used, potions
consumed, and other physical resources used up by the dream larva are

activate until the trigger conditions have been met. Each day it remains
untriggered, it uses up an epic spell slot, even if you cast it on another creature.
Once triggered, the spell is expended normally. When the character would
otherwise be subject to any instantaneous effect that would deal him or her 50
or more points of damage, he or she is instead transported to a static time
stream where time ceases to flow. The character’s condition becomes fixed—no
force or effect can harm him or her until 1 round of real time has passed.
Thus, the character avoids the damage he or she would otherwise receive, but
the character also misses out on one round of activity. To the character, no
time passes at all, but to onlookers who are part of real time, the character
stands frozen and fixed in space for 1 full round. </span></div><br><h3 id="soul-dominion">Soul Dominion </h3><div>Divination,

everything he or she does with all five senses. The target receives a Will
save, and if successful, prevents the character from making the telepathic connection.
Whether the saving throw is successful or not, the target is unaware of the
attempted intrusion. Once the subject is tapped, the character is able to hear,
see, feel, smell, and taste everything the subject senses. The character cannot
control the subject, however. The character can only see what the subject
chooses to look at, and the character tastes something only if the subject eats
or drinks it during the spell’s duration. During this time, the character’s own
body remains in a trance-like state. If the subject takes damage, the character
senses the injuries, although his or her own body does not actually suffer any
ill effects. If the subject is knocked unconscious or killed, the spell

prepared spells, the subject decides which spells to abandon at each level. If
the subject has more than one standard action allowed in the round, he or she
may spend those actions as he or she desires. The subject doesn’t realize the
spells or spell slots are gone until he or she tries to cast a spell and finds
it unavailable. Abandoning a spell slot or losing a spell is standard action,
but it does not draw an attack of opportunity. It is a purely mental exercise
not obvious to observers. </div><br><h3 id="summon-behemoth">Summon Behemoth </h3><div>Conjuration

character snatches him or her self from 1 round in the future, depositing this
future self in an adjacent space as a free action that counts as a quickened
spell. The character’s future self is technically only a possible future self
(the time stream is a maelstrom of multiple probabilities), but snatching that
future self from 1 round in the future collapses probability, and the possible
future becomes the definite future. The character and his or her future self
are both free to act normally this round (the character has already used up the
limit of one quickened spell per round, but his or her duplicate hasn’t). The
future self has all the resources the character has at the moment he or she
finishes casting <span style="font-style: italic;">time duplicat</span>e. Because the future self was previously
only a possibility, his or her resources are not depleted as a result of
whatever might occur this round (even if the character dies this round).
Likewise, he or she doesn’t have any special knowledge of what might occur
during this round. Because the future self is still part of the time stream,
the round it spends with the character is a round it misses in its own future.
Because the chracter’s future duplicate is also the character, the character
misses the next round as well. He or she simply isn’t there. Tampering with the
time stream is a tricky business. Here is a round-by-round summary. </div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Round
One: </span><span>The
character casts <span style="font-style: italic;">time duplicat</span>e, the future self from round two arrives,
and both act normally. </span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Round
Two: </span><span>The
future self—the character—gets snatched back in time to help the past self.
During this round, there are no versions of the character present. </span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Round
Three: </span><span>The
character rejoins the time stream. The character arrives in the same location
and condition that the future self ended with at the end of the first round.
Any resources (spells, damage, staff charges) the future self used up in round
one are gone for real. Record them now. Using this spell to snatch a single
future self stretches time and probability to its limit; more powerful versions
of <span style="font-style: italic;">time duplicate </span>are not possible. A character cannot bring more than a
single future version of him or her self back at one time, nor can a character
snatch a version of him or her from farther in the future. </span></div><br><h3 id="vengeful-gaze-of-god">Vengeful Gaze of God </h3><div>Transmutation

the fast-moving growth, which otherwise deals 10d6 points of damage from the
crushing press. Buildings are engulfed and they likewise take 10d6 points of

epic spell is developed from smaller pieces called seeds and connecting pieces
called factors. Every epic seed has a base Spellcraft DC, and every factor has
a Spell-craft DC adjustment. When a desired spell is developed, the spellcaster
spends resources and time to assemble the pieces that make up the epic spell.
The base Spellcraft DCs of each seed are added together; then the DC
adjustments of the factors are added to that total. The sum equals the final
Spellcraft DC for the epic spell. </div><div>The
final Spellcraft DC is the most significant gauge of the epic spell’s power. A
spellcaster attempts to cast an epic spell by making a Spellcraft check against
the epic spell’s Spellcraft DC. Thus, a spellcaster knows immediately, based on
his or her own Spellcraft bonus, what epic spells are within his or her
capability to cast, which are risky, and which are beyond him or her. Epic
casters don’t commit time and money to develop epic spells until they are
powerful enough to cast them. </div><div>An
epic spell developed by an arcane spellcaster is arcane, and an epic spell
developed by a divine spellcaster is divine. A character who can cast both
divine and arcane epic spells chooses whether a particular spell he or she
develops will be arcane or divine. If that same caster uses the <span style="font-style: italic;">heal </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">life
</span>seed in an epic spell, that spell is always considered divine. All the epic
spells described here can be developed independently by a character who spends
the necessary time, money, and experience points. Alternatively, a character
can use those spells as a starting point when creating customized versions of
the spells. </div><br><div style="font-weight: 700;">Table: Epic Seeds </div><div class="table-container"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="margin-left: -0.75pt; border-collapse: collapse;

to develop the spell, rounded up to whole days. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">XP
Cost:</span><span> To
develop an epic spell, a character must spend 1/25 of its resource price in
experience points. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Adding
Seed DCs: </span><span>When
two or more epic seeds are combined in an epic spell, their base Spellcraft DCs
are added together. Both contribute toward the spell’s final Spellcraft DC. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Determining
School:</span><span>
When combining two or more seeds to develop an epic spell, the school of the
finished spell is decided by the caster from among the seeds that make up the
epic spell. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Combining
Descriptors: </span><span>When
two or more epic seeds are combined in an epic spell, all the descriptors from
each seed apply to the finished spell. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Combining
Components and Casting Times: </span><span>Almost every epic spell has verbal and somatic components
and a 1-minute casting time, regardless of the number of epic seeds combined.
The only exceptions are epic spells with the <span style="font-style: italic;">heal </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">life </span>seeds,
which have divine focus components. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Combining
Range, Targets, Area, and Effect:</span><span> One seed might have a range of 12,000 feet, another
seed might have a range of 400 feet, and a third seed might not have a range at
all. Likewise, some seeds have targets, while others have an effect or an area.
To determine which seed takes precedence in the finished epic spell, the
character must decide which seed is the base seed. The seed most important to
the spell’s overall purpose is the base seed, and it determines the casting
time, range, target, and so on. The other seeds apply only their specific
effects to the finished spell. It is occasionally difficult to determine a base
seed by examining the spell’s effects. If no one seed is most important, simply
pick one seed for the purposes of making this determination. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Combining
Durations:</span><span>
When combining two or more seeds to develop an epic spell, the seed with the
shortest duration determines the duration of the finished epic spell. If any
seed of an epic spell is dismissible by the caster, the epic spell is
dismissible. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Saving
Throws:</span><span>
Even if more than one seed has an associated saving throw, the final spell will
have only a single saving throw. If two or more seeds have the same kind of
saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will), then obviously that will be used for
the spell’s saving throw. If the seeds have different kinds of saving throws,
simply choose the saving throw that seems most appropriate for the final spell.
</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Spell
Resistance:</span><span>
When combining two or more seeds to develop an epic spell, if even one seed is
subject to spell resistance, the finished epic spell is subject to it as well. </span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Factors:
</span><span>Factors
are not part of epic seeds, but they are the tools used to modify specific
parameters of any given seed. Applying factors to the seeds of an epic spell
can increase or decrease the final Spellcraft DC, increase the duration, change
the area of a spell, and affect many other aspects of the spell. </span></div><div>There are three
kinds of factors: </div><div>1.
Those that can affect a number of seeds. </div><div>2.
Those that can only be used with specific seeds. </div><div>3.
Those that reduce the Spellcraft DC rather than increasing it. These are
referred to as mitigating factors. To calculate the final Spellcraft DC of an
epic spell correctly, it’s important to determine the mitigating factors last,
after all the factors that increase the DC have been accounted for. </div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Development
Is an Art:</span><span>
Many times developing a completely new epic spell requires some guesswork and
rule stretching. As with making and pricing magic items, a sort of balancing
act is required. Often the description of a seed will need to be stretched for
a particular spell. If necessary, assess an “ad hoc” Spellcraft DC adjustment
for any effect that cannot be extrapolated from the seeds and factors presented
here—the example spells use ad hoc factors frequently. In all cases, the GM
determines the actual Spellcraft DC of the new spell</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Approval:</span><span> This is the final step, and it’s
critically important. The epic spell development work and reasoning must be
shown to the GM and receive his or her approval. If the GM doesn’t approve,
then the epic spell cannot be developed. However, the GM should explain why the

Each contingent spell in use counts as a slot used from the caster’s daily epic
spell slots. </div><div>2
Seeds that already have an instantaneous or permanent duration cannot be
increased. </div><div>3 When changing
a targeted or area seed to a touch or ranged attack, the seed no longer
requires a save if it deals damage, instead requiring a successful attack roll.
Seeds with a nondamaging effect still allow the target a save. Area spells
changed to touch or ranged attacks now affect only the creature successfully
attacked. </div><div>4 When changing
a touch or ranged attack seed to a targeted seed, the seed no longer requires an
attack roll if it deals damage, instead requiring a saving throw from the
target. On a failed saving throw, the target takes half damage. Area seeds
changed to targeted seeds now only affect the target. The GM determines the
most appropriate kind of saving throw for the epic spell. </div><div>5
Epic spells may only be inscribed on stone tablets or other substances of equal
or greater hardness. Once a spell is so inscribed, another epic spellcaster can
learn it without going through the process of development. Once an inscribed
epic spell is learned by another epic spellcaster in this fashion, the tablet
upon which it is inscribed is destroyed and cannot be mended. </div><br><div style="font-weight: 700;">Table: Epic Spell Mitigating

Mitigating factors are always applied after all epic spell factors (see above)
are accounted for in the development of an epic spell.</div><div>1
The caster cannot somehow avoid or make him or her self immune to backlash
damage. For spells with durations longer than instantaneous, the backlash
damage is per round. If backlash damage kills a caster, no spell or method
exists that will return life to the caster’s body without costing the caster a
level—not even <span style="font-style: italic;">wish, true resurrection, miracle, </span>or epic spells that
return life to the deceased<span style="font-style: italic;">. </span>Spells that normally penalize the recipient
one level when they return him or her to life penalize a caster killed by
backlash two levels. </div><div>2
When increasing the casting time of a spell in order to reduce the Spellcraft
DC, a character must first “use up” the maximum of 10 minutes (for a total DC
modifier of –20). After that, a character can continue to add days to the
casting time, with a further modifier of –2 per day, up to the maximum of 100
days.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Additional
Participants:</span><span>
Epic spells can be developed that specifically require additional participants.
These spells are called rituals. An epic spell developed as a ritual requires a
specific number of additional participants, who each must use up one spell slot
of a specified level for the day. During an epic spell’s development, the
spell’s creator determines the number of additional participants and the level
of the spell slots to be contributed. If the exact number of spellcasters does
not partake in the casting, or if the casters do not each contribute the proper
spell slot, the epic spell automatically fails. To participate, each
participant readies an action to contribute his or her raw spell energy when
the primary caster begins the epic spell. Additional participants in a ritual
spell reduce the Spellcraft DC, as shown on Table: Additional Participants in
Rituals. Each additional participant may only contribute one spell slot. It
doesn’t matter whether the additional participants are arcane or divine
spellcasters; only the level of the spell slot contributed matters. A
contributed spell slot is treated as if normally cast. A wizard may contribute
either a prepared, uncast spell slot, or an open, unprepared slot. The
Spellcraft DC adjustments for each additional participant stack. </span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Special:
</span><span>A ritual
epic spell that takes longer than 1 standard action to cast requires all extra
participants to stand as if casting for the same amount of time. If an extra
participant is attacked while contributing a spell slot, the participant must
make a Concentration check as if casting a spell of the same level as the slot
contributed. If the attack disrupts the participant in the ritual, the epic
spell is not necessarily ruined. However, the Spellcraft DC reduction that
would have been provided by that additional participant cannot be applied to
the final Spellcraft DC of the epic spell. Thus the ritual epic spell will be
harder for the primary spellcaster to cast. </span></div><br><div style="font-weight: 700;">Table: Additional Participants in

also develop a spell with this seed that afflicts the target with a –1 penalty
on caster level checks, a –1 penalty to an ability score, a –1 penalty to spell
resistance, or a –1 penalty to some other aspect of the target. For each
additional –1 penalty assessed in one of the above categories, increase the

factor is applied to increase the duration of this seed, ability score
penalties instead become temporary ability damage. If a factor is applied to
make the duration permanent, any ability score penalties become permanent
ability drain. Finally, by increasing the Spellcraft DC by +2, one of the
target’s senses can be afflicted: sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, or a
special sense the target possesses. If the target fails its saving throw, the
sense selected doesn’t function for the spell’s duration, with all attendant

his or her spoken commands. The undead can follow the caster, or they can
remain in an area and attack any creature (or a specific type of creature)
entering the place. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed. (A
destroyed undead can’t be animated again.) Intelligent undead can follow more
sophisticated commands. The <span style="font-style: italic;">animate dead </span>seed allows a character to

he or she has personally created, regardless of the method used. If the caster
exceeds this number, newly created creatures fall under his or her control, and
excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled (the caster chooses
which creatures are released). If the caster is a cleric, any undead he or she
commands through his or her ability to command or rebuke undead do not count
toward the limit. For each additional 2 HD of undead to be controlled, increase
the Spellcraft DC by +1. Only undead in excess of 20 HD created with this seed
can be controlled using this DC adjustment. To both create and control more

the subject so that it appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location;
this increases the Spellcraft DC by +2. The subject benefits from a 50% miss

concealment, this displacement effect does not prevent enemies from targeting
him or her normally. The <span style="font-style: italic;">conceal </span>seed can also be used to block

the cost of the relevant seed. Remember that two doublings equals a tripling,

creature, object, or spell is the target of the <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel </span>seed. The caster
makes a dispel check against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently
in effect on the object or creature. A dispel check is 1d20 + 10 against a DC
of 11 + the target spell’s caster level. For each additional +1 on the dispel
check, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1. If targeting an object or creature
that is the effect of an ongoing spell, make a dispel check to end the spell
that affects the object or creature. If the object targeted is a magic item,
make a dispel check against the item’s caster level. If succeessful, all the
item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item
recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of
the effect. An interdimensional interface is temporarily closed. A magic item’s

seed uses whichever one of five energy types the caster chooses: acid, cold,
electricity, fire, or sonic. The caster can cast the energy forth as a bolt,
imbue an object with the energy, or create a freestanding manifestation of the
energy. If the spell developed using the <span style="font-style: italic;">energy </span>seed releases a bolt,
that bolt instantaneously deals 10d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy
type, and all in the bolt’s area must make a Reflex save for half damage. For
each additional 1d6 points of damage dealt, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.
The bolt begins at the caster’s fingertips. To imbue another creature with the
ability to use an energy bolt as a spell-like ability at its option or when a
particular condition is met, increase the Spellcraft DC by +25. The caster can
also cause a creature or object to emanate the specific energy type out to a
radius of 10 feet for 20 hours. The emanated energy deals 2d6 points of energy
damage per round against unprotected creatures (the target creature is susceptible
if not separately warded or otherwise resistant to the energy). For each
additional 1d6 points of damage emanated, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The
caster may also create a wall, half-circle, circle, dome, or sphere of the
desired energy that emanates the energy for up to 20 hours. One side of the
wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of energy, dealing 2d4 points
of energy damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of energy damage to
those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it
appears and in each round that a creature enters or remains in the area. In
addition, the wall deals 2d6+20 points of energy damage to any creature passing
through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures. For each
additional 1d4 points of damage, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. </div><div>The
caster can also use the <span style="font-style: italic;">energy </span>seed to create a spell that carefully
releases and balances the emanation of cold, electricity, and fire, creating
specific weather effects for a period of 20 hours. Using the <span style="font-style: italic;">energy </span>seed
this way has a base Spellcraft DC of 25. The area extends to a two-mile-radius
centered on the caster. Once the spell is cast, the weather takes 10 minutes to
manifest. Ordinarily, a caster can’t directly target a creature or object,
though indirect effects are possible. This seed can create cold snaps, heat
waves, thunderstorms, fogs, blizzards—even a tornado that moves randomly in the
affected area. Creating targeted damaging effects requires an additional use of

a special use of the <span style="font-style: italic;">transport </span>seed, a caster can develop a spell that
temporarily transports him or her into a different time stream (leaving the
caster in the same physical location); this increases the Spellcraft DC by +8.
If the caster moves him or herself, or the subject, into a slower time stream
for 5 rounds, time ceases to flow for the subject, and its condition becomes
fixed—no force or effect can harm it until the duration expires. If the caster
moves him or her self into a faster time stream, the caster speeds up so greatly
that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at
their normal speeds. The caster is free to act for 5 rounds of apparent time.
Fire, cold, poison gas, and similar effects can still harm the caster. While
the caster is in the fast time stream, other creatures are invulnerable to his
or her attacks and spells; however, the caster can create spell effects and
leave them to take effect when he or she reenters normal time. Because of the
branching nature of time, epic spells used to transport a subject into a faster
time stream cannot be made permanent, nor can the duration of 5 rounds be
extended. More simply, the seed can <span style="font-style: italic;">haste </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">slow </span>a subject for

hedge out a type of creature from a specified area. A ward against standard
damage protects a creature from whichever two the caster selects of the three
damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. For a ward against all three
types, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. Each round, the spell created with the
<span style="font-style: italic;">ward </span>seed absorbs the first 5 points of damage the creature would
otherwise take, regardless of whether the source of the damage is natural or
magical. For each additional point of protection, increase the Spellcraft DC by

selects of the five energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Each

of damage is natural or magical. The spell protects the recipient’s equipment
as well. For each additional point of protection, increase the Spellcraft DC by
+1. </div><div>A
ward against a specific type of creature prevents bodily contact from whichever
one of several monster types the caster selects. This causes the natural weapon
attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks
require touching the warded creature. The protection ends if the warded
creature makes an attack against or intentionally moves within 5 feet of the
blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this
protection and touch the warded creature. </div><div>A
ward against magic creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere (with
radius 10 feet) that surrounds the caster and excludes all spell effects of up
to 1st level. Alternatively, the caster can ward just the target and not create
the radius effect. For each additional level of spells to be excluded, increase
the Spellcraft DC by +20 (but see below). The area or effect of any such spells
does not include the area of the ward, and such spells fail to affect any
target within the ward. This includes spell-like abilities and spells or
spell-like effects from magic items. However, any type of spell can be cast
through or out of the ward. The caster can leave and return to the protected
area without penalty (unless the spell specifically targets a creature and does
not provide a radius effect). The ward could be brought down by a targeted <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel

nullified, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2 per spell level above 1st. </div><br><h2 id="epic-psionic-powers">EPIC PSIONIC

characters can acquire epic powers.&nbsp; Generally, all the epic spell rules
work for epic powers as well, except as noted below for displays.</div><div>Psionic
characters take the Epic Manifestation feat, which works just like the Epic
Spellcasting feat. The prerequisites for this feat are 24 ranks of Psicraft, 24
ranks of Knowledge (psionics), and the ability to manifest 9th-level psionic
powers. </div><div>Just
as spellcasters use no spell slots to cast epic spells, psionic characters use
no power points to manifest epic powers. Instead, they freely manifest their
known epic powers a number of times per day equal to their Knowledge (psionics)

this power are very small, very minor planes.</div><div>A character can
only cast this spell while on the Ethereal Plane. When he or she casts the
spell, a local density fluctuation precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At
first, the fledgling plane grows at a rate of 1 foot in radius per day to an
initial maximum radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from
surrounding ethereal vapors and protomatter.</div><div><span>The spellcaster

determines factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general
shape of the terrain. This spell cannot create life (including vegetation), nor
can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, </span><span>dungeons, and so forth).
The spellcaster must add these things in some other fashion if he or she
desires. Once the basic demiplane reaches its maximum size, the spellcaster can
continue to cast this spell to enlarge the demiplane, adding another 180 feet
of radius to the demiplane each time.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Material
