planes of existence are different realities with interwoven connections. Except
for rare linking points, each plane is effectively its own universe with its
own natural laws. </div><div>The planes
break down into a number of general types: the Material Plane, the Transitive
Planes, the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, and the demiplanes.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Material
Plane: </span><span>The
Material Plane tends to be the most Earthlike of all planes and operates under
the same set of natural laws that our own real world does. This is the default
plane for most adventures.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Transitive
Planes:</span><span>
These three planes have one important common characteristic: Each is used to
get from one place to another. The Astral Plane is a conduit to all other
planes, while the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow both serve as means of
transportation within the Material Plane they’re connected to. These planes
have the strongest regular interaction with the Material Plane and are often
accessed by using various spells. They have native inhabitants as well.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Inner
Planes:</span><span>
These six planes are manifestations of the basic building blocks of the
universe. Each is made up of a single type of energy or element that overwhelms
all others. The natives of a particular Inner Plane are made of the same energy
or element as the plane itself.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Outer
Planes:</span><span>
The deities live on the Outer Planes, as do creatures such as celestials,
demons, and devils. Each of the Outer Planes has an alignment, representing a
particular moral or ethical outlook, and the natives of each plane tend to behave
in agreement with that plane’s alignment. The Outer Planes are also the final
resting place of souls from the Material Plane, whether that final rest takes
the form of calm introspection or eternal damnation.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Demiplanes:</span><span> This catch-all category
covers all extradimensional spaces that function like planes but have
measurable size and limited access. Other kinds of planes are theoretically
infinite in size, but a demiplane might be only a few hundred feet across.</span></div><br><h3 id="planar-traits">PLANAR TRAITS</h3><div>Each
plane of existence has its own properties—the natural laws of its universe.</div><div>Planar
traits are broken down into a number of general areas.</div><br><div>All
planes have the following kinds of traits.</div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Physical
Traits:</span><span>
These traits determine the laws of physics and nature on the plane, including
how gravity and time function.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Elemental
and Energy Traits:</span><span> These traits determine the dominance of particular elemental
or energy forces.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Alignment
Traits:</span><span>
Just as characters may be lawful neutral or chaotic good, many planes are tied
to a particular moral or ethical outlook.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Magic
Traits:</span><span>
Magic works differently from plane to plane, and magic traits set the
boundaries for what it can and can’t do.</span></div><br><h3 id="physical-traits">Physical
Traits</h3><div>The
two most important natural laws set by physical traits are how gravity works
and how time passes. Other physical traits pertain to the size and shape of a
plane and how easily a plane’s nature can be altered.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Gravity:</span><span> The direction of
gravity’s pull may be unusual, and it might even change directions within the
plane itself.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Normal
Gravity: </span><span>Most
planes have gravity similar to that of the Material Plane. The usual rules for
ability scores, carrying capacity, and encumbrance apply. Unless otherwise
noted in a description, it is assumed every plane has the normal gravity trait.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Heavy
Gravity: </span><span>The
gravity on a plane with this trait is much more intense than on the Material
Plane. As a result, Balance, Climb, Jump, Ride, Swim, and Tumble checks incur a
–2 circumstance penalty, as do all attack rolls. All item weights are
effectively doubled, which might affect a character’s speed. Weapon ranges are
halved. A character’s Strength and Dexterity scores are not affected.
Characters who fall on a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points of damage for
each 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of damage.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Light
Gravity: </span><span>The
gravity on a plane with this trait is less intense than on the Material Plane.
As a result, creatures find that they can lift more, but their movements tend
to be ungainly. Characters on a plane with the light gravity trait take a –2
circumstance penalty on attack rolls and Balance, Ride, Swim, and Tumble
checks. All items weigh half as much. Weapon ranges double, and characters gain
a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb and Jump checks.</span></div><div>Strength
and Dexterity don’t change as a result of light gravity, but what you can do
with such scores does change. These advantages apply to travelers from other
planes as well as natives.</div><div>Falling
characters on a light gravity plane take 1d4 points of damage for each 10 feet
of the fall (maximum 20d4).</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">No
Gravity: </span><span>Individuals
on a plane with this trait merely float in space, unless other resources are
available to provide a direction for gravity’s pull.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Objective
Directional Gravity: </span><span>The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same
as on the Material Plane, but the direction is not the traditional “down”
toward the ground. It may be down toward any solid object, at an angle to the
surface of the plane itself, or even upward.</span></div><div>In
addition, objective directional gravity may change from place to place. The
direction of “down” may vary.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Subjective
Directional Gravity: </span><span>The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the
same as on the Material Plane, but each individual chooses the direction of
gravity’s pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects and
nonsentient creatures. This sort of environment can be very disorienting to the
newcomer, but is common on “weightless” planes.</span></div><div>Characters
on a plane with subjective directional gravity can move normally along a solid
surface by imagining “down” near their feet. If suspended in midair, a
character “flies” by merely choosing a “down” direction and “falling” that way.
Under such a procedure, an individual “falls” 150 feet in the first round and
300 feet in each succeeding round. Movement is straight-line only. In order to
stop, one has to slow one’s movement by changing the designated “down”
direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and
300 feet per round thereafter).</div><div>It
takes a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action;
this check can be made once per round. Any character who fails this Wisdom
check in successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks until he or
she succeeds.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Time:</span><span> The rate of time’s passage
can vary on different planes, though it remains constant within any particular
plane. Time is always subjective for the viewer. The same subjectivity applies
to various planes. Travelers may discover that they’ll pick up or lose time
while moving among the planes, but from their point of view, time always passes
naturally.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Normal
Time: </span><span>This
trait describes the way time passes on the Material Plane. One hour on a plane
with normal time equals one hour on the Material Plane. Unless otherwise noted
in a description, every plane has the normal time trait.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Timeless:
</span><span>On planes
with this trait, time still passes, but the effects of time are diminished. How
the timeless trait can affect certain activities or conditions such as hunger,
thirst, aging, the effects of poison, and healing varies from plane to plane.</span></div><div>The
danger of a timeless plane is that once one leaves such a plane for one where
time flows normally, conditions such as hunger and aging do occur
retroactively. </div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Flowing
Time: </span><span>On
some planes, time can flow faster or slower. One may travel to another plane,
spend a year there, then return to the Material Plane to find that only six
seconds have elapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only a few seconds
older. But for that traveler and the items, spells, and effects working on him,
that year away was entirely real.</span></div><div>When
designating how time works on planes with flowing time, put the Material
Plane’s flow of time first, followed by the same flow in the other plane. </div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Erratic
Time: </span><span>Some
planes have time that slows down and speeds up, so an individual may lose or
gain time as he moves between the two planes. The following is provided as an
example.</span></div><div class="table-container"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 0px none rgb(128, 128, 128); width: 22em; padding: 0px;"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" style="padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0); width: 7.5em;">d%</td><td width="101" valign="top" style="width: 7.12em; padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">Time

the denizens of such a plane, time flows naturally and the shift is unnoticed.</div><div>If
a plane is timeless with respect to magic, any spell cast with a
noninstantaneous duration is permanent until dispelled.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Shape
and Size:</span><span>
Planes come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Most planes are infinite, or at
least so large that they may as well be infinite.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Infinite:
</span><span>Planes
with this trait go on forever, though they may have finite components within
them. Or they may consist of ongoing expanses in two directions, like a map
that stretches out infinitely.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Finite
Shape: </span><span>A
plane with this trait has defined edges or borders. These borders may adjoin
other planes or hard, finite borders such as the edge of the world or a great
wall. Demiplanes are often finite.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Self-Contained
Shape: </span><span>On
planes with this trait, the borders wrap in on themselves, depositing the
traveler on the other side of the map. A spherical plane is an example of a
self-contained, finite plane, but there can be cubes, toruses, and flat planes
with magical edges that teleport the traveler to an opposite edge when he
crosses them. </span></div><div>Some
demiplanes are self-contained.</div><br><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Morphic
Traits:</span><span>
This trait measures how easily the basic nature of a plane can be changed. Some
planes are responsive to sentient thought, while others can be manipulated only
by extremely powerful creatures. And some planes respond to physical or magical
efforts.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Alterable
Morphic: </span><span>On
a plane with this trait, objects remain where they are (and what they are)
unless affected by physical force or magic. You can change the immediate
environment as a result of tangible effort. </span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Highly
Morphic: </span><span>On
a plane with this trait, features of the plane change so frequently that it’s
difficult to keep a particular area stable. Such planes may react dramatically
to specific spells, sentient thought, or the force of will. Others change for
no reason. </span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Magically
Morphic: </span><span>Specific
spells can alter the basic material of a plane with this trait.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Divinely
Morphic: </span><span>Specific
unique beings (deities or similar great powers) have the ability to alter
objects, creatures, and the landscape on planes with this trait. Ordinary
characters find these planes similar to alterable planes in that they may be
affected by spells and physical effort. But the deities may cause these areas
to change instantly and dramatically, creating great kingdoms for themselves. </span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Static:
</span><span>These
planes are unchanging. Visitors cannot affect living residents of the plane,
nor objects that the denizens possess. Any spells that would affect those on
the plane have no effect unless the plane’s static trait is somehow removed or
suppressed. Spells cast before entering a plane with the static trait remain in
effect, however.</span></div><div>Even
moving an unattended object within a static plane requires a DC 16 Strength
check. Particularly heavy objects may be impossible to move.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Sentient:
</span><span>These
planes are ones that respond to a single thought— that of the plane itself.
Travelers would find the plane’s landscape changing as a result of what the
plane thought of the travelers, either becoming more or less hospitable
depending on its reaction.</span></div><br><h3 id="elemental-and-energy-traits">Elemental and
Energy Traits</h3><div>Four basic
elements and two types of energy together make up everything. The elements are
earth, air, fire, and water. The types of energy are positive and negative.</div><div>The Material
Plane reflects a balancing of those elements and energies; all are found there.
Each of the Inner Planes is dominated by one element or type of energy. Other
planes may show off various aspects of these elemental traits. Many planes have
no elemental or energy traits; these traits are noted in a plane’s description
only when they are present.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Air-Dominant:</span><span> Mostly open space, planes
with this trait have just a few bits of floating stone or other elements. They
usually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a plane may include clouds of
acidic or toxic gas. Creatures of the earth subtype are uncomfortable on
air-dominant planes because they have little or no natural earth to connect
with. They take no actual damage, however.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Earth-Dominant:</span><span> Planes with this trait
are mostly solid. Travelers who arrive run the risk of suffocation if they
don’t reach a cavern or other pocket within the earth. Worse yet, individuals
without the ability to burrow are entombed in the earth and must dig their way
out (5 feet per turn). Creatures of the air subtype are uncomfortable on earth
dominant planes because these planes are tight and claustrophobic to them. But
they suffer no inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Fire-Dominant:
</span><span>Planes
with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn without consuming
their fuel source. Fire-dominant planes are extremely hostile to Material Plane
creatures, and those without resistance or immunity to fire are soon immolated.</span></div><div>Unprotected
wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost
immediately, and those wearing unprotected flammable clothing catch on fire. In
addition, individuals take 3d10 points of fire damage every round they are on a
fire-dominant plane. Creatures of the water subtype are extremely uncomfortable
on fire-dominant planes. Those that are made of water take double damage each
round.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Water-Dominant:</span><span> Planes with this trait
are mostly liquid. Visitors who can’t breathe water or reach a pocket of air
will likely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype are extremely uncomfortable on
water-dominant planes. Those made of fire take 1d10 points of damage each
round.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive-Dominant:
</span><span>An
abundance of life characterizes planes with this trait. The two kinds of
positive-dominant traits are minor positive-dominant and major
positive-dominant. A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion of
life in all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are
louder, and sensations are more intense as a result of the positive energy
swirling through the plane. All individuals in a positive-dominant plane gain
fast healing 2 as an extraordinary ability.</span></div><div>Major
positive-dominant planes go even further. A creature on a major
positive-dominant plane must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being blinded
for 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. Simply being on the plane
grants fast healing 5 as an extraordinary ability. In addition, those at full
hit points gain 5 additional temporary hit points per round. These temporary
hit points fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the major positive-
dominant plane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round
that its temporary hit points exceed its normal hit point total. Failing the
saving throw results in the creature exploding in a riot of energy, killing it.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Negative-Dominant:</span><span> Planes with this trait
are vast, empty reaches that suck the life out of travelers who cross them.
They tend to be lonely, haunted planes, drained of color and filled with winds
bearing the soft moans of those who died within them. As with positive-dominant
planes, negative-dominant planes can be either minor or major. On minor
negative-dominant planes, living creatures take 1d6 points of damage per round.
At 0 hit points or lower, they crumble into ash.</span></div><div>Major
negative-dominant planes are even more severe. Each round, those within must
make a DC 25 Fortitude save or gain a negative level. A creature whose negative
levels equal its current levels or Hit Dice is slain, becoming a wraith. The <span style="font-style: italic;">death
ward </span>spell protects a traveler from the damage and energy drain of a
negative-dominant plane.</div><br><h3 id="alignment-traits">Alignment
Traits</h3><div>Some planes
have a predisposition to a certain alignment. Most of the inhabitants of these
planes also have the plane’s particular alignment, even powerful creatures such
as deities. In addition, creatures of alignments contrary to the plane have a
tougher time dealing with its natives and situations.</div><div>The
alignment trait of a plane affects social interactions there. Characters who
follow other alignments than most of the inhabitants do may find life more
difficult.</div><div>Alignment
traits have multiple components. First are the moral (good or evil) and ethical
(lawful or chaotic) components; a plane can have either a moral component, an
ethical component, or one of each. Second, the specific alignment trait
indicates whether each moral or ethical component is mildly or strongly
evident.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Good-Aligned/Evil-Aligned:
</span><span>These
planes have chosen a side in the battle of good versus evil. No plane can be
both good-aligned and evil-aligned.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Law-Aligned/Chaos-Aligned:</span><span> Law versus chaos is the
key struggle for these planes and their residents. No plane can be both
law-aligned and chaos-aligned.</span></div><br><div>Each
part of the moral/ethical alignment trait has a descriptor, either “mildly” or
“strongly,” to show how powerful the influence of alignment is on the plane.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Mildly
Aligned: </span><span>Creatures
who have an alignment opposite that of a mildly aligned plane take a –2
circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Strongly
Aligned:</span><span>
On planes that are strongly aligned, a –2 circumstance penalty applies on all
Charisma-based checks made by all creatures not of the plane’s alignment. In
addition, the –2 penalty affects all Intelligence-based and Wisdom-based
checks, too.</span></div><div>The penalties
for the moral and ethical components of the alignment trait do stack.</div><br><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Neutral-Aligned:</span><span> A mildly neutral-aligned
plane does not apply a circumstance penalty to anyone.</span></div><div>The
Material Plane is considered mildly neutral-aligned, though it may contain high
concentrations of evil or good, law or chaos in places.</div><div>A
strongly neutral-aligned plane would stand in opposition to all other moral and
ethical principles: good, evil, law, and chaos. Such a plane may be more
concerned with the balance of the alignments than with accommodating and
accepting alternate points of view. In the same fashion as for other strongly
aligned planes, strongly neutral-aligned planes apply a –2 circumstance penalty
to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based checks by any creature that isn’t
neutral. The penalty is applied twice (once for law/chaos, and once for good/evil),
so neutral good, neutral evil, lawful neutral, and chaotic neutral creatures
take a –2 penalty and lawful good, chaotic good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil
creatures take a –4 penalty.</div><br><h3 id="magic-traits">Magic Traits</h3><div>A plane’s magic
trait describes how magic works on the plane compared to how it works on the
Material Plane. Particular locations on a plane (such as those under the direct
control of deities) may be pockets where a different magic trait applies.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Normal
Magic:</span><span>
This magic trait means that all spells and supernatural abilities function as
written. Unless otherwise noted in a description, every plane has the normal
magic trait.</span></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Wild
Magic:</span><span> On
a plane with the wild magic trait spells and spell-like abilities function in
radically different and sometimes dangerous ways. Any spell or spell-like
ability used on a wild magic plane has a chance to go awry. The caster must
make a level check (DC 15 + the level of the spell or effect) for the magic to
function normally. For spell-like abilities, use the level or HD of the
creature employing the ability for the caster level check and the level of the
spell-like ability to set the DC for the caster level check. Failure on this
check means that something strange happens; roll d% and consult the following
table.</span></div><br><div class="table-container"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 0px none rgb(128, 128, 128); width: 53.7em; padding: 0px;"><tbody><tr><td width="61" valign="top" style="width: 5.62em; padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">d%</td><td width="625" valign="top" style="width: 54.1em; padding: 0px 0.52em; font-weight: 700; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">Effect</td></tr><tr><td width="61" valign="top" style="width: 6.07em; padding: 0px 0.52em; text-align: center; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">01–19</td><td width="625" valign="top" style="width: 55.7em; padding: 0px 0.52em; border-bottom: 0.07em solid rgb(0, 0, 0);">Spell

Magic:</span><span>
Particular spells and spell-like abilities are more difficult to cast on planes
with this trait, often because the nature of the plane interferes with the
spell.</span></div><div>To
cast an impeded spell, the caster must make a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + the
level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is
still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell
functions normally.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Enhanced
Magic:</span><span>
Particular spells and spell-like abilities are easier to use or more powerful
in effect on planes with this trait than they are on the Material Plane.</span></div><div>Natives
of a plane with the enhanced magic trait are aware of which spells and
spell-like abilities are enhanced, but planar travelers may have to discover
this on their own.</div><div>If a spell is
enhanced, certain metamagic feats can be applied to it without changing the
spell slot required or the casting time. Spellcasters on the plane are
considered to have that feat or feats for the purpose of applying them to that
spell. Spellcasters native to the plane must gain the feat or feats normally if
they want to use them on other planes as well.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Limited
Magic:</span><span>
Planes with this trait permit only the use of spells and spell-like abilities
that meet particular qualifications.</span></div><div>Magic
can be limited to effects from certain schools or subschools, to effects with
certain descriptors, or to effects of a certain level (or any combination of
these qualities). Spells and spell-like abilities that don’t meet the
qualifications simply don’t work.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Dead
Magic: </span><span>These
planes have no magic at all. A plane with the dead magic trait functions in all
respects like an <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field </span>spell. Divination spells cannot detect
subjects within a dead magic plane, nor can a spellcaster use <span style="font-style: italic;">teleport </span>or
another spell to move in or out. The only exception to the “no magic” rule is
permanent planar portals, which still function normally.</span></div><br><h3 id="how-planes-interact">HOW PLANES
INTERACT</h3><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Separate
Planes:</span><span>
Two planes that are separate do not overlap or directly connect to each other.
They are like planets in different orbits. The only way to get from one
separate plane to the other is to go through a third plane.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Coterminous
Planes:</span><span>
Planes that touch at specific points are coterminous. Where they touch, a
connection exists, and travelers can leave one reality behind and enter the
other.</span></div><div><span style="font-weight: 700;">Coexistent
Planes:</span><span>
If a link between two planes can be created at any point, the two planes are
coexistent. These planes overlap each other completely. A coexistent plane can
be reached from anywhere on the plane it overlaps. When moving on a coexistent
plane, it is often possible to see into or interact with the plane it coexists
with. </span></div><br><div>Layered
Planes</div><div>Infinities
may be broken into smaller infinities, and planes into smaller, related planes.
These layers are effectively separate planes of existence, and each layer can
have its own planar traits. Layers are connected to each other through a
variety of planar gates, natural vortices, paths, and shifting borders.</div><div>Access
to a layered plane from elsewhere usually happens on a specific layer: the
first layer of the plane, which can be either the top layer or the bottom
layer, depending on the specific plane. Most fixed access points (such as
portals and natural vortices) reach this layer, which makes it the gateway for
other layers of the plane. The <span style="font-style: italic;">plane shift </span>spell also deposits the
spellcaster on the first layer of the plane.</div><br><h2 id="plane-descriptions">PLANE
DESCRIPTIONS</h2><br><h3 id="the-material-plane">THE MATERIAL PLANE</h3><div>The
Material Plane is the center of most cosmologies and defines what is considered
normal.</div><div>The
Material Plane has the following traits:</div><div>•
Normal gravity.</div><div>•
Normal Time</div><div>•
Alterable morphic.</div><div>•
No Elemental or Energy Traits (specific locations may have these traits,
however)</div><div>•
Mildly neutral-aligned.</div><div>•
Normal magic. </div><br><h3 id="the-ethereal-plane">THE ETHEREAL PLANE</h3><div>The
Ethereal Plane is coexistent with the Material Plane and often other planes as
well. The Material Plane itself is visible from the Ethereal Plane, but it
appears muted and indistinct, its colors blurring into each other and its edges
turning fuzzy.</div><div>While it is
possible to see into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane, the Ethereal
Plane is usually invisible to those on the Material Plane. Normally, creatures
on the Ethereal Plane cannot attack creatures on the Material Plane, and vice
versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible, incorporeal, and utterly
silent to someone on the Material Plane. </div><div>The
Ethereal Plane is mostly empty of structures and impediments. However, the
plane has its own inhabitants. Some of these are other ethereal travelers, but
the ghosts found here pose a particular peril to those who walk the fog. </div><div>It
has the following traits.</div><div>•
No gravity.</div><div>•
Alterable morphic. The plane contains little to alter, however.</div><div>•
Mildly neutral-aligned.</div><div>•
Normal magic. Spells function normally on the Ethereal Plane, though they do
not cross into the Material Plane. </div><div>The
only exceptions are spells and spell-like abilities that have the force
descriptor and abjuration spells that affect ethereal beings. Spellcasters on
the Material Plane must have some way to detect foes on the Ethereal Plane
before targeting them with force-based spells, of course. While it’s possible
to hit ethereal enemies with a force spell cast on the Material Plane, the
reverse isn’t possible. No magical attacks cross from the Ethereal Plane to the
Material Plane, including force attacks.</div><br><h3 id="plane-of-shadow">PLANE OF SHADOW</h3><div><span style="font-size: 12px;">The
Plane of Shadow is a dimly lit dimension that is both coterminous to and
coexistent with the Material Plane. It overlaps the Material </span><span>Plane much as the Ethereal
Plane does, so a planar traveler can use the Plane of Shadow to cover great
distances quickly.</span></div><div>The
Plane of Shadow is also coterminous to other planes. With the right spell, a
character can use the Plane of Shadow to visit other realities.</div><div>The
Plane of Shadow is a world of black and white; color itself has been bleached
from the environment. It is otherwise appears similar to the Material Plane.</div><div>Despite
the lack of light sources, various plants, animals, and humanoids call the
Plane of Shadow home.</div><div>The
Plane of Shadow is magically morphic, and parts continually flow onto other
planes. As a result, creating a precise map of the plane is next to impossible,
despite the presence of landmarks.</div><div>The
Plane of Shadow has the following traits.</div><div>•
Magically morphic. Certain spells modify the base material of the Plane of
Shadow. The utility and power of these spells within the Plane of Shadow make
them particularly useful for explorers and natives alike.</div><div>•
Mildly neutral-aligned.</div><div>•
Enhanced magic. Spells with the shadow descriptor are enhanced on the Plane of
Shadow. Such spells are cast as though they were prepared with the Maximize
Spell feat, though they don’t require the higher spell slots.</div><div>Furthermore,
specific spells become more powerful on the Plane of Shadow. <span style="font-style: italic;">Shadow
conjuration </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">shadow evocation </span>spells are 30% as powerful as the
conjurations and evocations they mimic (as opposed to 20%). <span style="font-style: italic;">Greater shadow
conjuration </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">greater shadow evocation </span>are 70% as powerful (not
60%), and a <span style="font-style: italic;">shades </span>spell conjures at 90% of the power of the original
(not 80%).</div><div>•
Impeded magic. Spells that use or generate light or fire may fizzle when cast
on the Plane of Shadow. A spellcaster attempting a spell with the light or fire
descriptor must succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + the level of the spell).
Spells that produce light are less effective in general, because all light
sources have their ranges halved on the Plane of Shadow.</div><div>Despite
the dark nature of the Plane of Shadow, spells that produce, use, or manipulate
darkness are unaffected by the plane.</div><br><h3 id="the-astral-plane">THE ASTRAL PLANE</h3><div>The
Astral Plane is the space between the planes. When a character moves through an
interplanar portal or projects her spirit to a different plane of existence,
she travels through the Astral Plane. Even spells that allow instantaneous
movement across a planebriefly touch the Astral Plane.</div><div>The
Astral Plane is a great, endless sphere of clear silvery sky, both above and
below. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the
Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.</div><div>Both
planar travelers and refugees from other planes call the Astral Plane home. </div><div>The Astral
Plane has the following traits.</div><div>•
Subjective directional gravity.</div><div>•
Timeless. Age, hunger, thirst, poison, and natural healing don’t function in
the Astral Plane, though they resume functioning when the traveler leaves the
Astral Plane.</div><div>•
Mildly neutral-aligned.</div><div>• Enhanced
magic. All spells and spell-like abilities used within the Astral Plane may be
employed as if they were improved by the Quicken Spell feat. Already quickened
spells and spell-like abilities are unaffected, as are spells from magic items.
Spells so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified level. As
with the Quicken Spell feat, only one quickened spell can be cast per round.</div><br><h3 id="elemental-plane-of-air">ELEMENTAL PLANE OF
AIR</h3><div>The Elemental
Plane of Air is an empty plane, consisting of sky above and sky below.</div><div>The
Elemental Plane of Air is the most comfortable and survivable of the Inner
Planes, and it is the home of all manner of airborne creatures. Indeed, flying
creatures find themselves at a great advantage on this plane. While travelers
without flight can survive easily here, they are at a disadvantage.</div><div>The
Elemental Plane of Air has the following traits.</div><div>•
Subjective directional gravity. Inhabitants of the plane determine their own
“down” direction. Objects not under the motive force of others do not move.</div><div>•
Air-dominant.</div><div>•
Enhanced magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use, manipulate, or create
air (including spells of the Air domain) are both empowered and enlarged (as if

or outsiders with the earth subtype) are impeded.</div><br><h3 id="elemental-plane-of-earth">ELEMENTAL PLANE OF
EARTH</h3><div>The

unwary and unprepared traveler may find himself entombed within this vast
solidity of material and have his life crushed into nothingness, his powdered
remains a warning to any foolish enough to follow.</div><div>Despite
its solid, unyielding nature, the Elemental Plane of Earth is varied in its
consistency, ranging from relatively soft soil to veins of heavier and more
valuable metal. </div><div>The
Elemental Plane of Earth has the following traits.</div><div>•
Earth-dominant.</div><div>•
Enhanced magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use, manipulate, or create
earth or stone (including those of the Earth domain) are both empowered and
extended (as if the Empower Spell and Extend Spell metamagic feats had been
used on them, but the spells don’t require higher-level slots). Spells and

outsiders with the air subtype) are impeded.</div><br><h3 id="elemental-plane-of-fire">ELEMENTAL PLANE OF
FIRE</h3><div>Everything is
alight on the Elemental Plane of Fire. The ground is nothing more than great,
evershifting plates of compressed flame. The air ripples with the heat of
continual firestorms, and the most common liquid is magma, not water. The
oceans are made of liquid flame, and the mountains ooze with molten lava. Fire
survives here without need for fuel or air, but flammables brought onto the
plane are consumed readily. </div><div>The
Elemental Plane of Fire has the following traits.</div><div>•
Fire-dominant.</div><div>•
Enhanced magic. Spells and spell-like abilities with the fire descriptor are
both maximized and enlarged (as if the Maximize Spell and Enlarge Spell had

(including spells of the Water domain and spells that summon water elementals
or outsiders with the water subtype) are impeded. </div><br><h3 id="elemental-plane-of-water">ELEMENTAL PLANE OF
WATER</h3><div>The
Elemental Plane of Water is a sea without a floor or a surface, an entirely
fluid environment lit by a diffuse glow. It is one of the more hospitable of
the Inner Planes once a traveler gets past the problem of breathing the local
medium.</div><div>The
eternal oceans of this plane vary between ice cold and boiling hot, between
saline and fresh. They are perpetually in motion, wracked by currents and
tides. The plane’s permanent settlements form around bits of flotsam and jetsam
suspended within this endless liquid. These settlements drift on the tides of
the Elemental Plane of Water.</div><div>The
Elemental Plane of Water has the following traits.</div><div>•
Subjective directional gravity. The gravity here works similar to that of the
Elemental Plane of Air. But sinking or rising on the Elemental Plane of Water

PLANE</h3><div>To an observer,
there’s little to see on the Negative Energy Plane. It is a dark, empty place,
an eternal pit where a traveler can fall until the plane itself steals away all
light and life. The Negative Energy Plane is the most hostile of the Inner
Planes, and the most uncaring and intolerant of life. Only creatures immune to
its life-draining energies can survive there. </div><div>The
Negative Energy Plane has the following traits.</div><div>•
Subjective directional gravity.</div><div>•
Major negative-dominant. Some areas within the plane have only the minor negative-dominant
trait, and these islands tend to be inhabited.</div><div>•
Enhanced magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are
maximized (as if the Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but
the spells don’t require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities
that are already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. Class abilities that
use negative energy, such as rebuking and controlling undead, gain a +10 bonus
on the roll to determine Hit Dice affected. </div><div>•
Impeded magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy,

random encounters on the plane are exceedingly rare.</div><br><h3 id="positive-energy-plane">POSITIVE ENERGY
PLANE</h3><div>The
Positive Energy Plane has no surface and is akin to the Elemental Plane of Air
with its wide-open nature. However, every bit of this plane glows brightly with
innate power. This power is dangerous to mortal forms, which are not made to
handle it. Despite the beneficial effects of the plane, it is one of the most
hostile of the Inner Planes. An unprotected character on this plane swells with
power as positive energy is force-fed into her. Then, her mortal frame unable
to contain that power, she immolates as if she were a small planet caught at
the edge of a supernova. Visits to the Positive Energy Plane are brief, and
even then travelers must be heavily protected.</div><div>The
