upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down
a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points
of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke
at whatever target point you choose within the spell’s range (measured from
your position at the time). Any creature in the target square or in the path of
the bolt is affected.</div><div>You
need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even
spellcasting, can be performed. However, each round after the first you may use
a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt. You may call a
total number of bolts equal to your caster level (maximum 10 bolts).</div><div>If
you are outdoors and in a stormy area—a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and
cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni
or an air elemental of at least Large size)—each bolt deals 3d10 points of
electricity damage instead of 3d6.</div><div>This

creatures, but <span style="font-style: italic;">calm emotions </span>can stop raging creatures from fighting or

by spells such as <span style="font-style: italic;">bless, good hope, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">rage, </span>as well as negating
a bard’s ability to inspire courage or a barbarian’s rage ability. It also
suppresses any fear effects and removes the <span style="font-style: italic;">confused </span>condition from all
targets<span style="font-style: italic;">. </span>While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no
effect. When the <span style="font-style: italic;">calm emotions </span>spell ends, the original spell or effect

change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treantlike creature, about
24 feet tall. When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a
special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a
creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends you
and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it
cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is
reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is
destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell
duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the
focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full
strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it
appeared.</div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">Focus:

an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or

nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10- foot radius

spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has
been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement
(provided that the soul is free and willing to return). The original’s physical
remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be
restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural
life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.</div><div>To
create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales,
or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the
original creature’s living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it
must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown
in a laboratory for 2d4 months.</div><div>When
the clone is completed, the original’s soul enters it immediately, if that
creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical with the original
and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other
respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the
dead, including the loss of one level or 2 points of Constitution (if the
original was a 1st-level character). If this Constitution adjustment would give
the clone a Constitution score of 0, the spell fails. If the original creature
has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than
the clone would otherwise be, the clone is one level below the level at which
the original died.</div><div>The

may summon the centipede swarms so that they share the area of other creatures.
The swarms remain stationary, attacking any creatures in their area, unless you
command the creeping doom to move (a standard action). As a standard action,
you can command any number of the swarms to move toward any prey within 100
feet of you. You cannot command any swarm to move more than 100 feet away from
you, and if you move more than 100 feet from any swarm, that swarm remains
stationary, attacking any creatures in its area (but it can be commanded again
if you move within 100 feet).</div><br><h3 id="crushing-despair">Crushing Despair</h3><div>Enchantment
